The FBI is getting ready to analyze around 650,000 emails that are in the laptop of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner to see whether any of them have any relation to a previous investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server. “Metadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the Democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state,”
The probe, which was apparently delayed because agents had to wait for a court order, is expected to take weeks at least. That means that if Clinton wins the election, she will be celebrating with a cloud over her head as the FBI will at least be investigating some of her closest advisers.

0000648,"Trump’s Astounding, Hypocritical Cruelty Peaks With Alicia Machado “Sex Tape” Tweet","Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images
Donald Trump has the biggest platform of any out-of-control bully in the world right now. This week, he’s using it to try and destroy former Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado, who’s spoken out about how
Trump has been ranting nonstop about Machado since Hillary Clinton
The alleged “sex tape” is not a sex tape at all. It’s a night-vision clip from La Granja, a Spanish Big Brother–esque reality program, that appears to show Machado having sex with a man. The clip, from 2005, shows no nudity; both Machado and her partner are covered by sheets. It’s similar to a hundred scenes that have aired on Big Brother, Jersey Shore, or The Real World.
Though the clip has been available for a decade, it’s safe to say that few people knew or cared about it until the Trump campaign thrust it into the political news cycle. Today, the world is dissecting it. The abject cruelty and cynicism of this move is staggering. Machado isn’t running for political office; there’s no reason for Trump to attack her for something unrelated to her claims against him. He’s trying to besmirch her character as if it were relevant, as if she were his opponent. Her appearance on a sexy reality show has no bearing on her Miss Universe story, yet he’s acting as if this video clip invalidates it. Hillary did not present her as an “angel” or “paragon of virtue,” as Trump tweeted. She presented Machado as a regular woman who was bullied mercilessly by an entitled, insecure man who gets off on putting women down. One need not be “
Having sex on a reality show is nothing to be ashamed about. But Trump’s use of this clip as a weapon against her character—her reliability, her capacity to inspire sympathy, her deserving of kind treatment—is callous and low. It’s also extraordinarily hypocritical. Trump is
Machado, all power to her, is taking Trump’s infantile harassment in stride. In
Trump’s capacity for no-holds-barred shaming of anyone and everyone should give voters cause for deep concern. Even worse, perhaps, is the fact that he can’t stop himself from bullying people even when it’s not in his political interest. His feuds with the Khans and Machado make him look like a cartoonish mob boss seeking sadistic revenge on anyone with less political power than he has. Trump cannot stop punching down until he’s launched every low blow he can dream up. As Clinton tweeted on Friday morning, that’s simply not an appropriate disposition for a president.
What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?
When something gets under Donald's thin skin, he lashes out and can't let go. This is dangerous for a president.
Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell—an accomplished actor. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight—when she was pregnant. Pathetic.
In previous elections, Trump’s brand of mean-spirited smears might have been outsourced to shady PACs and third-level surrogates, leaving the candidate to rise above the messy fracas. Surely, that’s what the GOP would prefer. But party leaders only have themselves to blame for the anger, conspiracy theories, and racist panic that’s led to Trump’s rise; they deserve whatever bad press Trump earns for them with his extended temper tantrum.

0000649,Max Boot: Republicans have Stockholm Syndrome and it’s getting worse,"The lobotomization of the Republican Party appeared complete last year when the same GOP paladins who had denounced Donald Trump as a “lunatic trying to get ahold of nuclear weapons” (Marco Rubio), as a bigot who was guilty of “the textbook definition of a racist comment” (Paul Ryan), and as a “narcissist,” “serial philanderer,” “pathological liar,” and “bully” (Ted Cruz) nevertheless endorsed him for the most powerful position in the world.
Tragedy turned to farce (or is it the other way around?) after the emergence of the “grab ‘em by the pussy” tape on October 7, 2016. Republicans such as Sens. John Thune, Mike Crapo and Deb Fischer called for Trump to leave the race on the grounds that he was unfit for office, only to change their minds and re-endorse him when it became evident that he was still polling strongly among base voters.
But the Republicans’ race to the bottom — to the absolute lowest moral and intellectual depths — wasn’t over last year, and it’s not over now. It’s still continuing, with even supposedly “normal,” “moderate,” “mainstream” Republicans increasingly echoing Trump’s know-nothing effusions.
In Virginia, Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman and counselor to “compassionate conservative” George W. Bush, is attacking his Democratic opponent for governor, Ralph Northam, for being too sympathetic to immigrants and too unsympathetic to Confederate monuments. One particularly incendiary commercial accuses Northam of “increasing the threat of MS-13,” a drug gang from El Salvador that is evoked with pictures of tattooed gang-bangers who actually belong to a rival outfit.
Gillespie’s tendentious reasoning? Northam voted against a bill in Congress that would have prohibited the establishment of any “sanctuary cities,” even though Virginia does not have any such cities. MS-13 has long been a favorite Trump target, symbolizing the supposed menace of Latino immigration.
The current chair of the RNC, Ronna Romney McDaniel, has been equally eager to serve as a Trump echo chamber. Her Twitter feed gives sycophancy a bad name. Recent tweets: “No one recognizes the importance of women’s empowerment better than @IvankaTrump. She’s paving the way worldwide”; “Wonderful to finally have a @POTUS who isn’t ashamed to stand up for religious liberties”; and “Ratings for unpatriotic NFL declining? Shocked.” If Trump claimed the moon was made of Swiss cheese, McDaniel would be mocking anyone who said it was actually Camembert.
In her willingness to serve as a Trump enabler, McDaniel is matched, and perhaps exceeded, by the senior-most Republican officials in the land. Who can forget Vice President Mike Pence going to the Colts-49ers game on Oct. 8 for the express purpose of walking out to express disapproval of players kneeling during the national anthem? Trump has fixated on this non-issue as a way to mobilize his white, working-class base by anathematizing wealthy African-American athletes. And Pence is happy to play along. Just as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is happy to vouch for Trump as a non-racist despite decades of Archie Bunker-style comments suggesting otherwise. “His heart’s in the right place,” Ryan said, making one wonder whether he has access to a super-secret EKG.
The leaders of Congress seem to be suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, which by now should really be renamed Republican Syndrome. There, on Monday, was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell singing kumbaya with Trump in the White House Rose Garden only hours after the president disavowed any blame for “not getting the job done” legislatively. “I’m not gong to blame myself, I’ll be honest,” Trump said. (When has he ever blamed himself for anything?) “They’re not getting the job done.” In case there is any doubt about who “they” is, Trump has been explicit in calling out McConnell as a weak leader, tweeting in August, “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal &amp; Replace for 7 years, he failed!” McConnell nevertheless pledged fealty to his abuser. “Contrary to what some of you may have reported,” he dutifully intoned, “we are together totally on this agenda to move America forward.”
The excuse for this craven behavior is that all qualms about Trump - the least presidential president in the whole history of this republic, or any other - must be subordinated to the Republican policy agenda. You know, the agenda that Trump is not actually passing.
This GOP attitude was taken to its logical if laughable extreme when Sen. Rob Portman, another supposed Republican adult, was asked about the victory in Alabama’s Senate special election primary of far-right rabble-rouser Roy Moore, who makes Trump seem wonkish by comparison. Portman’s only response? “He’s going to be for tax reform, I think.” Never mind about the Constitution, which Moore and Trump both seek to shred in their own ways — Moore is opposed to the separation of church and state, Trump to the freedom of the press. (He thinks that “it is frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write.”) As long as they’re for tax cuts, we’re all good!
There are, to be sure, a few honorable exceptions — prominent Republicans who are willing to speak the truth about the naked emperor — but they are a miniscule minority in a nation in which their party dominates every branch of government.
One of the most prominent truth-tellers is Sen. John McCain, who voted against the abomination that Republican leaders slapped together at the last minute to make good on Trump’s pledge to “repeal and replace” ObamaCare. Receiving the Liberty Medal at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, McCain gave a typically courageous, clear-eyed speech Monday in which he denounced Trumpism root and branch.
“To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century,” he said, “to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘the last best hope of earth’ for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.” But then McCain has long been a “maverick” distrusted by the same rank-and-file Republicans who now eagerly embrace Trump, his opposite in every respect.
McCain’s fellow senator from Arizona, Jeff Flake, also has been outspoken in denouncing Trump. “We pretended the emperor wasn’t naked,” he wrote in his recent book, Conscience of a Conservative. “Even worse: We checked our critical faculties at the door and pretended that the emperor was making sense.” Flake’s reward for his truth-telling? He is in danger of losing next year’s primary to the odious Kelli Ward, an overly eager office-seeker who, following McCain’s diagnosis of brain cancer this summer, immediately called on him to quit the Senate so that the governor could appoint her in his place. Civilized conduct is not only unnecessary in today’s GOP, it is actually distrusted as the sign of a “RINO (Republican in Name Only) cuck.”
Sen. Bob Corker, one of Trump’s initial establishment enablers, has recently taken to telling the truth about the president, but only because he has decided not to seek re-election. The reaction to Corker’s comments — he said that Trump is treating the presidency like a “reality show,” that his aides are desperately trying to “contain him,” and that he is setting us on “the path to World War III” — has been telling. Other Republicans aren’t stepping forward to disagree, and Corker says that virtually all of his fellow Republican senators agree with him. But instead of saying in public what they say in private, these invertebrate officeholders try to change the subject or simply refuse to comment.
They are a profile in cowardice, these Republicans, and they are making a mockery of their oaths to “support and defend the Constitution.” If they truly believe that Trump is not fit for office, then they have an obligation to impeach and remove him. Instead they choose to act as if Trump is their partner in governing. In the process, the entire Republican Party is making itself ever-more complicit in Trump’s crimes — which range from offenses against good sense, rationality and common decency to, perhaps, actual violations of the law such as obstruction of justice.
It becomes ever harder to disagree with the verdict of foreign-policy sage Robert Kagan, like me an erstwhile Republican, who writes that the GOP in its current form is doomed and that Republicans who cannot stomach Trumpism “should change their registration and start voting for Democratic moderates and centrists, as some Republicans did in Virginia recently, to give them a leg up in their fight against the party’s left wing.”
This is truly Trump’s party, and that leaves me to root for Democrats to win a landslide victory in the midterm elections next fall. I have my differences with many Democratic candidates, but on the most important issue facing our nation — whether Trump is fit for office — they are right and Republicans are a disgrace.",unknown,True

0000651,GOP must denounce Trump for embrace of white supremacists,"Donald Trump has dropped all pretense and proudly raised the banner of white racial grievance. The time has come for Republicans in Congress to decide whether this is what they signed up for.
Business leaders decided that they'd had enough, quitting two presidential advisory councils before Trump quickly dissolved the panels. Military leaders made their call as well, issuing statements – in the wake of Charlottesville – making clear they embrace diversity and reject bigotry.
With only a few exceptions, however, GOP political leaders have been too timid to denounce the president and the reprehensible game of racial politics he's playing. I think the corporate chief executives who bailed are making the right bet: History will remember who spoke out, who was complicit, and who stood idly by.
On Twitter (where else?) Trump poured salt in the nation's wounds by coming out firmly against the removal of public monuments to the Confederacy – the issue that brought white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to Charlottesville and led to the death of Heather Heyer.
""Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,"" he wrote. ""You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson – who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!""
Trump can't possibly be so dense that he doesn't see a clear distinction between the men who founded this nation and those who tried to rip it apart.
Trump may indeed not know that most of those Confederate monuments were erected not in the years right after the Civil War but around the turn of the 20th century, when the Jim Crow system of state-enforced racial oppression was being established. They symbolize not history but the defiance of history; they celebrate not defeat on the battlefield but victory in putting uppity African Americans back in their place.
For Trump, the important thing is to tell the white voters who constitute his base that they are being disrespected and dispossessed. It's a cynical and dangerous ploy.
We know this is Trump's game because White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon told us so. In an interview with journalist Robert Kuttner of The American Prospect, Bannon is quoted as saying: ""The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.""
But Trump's base won't identify with Nazis and the KKK. That's why Trump maintained – falsely – that among the torch-bearing Charlottesville white supremacists there were also plenty of ""nice people.""
That's probably also why Bannon, in the interview with Kuttner, referred to the white-power clowns as, well, ""clowns."" He's smart enough to reassure Trump supporters that they're not like those racists and that all the racial game-playing is on the other side.
Trump's desperation is palpable. His approval ratings have slid perilously close to the danger zone where Republican officeholders no longer fear crossing him.
For titans of the business community, the chief executives of such companies as General Electric, Campbell Soup, Johnson &amp; Johnson and 3M decided they could no longer serve on Trump's advisory Manufacturing Council or his Strategy &amp; Policy Forum.
Prospects that Trump can actually follow through on a business-friendly agenda, including tax reform, look increasingly dim. And Trump's ""many sides"" reaction to Charlottesville wasn't going over at all well with employees, customers or the executives themselves.
""Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country,"" JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon wrote in a message to his employees.
The chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and National Guard also publicly condemned hate groups in the wake of Charlottesville. They, of course, could not mention the commander in chief by name.

0000652,Liberals Outraged Over Photo of Illegals in Cages. There’s Only One Problem…,"Photos of detained illegal immigrants in cage-like cells went viral this weekend. Liberals were all too quick to spread this shocking photograph, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.
Is there nothing the left won’t do to slander President Donald Trump? The answer, of course, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being as underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible. Also, being as dishonest as a snake.
Over the course of Trump’s time in office, we’ve seen liberals do some shockingly terrible things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, country of origin, and even her accent, proving who the real racists and sexists are.
They’ve attacked Trump’s family, including his young son. Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s mental health, even calling Barron handicapped. That’s not even mentioning the numerous times that left-wing outlets edited videos or photos to make Trump look like a bad guy.
But what they did this weekend really takes the cake. A photo went viral across Twitter. The ugly picture depicted detained illegal immigrants. These people — arrested by our government — were forced to stay in cages resembling dog kennels. Liberals, as you can imagine, were beside themselves, attacking Trump for an obvious act of cruelty and evil.
It’s too bad that these liberals didn’t bother to check the date on the picture.
Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted tweet, linked to an AZCentral.com article titled, “First glimpse of immigrant children at holding facility” and said “This is happening right now, and the only debate that matter is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.”
His obvious intent was to slam the Trump administration for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source:
Jon Favreau was one of many liberals who attacked Trump over this injustice. The famed Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he knew how better things were under the last administration, right? This liberal celebrity is probably horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, who could allow something as evil as this:
Liberals across the spectrum of stupid chimed in with their condemnations of President Donald Trump.
This makes me sad and angry.

I saw this photo floating around and didn’t know if it was real.
It is.
Children of immigrants are being held in cages, like dogs, at ICE detention centers, sleeping on the floor. It’s an abomination.
FULL STORY:
— Shaun King (@ShaunKing)
Take a look at these photos.
— Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour)
How terrible! What vicious, vile cruelty against innocent illegals. Surely the man responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.
But wait, let’s look at the original article. It was from ACCentral.com. According to the date, this was written in 2014.
This “bombshell” story came out four years ago. Yet, for some reason, nobody was outraged. Liberals weren’t storming Twitter with demands for change. They weren’t calling Obama racist for treating children like this. Why weren’t the overlords within the mainstream media demanding answers from his administration?
Seems like liberals didn’t really care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they daily accuse Trump of racism, based on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism. He’s not treating illegals like animals. But while Trump calls vile MS-13 members “animals,” Obama was treating children like animals. Really makes you think.
Liberals, in their feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed one of Obama’s many sins. And their own. You see, they don’t give a damn about illegal immigrants. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration. Before Trump proposed the wall, liberals didn’t think twice about illegals. We know that for a fact because this article has been around for FOUR YEARS, and they’ve said nothing.
They dishonestly tried to pass this off as current, only for it to blow up in their faces. Any response liberals? Are you going to denounce the absolute evil committed under Obama’s watch?

0000655,Who Are ‘The People’ Anyway?,"I’m asking these questions because I’d like to know how 39 percent of the voting public can become all of “the people.” I asked myself a similar question as I read The Revolt of the Elites by Christopher Lasch—
Non-leftist populists have certain groups in mind when they use their conjuring term, just as Democrats do when they refer to grievance-bearing lifestyle and racial minorities as “the people.” Lasch, a defender of settled communities, typically holds up as his paradigm a mid-twentieth century working-class family, featuring very traditional gender roles. Lasch’s ideal mommy packs a lunch pail for his ideal blue-collar dad, who goes off to work in a factory. This is also the image of the populist family that comes to mind when Pat Buchanan tells us about the declining rustbelt and about all of the jobs that have fled from our blue-collar communities to Third World countries. Unlike Buchanan—who is linked to the Old Right—Lasch was considered to be a part of the socialist Left during his lifetime. And yet, the two figures are rhetorically and often programmatically indistinguishable. Both would now exemplify a populism of the Right, combining demands for the protection of the indigenous workforce with fond images of a disappearing America. Since I can easily identify with these images, I am noting this regretfully.
By contrast, most of those who I hear celebrating Trumpian populism—like Sean Hannity and Newt Gingrich on Fox News—are not about to restore “the people” as they used to be, or at least how they were perceived to be. After all, cohesive societies with traditional gender and family roles that right-wing populists once took for granted are now much weaker than they once were. The last thing that our would-be populists would want to do is face the rage of LGBT and feminist activists on the social Left, and the unavoidable media outrage. Our self-advertised populists do not therefore attempt to take us back to mid-twentieth century communities, lest they be accused of praising the bad old times. In any case, Trumpian populists have different priorities. For example, Hannity and other pundits on Fox News want to mobilize their viewers against the Democrats and in favor of Republican political candidates. Although they occasionally criticize the GOP for not being up to speed, they then go on to hammer the Democrats for not caring about “the people.” We are urged to help “our president”
Reading Breitbart, one gets the impression that their staff’s understanding of populism is simply to support Trump at every turn, except when Steve Bannon decides to break ranks (such as on DACA). Other Trumpian populist websites, such as American Greatness and a more
Since the latter are closely tied to Bill Kristol and became almost uniformly Never-Trumpers, their rivals predictably jumped onto the Trump-train. They thereupon set up websites that imbued populist rhetoric. This, of course, is something that neither Kristol nor his East Coast Straussian friends—who seem ecstatically happy with Washington and the Deep State—would ever attempt. To their credit, West Coast Straussian websites often post commentaries on legal and judicial matters that elicit my total agreement. I would be delighted if these websites simply stated some of their signature positions, such as criticizing judicial activism, without claiming to represent an entity called “the people.”
All that seems left of populism, a movement that arose in late 19th century America among rural and small-town populations, are a political style and distrust of elites. Unlike those who today appropriate this identity, American populists historically desired to return all domestic politics to the states and to create public utilities. Needless to say, I’m not hearing today’s so-called populists calling for either. It is entirely possible to criticize the centralized administrative state, crony capitalism, and the coercive imposition of Political Correctness without claiming (anachronistically) to be a populist. And one can and should engage in such criticism without pretending counterfactually to be speaking for “the people.”

0000656,Trump To Puerto Rico: Drop Dead,"How low can Donald Trump go?
President Trump served notice Thursday that he may pull back federal relief workers from Puerto Rico, effectively threatening to abandon the U.S. territory amid a staggering humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
Declaring the U.S. territory’s electrical grid and infrastructure to have been a “disaster before hurricanes,” Trump wrote Thursday that it will be up to Congress how much federal money to appropriate to the island for its recovery efforts and that recovery workers will not stay “forever.”
In a trio of tweets, Trump wrote” “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military &amp; the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”
Three weeks since Maria made landfall, much of Puerto Rico, an island of 3.4 million people, the vast majority of the island remains without power. Residents struggle to find clean water, hospitals are running short on medicine and commerce is slow with many businesses closed.
Trump on Thursday sought to shame the territory for its own plight. He tweeted, “Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.” And he quoted Sharyl Attkisson, a television journalist, as saying, “Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.”
Those people — those
Come on, Congress, get into this! Republican members, do you have any heart, any spine? Stand up to this cruelty. We are the richest and most powerful nation in the world. It disgraces us that an American president would talk this way about the suffering.
Even if we allow for the logistical problems in delivering and distributing food and water to everyone on the island, this is an inexcusable failure that needs to be corrected immediately. If a similar number of Americans on the mainland were without food and potable water for this long, it would be treated as a major scandal and it would be the top story in the news every day. Because it is happening in a territory with no political clout, it is not being taken as seriously as it should be. While the president repeatedly congratulates himself on what a great job he imagines he has done, the federal response to the disaster in Puerto Rico has been unacceptably poor. In terms of providing the most basic necessities in the wake of a major disaster, the government is failing millions of its citizens.

The Bush Administration aggressively moved to expand executive power, drawing on the dubious legal maneuvering of David Addington, John Yoo, and their enablers. Starting in 2005, the junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, would repeatedly insist that Bush’s assertions of executive power violated the Constitution. Nonetheless, Obama inherited a newly powerful executive branch, just as Cheney had hoped. And rather than dismantle it, Obama spent two terms lending the imprimatur of centrist, establishment bipartisanship to Cheney’s vision.
Now, Donald Trump is coming.
Civil libertarians have long warned the partisans who trusted Bush and Obama, and the establishment centrists who couldn’t imagine anyone in the White House besides an Al Gore or John Kerry or John McCain or Mitt Romney, that they were underestimating both the seriousness of civil liberties abuses under Bush and Obama and the likelihood of even less responsible leaders wreaking havoc in the White House.
Three years ago, in “
Now, Donald Trump is coming. And many establishment centrists are professing alarm. There is nothing more establishment than Robert Kagan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, writing an op-ed in the Washington Post. He begins by observing that if Trump wins, his coalition will include tens of millions of Americans.
“Imagine the power he would wield then,” Kagan
Kagan’s article seemed well-received among establishment centrists.
Yet neither he nor most others who share his fears have yet acknowledged their bygone failures of imagination, or granted that civil libertarians were right: The establishment has permitted the American presidency to get dangerously powerful.
While writing or sharing articles that compare Trump to Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco, few if any have called on Obama or Congress to act now “
With a reality-TV bully on the doorstep of the White House, still they hesitate to urge reform to a branch of government they’ve long regarded as more than co-equal.
Their inaction is irresponsible.
Just as the conservative movement is duty bound to grapple with its role in a populist demagogue seizing control of the GOP, establishment centrists ought to grapple with the implicit blessing they’ve given to the extraordinary powers Trump would inherit, and that even the less-risky choice, Hillary Clinton, would abuse.
The exercise would prove uncomfortable. The establishment centrists who oppose Trump worry, as they should, that he will violate the civil liberties of Muslim Americans, yet few spoke up when Michael Bloomberg presided over a secret program that profiled and spied on Muslim American students, generating zero counterterrorism leads.
The establishment centrists who denounced Edward Snowden would have to admit that, if Trump is half as bad as they fear, Americans will be better served knowing the scope and capabilities of NSA surveillance than living in ignorance of it. Some will be forced to admit to themselves that they hope the military remains sprinkled with whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning to speak out against serious abuses.
For 16 years or more, establishment centrists have been complicit in a historically reckless trend. Come 2017, it may place Donald Trump at a big table, much like the one on The Apprentice, where he’ll decide not which B-list celebrity to fire, but which humans to kill. Establishment centrists could work to strip the presidency of that power.
Instead they do nothing.

Haley called out many of the nations that violated the United Nations directorate and continued to trade with North Korea. She demanded that all nations cut out all ties with the country.
Haley also referenced the “incomprehensible nature” of the regime that provided the circumstances for a military defector to be found with numerous parasites.
Haley said that President Trump had spoken with President Xi Jinping of China Wednesday morning “and told him that we have come to the point that China must cut off the oil from North Korea.”
“China can do this on its own, or we can take the oil situation into our own hands,” she warned, implying that the United States would end the oil trade between China and North Korea by force if need be.
“North Korea’s dictator made a decision that takes world closer to war, not further away,” she said in her statement. “If war comes, it will be because of continued acts of aggression.”

0000666,Louis CK Pens Scathing Anti-Trump Letter: Trump ‘Is Hitler’ and ‘We Are Being Germany in the 30s’,"There’s no doubt that Donald Trump, the GOP’s presidential frontrunner, is great for TV ratings. CBS Chairman Les Moonves recently remarked, “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” He’s an animated character—orange, cotton candy hair, tiny hands, dictatorial posture—like a cross between Mussolini, whose philosophy he
CK’s politics have always been fairly nebulous and hard to pin down. Speaking
“I don’t have any political opinions, I just am very curious,” he said. “And it’s very interesting to listen to what people say. What’s the best way to run a country and the world? Those are really profound questions. I don’t have the confidence to say that I know one way or another. Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I’m very suspicious. It doesn’t make sense to me that you’d have the same solution to every issue. I just like listening. I try to take people who are way far away from what I think or understand and put a representative of them on my show. I like to try to learn form them.”
And years ago, well before Trump ran for president, CK told a story to a radio station about how he once rode the elevator with Trump at Trump’s Castle (now the Golden Nugget)—his sprawling casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. “[Trump] just looked miserable,” said CK. “He looked so unhappy. And all that money, I realized he has all these billions of dollars, but he’s fuckin’ miserable because he needs $100 billion to look in the mirror and not want to kill himself.”
Well, Louis CK has apparently learned all he has to from candidate Trump. The anti-Trump screed came at the end of CK’s email newsletter touting his new show Horace and Pete—a very long, very pointed postscript. You can read it here:
P.S. Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.
And I’m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren’t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time.
Trump is not that. He's an insane bigot. He is dangerous.
He already said he would expand libel laws to sue anyone who ""writes a negative hit piece"" about him. He says ""I would open up the libel laws so we can sue them and win lots of money. Not like now. These guys are totally protected."" He said that. He has promised to decimate the first amendment. (If you think he’s going to keep the second amendment intact you’re delusional.) And he said that Paul Ryan, speaker of the house will ""pay"" for criticizing him. So I'm saying this now because if he gets in there we won't be able to criticize him anymore.
Please pick someone else. Like John Kasich. I mean that guy seems okay. I don't like any of them myself but if you're that kind of voter please go for a guy like that. It feels like between him and either democrat we'd have a decent choice. It feels like a healthier choice. We shouldn't have to vote for someone because they're not a shocking cunt billionaire liar.
We should choose based on what direction the country should go.
I get that all these people sound like bullshit soft criminal opportunists. The whole game feels rigged and it's not going anywhere but down anymore. I feel that way sometimes.
And that voting for Trump is a way of saying ""fuck it. Fuck them all"". I really get it. It's a version of national Suicide. Or it's like a big hit off of a crack pipe. Somehow we can't help it. Or we know that if we vote for Trump our phones will be a reliable source of dopamine for the next four years. I mean I can't wait to read about Trump every day. It's a rush. But you have to know this is not healthy.
If you are a true conservative. Don't vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you.
In fact, if you do vote for Trump, at least look at him very carefully first. You owe that to the rest of us. Know and understand who he is. Spend one hour on google and just read it all. I don’t mean listen to me or listen to liberals who put him down. Listen to your own people. Listen to John Mccain. Go look at what he just said about Trump. ""At a time when our world has never been more complex or more in danger... I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our party's most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world.”
When Trump was told what he said, Trump said ""Oh, he did? Well, that's not nice,"" he told CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. ""He has to be very careful.""
When pressed on why, Trump tacked on: ""He'll find out.”
(I cut and pasted that from CBS news)
Do you really want a guy to be president who threatens John McCain? Because John McCain cautiously and intelligently asked for people to be thoughtful before voting for him? He didn’t even insult Trump. He just asked you to take a good look. And Trump told him to look out.
Remember that Trump entered this race by saying that McCain is not a war hero. A guy who was shot down, body broken and kept in a POW camp for years. Trump said “I prefer the guys who don’t get caught.” Why did he say that? Not because he meant it or because it was important to say. He said it because he’s a bully and every bully knows that when you enter a new school yard, you go to the toughest most respected guy on the yard and you punch him in the nose. If you are still standing after, you’re the new boss. If Trump is president, he’s not going to change. He’s not going to do anything for you. He’s going to do everything for himself and leave you in the dust.
So please listen to fellow conservatives. But more importantly, listen to Trump. Listen to all of it. Everything he says. If you liked when he said that “torture works” then go look at where he took it back the next day. He’s a fucking liar.
A vote for Trump is so clearly a gut-vote, and again I get it. But add a little brain to it and look the guy up. Because if you vote for him because of how you feel right now, the minute he's president, you're going to regret it. You're going to regret it even more when he gives the job to his son. Because American democracy is broken enough that a guy like that could really fuck things up. That's how Hitler got there. He was voted into power by a fatigued nation and when he got inside, he did all his Hitler things and no one could stop him.
Again, I’m not saying vote democrat or vote for anyone else. If Hilary ends up president it should be because she faced the best person you have and you and I both chose her or him or whoever. Trump is not your best. He’s the worst of all of us. He’s a symptom to a problem that is very real. But don’t vote for your own cancer. You’re better than that.
That's just my view. At least right now. I know I’m not qualified or particularly educated and I'm not right instead of you. I’m an idiot and I'm sure a bunch of you are very annoyed by this. Fucking celebrity with an opinion. I swear this isn’t really a political opinion. You don’t want to know my political opinions. (And I know that I’m only bringing myself trouble with this shit.) Trump has nothing to do with politics or ideology. He has to do with himself. And really I don't mean to insult anyone. Except Trump. I mean to insult him very much. And really I’m not saying he’s evil or a monster. In fact I don’t think Hitler was. The problem with saying that guys like that are monsters is that we don’t see them coming when they turn out to be human, which they all are. Everyone is. Trump is a messed up guy with a hole in his heart that he tries to fill with money and attention. He can never ever have enough of either and he’ll never stop trying. He’s sick. Which makes him really really interesting. And he pulls you towards him which somehow feels good or fascinatingly bad. He’s not a monster. He’s a sad man. But all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president. Give him another TV show. Let him pay to put his name on buildings. But please stop voting for him.

0000667,Bill Maher’s Urgent Plea for Decency in U.S. Politics: ‘Trump Didn’t Create This Swamp’,"After a few weeks off,
The comedian addressed the week’s biggest controversy during his monologue—Trump finally acknowledging after being at the forefront of a five-year racist crusade against the first black president that Barack Obama was born in the United States. As is his wont, the bloated ex-reality show host delivered the news
“He blamed it on Hillary. Of course,” said Maher, rolling his eyes. “Because even when [Trump] admits he lies, he has to tell another giant lie! He says Hillary and her campaign started birtherism in 2008, which is something contradicted only by newspapers, television, Twitter, eyes, ears, and smell. Hillary started birtherism? Oh yes, I think we all remember that. I think it was right after Hillary’s casinos went bankrupt.”
A softball, Fallon-esque softball interview with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway—who’s been a guest and pal of Maher’s for twenty years dating back to his ABC series Politically Incorrect—followed, as did a bickering panel wherein political pundit Margaret Hoover, serving as the moderate voice of reason, assured the American people that the country “will survive” regardless of who wins the presidency (Hoover is also the wife of Daily Beast EIC John Avlon).
But the night’s biggest highlight came courtesy of Maher himself. During a his “New Rules” segment, he delivered an important monologue about the need for a return to decency in American politics.
“Both candidates must sign a pledge that whoever loses the election in November, whether it’s Hillary or whether it’s Orange Hitler, the loser has to congratulate the winner and concede graciously. Why? Because civility is nearly dead in this country and we need to return to some basic level of bipartisan decency and respect for our opponents,” offered Maher.
“If you want to know why our country is so tense and our government doesn’t work, it’s because society functions on some basic rules of conduct and they’re all going away. It’s why filibustering has become not a rare principled protest, but the everyday automatic cockblocking that defines government now,” he continued. “Ted Cruz filibustered Obamacare for nearly a day by reading Green Eggs and Ham: a book about how you might like something if you give it a chance. It’s why Republicans, who claim to worship the Constitution, can just ignore their duty in fulfilling a Supreme Court vacancy. And speaking of the Supreme Court, which used to stay supremely out of partisan bickering, it’s why Ruth Bader Ginsburg—yes, even sweet, scholarly, grandmotherly Ruth Bader Ginsburg—talked trash about Trump this year like she was in a rap battle.”
“But I gotta tell ya: Donald Trump didn’t create this swamp. He just rose from it. He and Hillary are the first two candidates in memory not to call and congratulate each other after they won their respective races. Forever, that’s what people did! Even Al Gore called George W. Bush after he lost—and he didn’t even lose! In the Senate, members used to refer to each other as ‘my friend from the other side of the aisle.’ They didn’t mean it literally, of course—no one thinks of Ted Cruz as a friend—but you say it anyway.”
Maher then pointed to the birther movement as playing a large role in the disintegration of bipartisanship in America, but also to when Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouted “You lie!” at POTUS while he delivered a 2009 speech to the joint session of Congress, as well as racist and homophobic Maine Gov. Paul LePage leaving a voicemail for one of his political opponents labeling him a “socialist cocksucker.”
“I keep saying that this election is a referendum on decency. It’s a chance to reject the gutter and punish people who want to live there, but right now, we are rewarding them,” said Maher. “The guy who said ‘You lie?’ The next day donations poured into his coffers because now in America, when you act like an asshole you’re a hero.”
He then cut to footage of politicians coming to blows in various parliaments around the world. “This is what parliament looks like on a bad day in the Ukraine. And here’s the Turkish parliament. And the one in South Korea. And the one in Nepal. Yeah, we laugh at it, but that is where we’re headed, because the real infectious disease that’s threatening our election isn’t pneumonia—it’s a total lack of class.”",unknown,False
0000668,Seth Meyers Calls Out Thrice-Married Trump’s Infidelity Hypocrisy,"Whereas
“Trump went on for days insisting that he won the debate, while also complaining about his broken microphone,” said Meyers, adding, “Trump’s campaign did try [to move on], telling the media that at a rally on Saturday night Trump would ‘…deliver a nine-sentence critique of comments Hillary Clinton made months ago about many of the millennials supporting her primary rival, Bernie Sanders.’”
Those comments, which were misinterpreted by Politico and The Intercept, actually served as an example of Hillary showing empathy toward Sanders supporters—a sentiment echoed by Sanders himself, who said her comments were
“Trump has essentially been in the middle of the same run-on sentence for about a year now. And unfortunately for his campaign, he went on so many angry, unhinged tangents that, according to The Washington Post, ‘It took Trump 25 minutes to read the [nine-sentence] statement,’” said Meyers. “Why did it take 25 minutes to get through nine sentences? Because Trump had to do some classic stand-up comedy: like when he mocked Hillary Clinton’s pneumonia—and a brief fainting spell she suffered as a result.”
“And then Trump,” added Meyers, “who has spent days attacking Hillary Clinton for her husband’s infidelities, claimed that Hillary herself had probably cheated on Bill.”
Cue Trump at the rally: “Hillary Clinton’s only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself. I don’t even think she’s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth.”
Yep, you read that right: Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton, a woman who’s held her family together amid affairs by her husband, of committing adultery based on no evidence whatsoever. But, like most accusations hurled by Trump, it’s pure projection.
For if you recall, Trump is on his third marriage. His first, to Ivana, ended acrimoniously when Trump carried on a very public affair with Marla Maples. “By 1987, during services at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, Trump was secretly romancing Maples as he found ways to temporarily ditch Ivana and their kids,”
“Of course, Trump’s own first marriage ended when he cheated on [Ivana] with his eventual second wife [Maples],” said Meyers. “So you might think maybe this isn’t the best argument for Trump to make—which is why the Trump team sent their best man, Rudy Giuliani, to go on TV and make it again.”
Sure enough, the former New York mayor appeared on numerous cable-news programs defending Trump’s baseless smear against Hillary, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper it was “fair game” and Meet the Press’s Chuck Todd that “everybody” commits infidelities.
Rudy would know. His first marriage, to his second-cousin Regina Peruggi, ended in divorce, and his second marriage, to Donna Hanover, ended when he conducted a high-profile affair with Judith Nathan—even going so far as providing her with security and chauffeur services courtesy of the NYPD while he was mayor (translation: taxpayers helped pay for Rudy concealing his affair).

On Friday night, the beloved comic behind Louie and Horace and Pete took on The New Yorker Festival in a 90-minute chat with television critic Emily Nussbaum. In the heart of Times Square, the writer and director unloaded on the Republican presidential candidate and the massive, greedy hole where his heart should be.
Talking in depth about Horace and Pete, C.K.’s 10-episode online tragedy, Nussbaum and C.K. naturally transitioned from discussing “perfect narcissists” onscreen to the raging egomaniac currently trampling towards the White House. According to the seasoned comedian, “People are usually bad when they’re hurting.” His lifelong desire to give disgusting people emotional depth has made C.K. into a keen observer of human behavior. When Nussbaum asked him about a specific reference in Horace and Pete to the “president-hole” that Trump is trying to fill, Louis revealed that his musings on the tax-evading real estate tycoon
“That’s where you want to meet the dude,” Louis quipped. “That’s the real Trump.”
But C.K. wasn’t kidding. Apparently, the comedian was working at a Trump casino, many years ago, when the run-in went down. While working at what was doubtlessly an
When Trump and his toupee finally made an appearance in Atlantic City, Louis was shocked to see that he just walked around, expressing absolutely no gratitude to the folks who filled his coffers. “He didn’t say ‘thank you’ to anybody, he just walked around… and when I was in the elevator with him I just looked in his face, and he was just miserable looking. And everybody was so excited to see him, and they’re giving him everything.”
At this point, C.K. came up with the theory that fueled that Horace and Pete punchline. He recalled thinking, “He has everything, right? And they’re leaving on the same bus just with nothing; they’re ruining their lives. And I saw this like as a reverse-charity…These women, these old ladies, they don’t need anything. They live in a shitty place and they have two dollars, and they’re like, ‘Eh, I don’t need it, it’s ok, he needs it!’ If he looks in the mirror, and he has ten dollars, he’s going to kill himself.” He concluded, “He has a $10 billion deficit in his heart. So if he doesn’t have that much money, he’s nothing. So they were like, ‘Donald, you take this!’ Because they’re invested in his charity.’”
After the uproarious applause died down, Louis noted, solemnly, that Trump’s insatiable love of money has somehow metastasized into a president-sized hole: “He’s like, ‘Thank you for your money, now I need control over your lives.’”
When Nussbaum followed up by comparing Trump to an insult comic and asking if Louis had any comedian’s wisdom for Hillary to take him down, he was quick to differentiate Trump’s unstudied craft from the work of seasoned professionals. According to Louis, insult comics are “good people who know how to fuck somebody up.” He described
While the beloved comic is positive that Trump will insult audience members and scandalize constituents at Sunday’s town hall debate, he quickly assured the audience that, “I’ll be watching. That’s why we’re doing this whole election: Because we’d rather watch awful shit than have good roads and have poor people not die all the time.”
As for Hillary, Louis was adamant, “I don’t think she needs any advice from anybody. She’s unbelievable.” He even said that the former Secretary of State, “Reminds me of my mom—she works hard, and then she goes, ‘All right, go ahead and talk, I’m doing this.’ So I like her.” And for the people who insist that Clinton is a liar and a crook, Louis has one, small, question: “What the fuck do you know?”",unknown,True

Later during the interview, Camerota asked Begaye what he wanted from the president after Monday’s viral “Pocahontas” incident.

Nixon is a middle-aged conservative Democrat, and here he was mixing with students trying to garner attention for themselves in their own, trollish baccalaureate ways. More than one student was holding a “Lizard People for Hillary” sign, while another American-flag-garbed student held a banner reading, “Outback Steakhouse for Trump.” (He had a second, handwritten poster: “Bloomin’ Onion now only $7.00."") Two other students standing next to each other held up color-coordinated signs that read, respectively, “Proud Muslim” and “Harambe 2016.” Music was playing, students were eating ice cream and pizza, or grabbing free Fox News T-shirts by the network’s adjacent set. And then there was the governor, wandering through it all.
Nixon added that it would be unwise for Trump to go after Bill Clinton’s affairs and Hillary Clinton’s role in aiding her husband in the cover-ups. “I think that if he does what I think a lot of people think he might do tonight—come out and try to attack somebody who used to be president, when he’s talking to somebody who’s going to be president—I think that’s a serious mistake,” he said.
So how should Hillary Clinton respond when Trump definitely does that?
“Like any woman, if they’re pushed in that direction, they need to be very clear, they need to be unambiguous, and they need to call out his behavior to the American people.”
He said it’s up to the Clinton campaign to decide whether it’s worth it for them to make an appearance in Missouri. It’s not—unless she just wants to psych out Trump.

It will be a state caught up in a landslide, the possibility of which seems much more likely than it did 72 hours ago.",unknown,False
0000672,"Well, Donald Trump Just Threatened to Throw Hillary Clinton in Jail","And another norm of American politics has been shattered.
During Sunday night’s presidential debate, Donald Trump went on a fairly standard-issue rant about Hillary Clinton’s email scandal—then added a horrifying twist, suggesting he will try to prosecute her over it if he's elected president.
Trump: If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation. There has never been so many lies, so much exception.There has never been anything like it. We will have a special prosecutor. I go out and speak and the people of this country are furious. The long time workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this with emails. You get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails and acid wash them or bleach them. An expensive process. We will get a special prosecutor and look into it. You know what, people have been—their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you have done. You should be ashamed.
Moderator: Secretary Clinton, I will let you respond.
Clinton: Everything he said is absolutely false. It would be impossible to be fact checking Donald all the time. I would never get to talk and make lives better for people. Once again, go to Hillaryclinton.com. You can fact check Trump in realtime. Last time at the first debate we had millions of people fact checking and we will have millions more fact checking. It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
Trump: Because you would be in jail.

0000676,Trump campaigning in stretch like it all depends on Florida,"PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — With the turbulent White House race scrambled in new directions, Donald Trump is campaigning with rare discipline like his presidential campaign hinges on one all-too-familiar swing state: Florida.
“‘Stay on point, Donald, stay on point,'” the Republican nominee, in Pensacola, teasingly quoted his staff as saying. “No sidetracks, Donald. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.'”
There was late action Wednesday in such unlikely arenas as Arizona and Michigan, too — and in North Carolina, where President Barack Obama tried to energize black support for Hillary Clinton. But Trump marched ahead in his third multi-day visit to the Sunshine State in recent weeks.
The Republican nominee lashed out at “Crooked Hillary” in Miami, predicting that a Clinton victory would trigger an “unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis” as federal investigators probe the former secretary of state’s email practices. But Trump did not take the bait dangled by the Clinton campaign about his treatment of women.
Conceding nothing in the state, Clinton has also been a frequent visitor. She posed for pictures and shook hands during a surprise visit to a South Florida Caribbean-American neighborhood Wednesday morning.
Both sides agree the New York businessman has virtually no chance to win the presidency without Florida’s trove of 29 electoral votes. Clinton has been ahead there in opinion polls, but Democrats acknowledge that the FBI’s renewed attention to her has helped rally reluctant Republicans behind their nominee. That’s given Trump an enthusiasm boost in Florida and across Midwestern battlegrounds long considered reliably blue territory.
“I’m definitely nervous,” said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat. “Democrats in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, if you heard it was over, if you thought those states were in the bag, don’t believe it.”
Perhaps heeding Rendell’s warning, Clinton’s team is devoting new resources to states like Michigan, which hasn’t supported a Republican presidential nominee in nearly three decades.
Former President Bill Clinton was making an unannounced appearance in Detroit Wednesday night to meet privately with black ministers, the city’s mayor and other local leaders. While Hillary Clinton had two appearances Wednesday in Republican-leaning Arizona, she planned to spend part of Friday in Detroit as well.
At the same time, a pro-Clinton super PAC was spending more than $1 million on Michigan airwaves along with at least $1 million more in Colorado, another state where Clinton has enjoyed a significant polling advantage for much of the fall.
Early voting numbers in some states suggest that her challenge stems, at least in part, from underwhelming support from African-American voters. Weak minority support could complicate her path in other states, too, including North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
Early voting in North Carolina shows a 5 percentage point drop in ballots from black voters from 2012.
Obama, the nation’s first black president, offered an urgent message to North Carolina voters on Wednesday: “The fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders.”
He also criticized Trump’s history of sexist comments and his initial reluctance to disavow white supremacists. They continue to rally behind the Republican nominee, though he rejects that support.
“If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers,” Obama said, “then you’ll tolerate that support when you’re in office.”
At the same time, Clinton allies are speaking directly to black voters in a new advertising campaign running in Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. The ad from the pro-Clinton Priorities USA shows white Trump supporters screaming at and pushing black protesters, along with Obama warning that voters would lose “everything” if Trump wins.
As the final-days scramble for votes intensifies, Florida remains perhaps the nation’s most critical swing state.
The Trump campaign knows there is no realistic path to the White House without Florida, where polls give Clinton a narrow lead. The New York businessman campaigned in three Florida cities Wednesday — Miami, Orlando and Pensacola — and will follow up with a stop in Jacksonville on Thursday.
“We don’t want to blow this,” he told rowdy supporters in Miami. “We gotta win. We gotta win big.”
While Trump has devoted perhaps his most valuable resource — his time — to Florida, Clinton has built a powerful ground game, backed by a dominant media presence, that dwarfs her opponent’s. The Democratic nominee has more than doubled Trump’s investment in Florida television ads. Overall, the state has been deluged with $125 million in general election advertising — by far the most of any state.
Clinton, unlike Trump, can also afford to lose here.
Even with national polls narrowing, the Democratic contender has many more paths to 270 electoral votes. One example: Clinton campaigned Wednesday in Arizona, a state that has voted for Republican presidential candidates all but once since 1952.

BELOIT, Wis. (AP) — Hillary Clinton could face impeachment if she is elected president because her use of a private email server as secretary of state broke the law, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said.
In an interview, Johnson told the Beloit Daily News (http://bit.ly/2eS9hcp) on Monday that Clinton “purposefully circumvented” the law. The Republican said, “this was willful concealment and destruction” involving information related to national defense.
Federal law provides anyone found to have concealed or removed such records is disqualified from holding office, Johnson said.
“I’m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,” said Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. “I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.”
The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.
Johnson is locked in a re-election battle with Democrat Russ Feingold, whom he defeated in 2010.
Johnson said he believes the initial FBI investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server was not in pursuit of truth, but instead was intended to cover up her actions. In July, FBI Director James Comey said Clinton had been careless with classified information but he declined to prosecute her.
“That was a corrupt conclusion,” Johnson said of the results of the investigation.
On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that the bureau had discovered additional emails that might be relevant to the Clinton email case.

0000678,Obama to campaign for Clinton in battleground North Carolina,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is heading back to North Carolina to help turn out the vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

It’s the first of two visits Obama has planned this week to North Carolina. It’s one of a handful of states The Associated Press rates as toss-ups in the presidential race. On Friday, the president will headline get-out-the-vote rallies for Clinton in Fayetteville and Charlotte.

0000679,FBI Director James Comey erred by bowing to the howls of the right,"The cryptic letter James Comey, the FBI director, sent to Congress on Friday looked bizarre at the time — seeming to hint at a major new Clinton scandal, but offering no substance. Given what we know now, however, it was worse than bizarre, it was outrageous. Comey apparently had no evidence suggesting any wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton; he violated long-standing rules about commenting on politically sensitive investigations close to an election; and he did so despite being warned by other officials that he was doing something terribly wrong.
So what happened? We may never know the full story, but the best guess is that Comey, like many others — media organizations, would-be nonpartisan advocacy groups, and more — let himself be bullied by the usual suspects. Working the refs — screaming about bias and unfair treatment, no matter how favorable the treatment actually is — has been a consistent, long-term political strategy on the right. And the reason it keeps happening is because it so often works.
You see this most obviously in news coverage. Reporters who find themselves shut up in pens at Donald Trump rallies while the crowd shouts abuse shouldn’t be surprised: constant accusations of liberal media bias have been a staple of Republican rhetoric for decades. And why not? The pressure has been effective.
Part of this effectiveness comes through false equivalence: news organizations, afraid of being attacked for bias, give evenhanded treatment to lies and truth. Way back in 2000 I suggested that if a Republican candidate said that the earth was flat, headlines would read, “Views differ on shape of planet.” That still happens.
The desire to get right-wing critics off one’s back may also explain why the news media keep falling for fake scandals. There’s a straight line from the Whitewater investigation — which ran for seven years, was endlessly hyped in the press, but never found any wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons — to the catastrophically bad coverage of the Clinton Foundation a couple of months ago. Remember when The Associated Press suggested scandalous undue influence based on a meeting between Hillary Clinton and a donor who just happened to be both a Nobel Prize winner and an old personal friend?
Sure enough, much of the initial coverage of the Comey letter was based not on what the letter said, which was very little, but on a false, malicious characterization of the letter by Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. You might think reporters would have learned by now not to take what people like Chaffetz say at face value. Apparently not.
Nor is it just the news media. A few years ago, during the peak of deficit-scold influence, it was striking to see the various organizations demanding deficit reduction pretend that Democrats who were willing to compromise and Republicans who insisted on slashing taxes for the wealthy were equally at fault. They even gave a “fiscal responsibility” award to Paul Ryan, whose budget proposals gave smoke and mirrors a bad name.
And as someone who still keeps a foot in the academic world, I’ve been watching pressure build on universities to hire more conservatives. Never mind the way climate denial, attacks on the theory of evolution, and all that may have pushed academics out of the GOP. The fact that relatively few conservatives teach, say, physics, is supposed to be grossly unfair. And you know some schools will start hiring less qualified people in response.
Which brings us back to Comey. It seemed obvious from the start that Clinton’s decision to follow Colin Powell’s advice and bypass State Department email was a mistake, but nothing remotely approaching a crime. But Comey was subjected to a constant barrage of demands that he prosecute her for … something. He should simply have said no. Instead, even while announcing back in July that no charges would be filed, he editorialized about her conduct — a wholly inappropriate thing to do, but probably an attempt to appease the right.
It didn’t work, of course. They just demanded more. And it looks as if he tried to buy them off by throwing them a bone just a few days before the election. Whether it will matter politically remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: he destroyed his own reputation.
The moral of the story is that appeasing the modern American right is a losing proposition. Nothing you do convinces them that you’re being fair, because fairness has nothing to do with it. The right long ago ran out of good ideas that can be sold on their own merits, so the goal now is to remove merit from the picture.
Or to put it another way, they’re trying to create bias, not end it, and weakness — the kind of weakness Comey has so spectacularly displayed — only encourages them to do more.",unknown,True
0000680,Sanders’ donors in Seattle haven’t opened wallets to Clinton,"Seattle has a new kind of 1 percenter.
Of the 24,700 city residents who contributed to Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries, just 261 — a smidgen over 1 percent — have gone on to give money to another presidential candidate.
Of that small group, nearly all have moved their donation to Hillary Clinton. Green Party candidate Jill Stein received money from just 20 ex-Sanders supporters, but that’s enough to rank second.
That data comes from
Perhaps what they found is not surprising. Sanders inspired a legion of small-time contributors, many of whom might not normally donate to a political campaign at all.
The data suggest that Seattle is indeed a “Bernie or bust” town — at least when it comes to giving money to other candidates. As I wrote back in March, we fell hard for Sanders,
Chelsea Nesvig, an academic librarian who lives on Capitol Hill, remembers her disappointment when the Vermont senator endorsed Clinton, signaling that his fight for the White House was over.
Nesvig, who made a couple of small donations to Sanders, is among the roughly 24,000 in Seattle who have not contributed to another candidate. Still, Nesvig will cast her vote for Clinton. The possibility of a Trump presidency, she feels, is too frightening.
Nesvig cautiously calls herself a Clinton supporter — “Are you a supporter if you just say you’re going to vote for her?” — but has no plans to send any money Clinton’s way.
“I feel like she’s got plenty of money,” she said. “And that’s one of the things I don’t love about her.”
But Dallas Taylor, a novelist and freelance carpenter on Capitol Hill, didn’t skip a beat moving on from Bernie to Hillary, whom he supports enthusiastically.
“I switched my ActBlue monthly donations to Hillary about a month before the convention, when it was clear that she had it,” he said.
He wasn’t terribly surprised to learn that he’s among the 1 percent: “A lot of the super hard-core Bernie people, especially in Seattle, are privileged enough not to be endangered by a Trump presidency directly,” he said.
Taylor, who calls himself a pragmatic progressive, says he never expected Sanders would win. But he felt the campaign was important in how it democratized fundraising and forced Clinton more to the left. These days, he’s trying to convince his progressive friends to get behind Clinton.
“I really believe that deep in her heart, Hillary Clinton is a progressive. But she’s also a realist. Nobody plays at that level without getting a little dirty,’ he said. “I’ve never held that against her … and people have this perception that she’s much dirtier than she is.”
He’d have a hard time convincing Susan Jacobs, a lighting designer from West Seattle. She can recite a long list of things she doesn’t like about Clinton — from her support of the fracking industry to her past position opposing gay marriage.
While she has a very low opinion of Donald Trump, Jacobs doesn’t feel Clinton is that much better. “This is our choice — Trump or Hillary? That’s absurd,” she said. “I’m going to vote for the person who most aligns with my values, and that’s Jill Stein.”
Jacob, who contributed to Sanders, hasn’t given to Stein yet. But she’s considering it.
Just eight Seattleites who gave money to Sanders have donated to Donald Trump. I managed to track one of them down.
I told him he was one of eight. “It makes me kind of interesting,” he replied.
A tech worker who lives in Belltown, he would only talk to me if his name wasn’t used, saying he was afraid of repercussions at his workplace. Though he calls his feelings about Trump “complicated,” he sent him money because “ … he is the only credible outsider at this time.”
Even so, he might vote for Gary Johnson. the Libertarian candidate, or Stein. The one thing he’s sure of is that he won’t vote for Clinton. “Hillary is part of an insider group that’s getting bigger and bigger,” he said. “And that’s a real threat.”
One caveat: The data on candidate contributions present only a partial picture. By law, contributions of $200 or more are required to have donor names and other information. Small individual donations may not be included in the data.",unknown,False
0000681,Editorial: California burns: Where’s the president?,"As raging wildfires devour the lives, homes and dreams of Californians in an unprecedented scale, one voice has been conspicuously mute through day after day of crisis: President Trump.
This is not a man who is reticent to let Americans know what is foremost on his mind. He is also someone who should have learned by now — after devastating hurricanes and the Las Vegas massacre — that Americans expect their president to step forward with empathy and resolve in moments of national trauma.
Yet Trump has offered no more than a few perfunctory words about the Wine Country fires that have left at least 40 dead, consumed thousands of structures and stretched the physical and mental mettle of the dedicated firefighters and medical professionals to the edge of exhaustion.
On Tuesday, before welcoming the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, Trump said he had spoken with Gov. Jerry Brown and that the federal government would stand with the “people of California and be there with you in this time of terrible tragedy and need.”
That’s it? No talk of visiting California? No expressions of appreciation for the first responders? No condolences for those who lost their lives, or the many more who lost their homes? No recognition or pledges of federal support for the monumental task of rebuilding the neighborhoods and business that were devoured in the fire?
Then again, how much is a Trump pledge worth, anyway? His typically rapid-fire succession of tweets this week included some that seemed to blame Puerto Rico for its post-hurricane financial crisis and a warning that “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military &amp; the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”
This is a president who views tweets as his primary means of connecting with the people, without the media filter he loathes. Dare we suggest that forcing NFL players to stand for the national anthem — to name one of his recent obsessions — is not a life-and-death situation. The fires are.
And how many times has Trump tweeted about the fires since they were whipped by winds into life-threatening force early Monday: zero.
Among the subjects that have merited a Trump tweet since then:
•Oh, that NFL anthem issue (in which he falsely characterized the commissioner’s position; Roger Goodell did not demand that players stand).
•A threat to revoke the licenses of broadcast networks that have become (in his view) too “partisan, distorted and fake” (though there is no federal licensing of broadcast networks).
•A promotion for his obsequious interview by his Fox News pal Sean Hannity.
•A false claim that the New York Times set up “Liddle Bob Corker” by recording its interview with the Republican senator from Tennessee. In fact, Corker had consented to the recording.
•Praise for a flattering new book about him.
•A false claim that the NFL is “getting massive tax breaks” while its players disrespect the flag, anthem and country. In fact, the league voluntarily relinquished its tax-exempt status two years ago.
•A boast: “Nobody could have done what I’ve done for #Puerto Rico with so little appreciation.”
•More self-congratulation: “Such a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs (of Fox Business Network) ‘We take up what may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history.’”
So how can it be that the loss of 40 human beings on American soil did not merit a single tweet? The most forgiving interpretation would be that Trump, along with the cable networks that seem to attract his laser focus and have not made this a huge story, have a case of disaster fatigue. Perhaps the problem is that he hasn’t been blasted for his underwhelming response:There is no surer way to provoke him to his phone. The most cynical speculation would be that he could not care less about a state that despises him like no other.

0000682,We are all antifa,"Last month, thousands gathered in San Francisco and Berkeley to defeat the hatred of fascism and white supremacy. A united front of labor, clergy, students, socialists, anarchists and others successfully prevented the fascists from holding their rallies.
This is antifa — a broad movement of people who stand against the violence of white supremacists and fascists, violence emboldened by the ascendancy of Donald Trump to the presidency.
Despite our victory, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin called for antifa to be classified as a criminal gang. The lesson here is that we cannot depend on the government to meaningfully intervene and prevent the rise of fascism. That is up to us.
The National Lawyers Guild, an organization of thousands of lawyers, law students and legal workers across the country, has supported free speech and assembly for all progressive and radical movements for 80 years. But The Chronicle’s coverage of the Aug. 27 rally would have you believe that it is the “alt-right” that seeks to protect speech. This couldn’t be further from the truth.
Here are some examples of what the far right does when no one is filming:
•Our volunteer attorneys, legal workers and clients have received death threats and their personal information publicized to promote harassment, as a result of our defense of antifa activists;
•One attorney was stalked inside the courthouse by a man with a swastika tattoo and a shaved head wearing quasi-military-type attire. He then left, and shortly thereafter she received threatening messages and had to seek protection at a safe house;
•A group of men wearing military-like attire, and one with a swastika tattoo, was seen waiting outside Santa Rita Jail for arrestees to be released;
•National Lawyers Guild phone lines have been inundated with hate calls.
But we are prepared to defend ourselves, and are implementing security plans to ensure the safety of our members, allies and partners. This is hatred and violence, not speech.
As an antiracist organization, we refuse to support white supremacists. That does not mean that we oppose free speech.
We believe far-right extremists have successfully twisted the right to free speech to cast themselves as victims of exactly what they strive to promote — hate and violence.
The far right, however, is not the only problem. The government appears to be colluding with the far right to target antifa. Of six protesters held overnight in jail, only one has been charged with a crime — a woman with a service dog who was brutally pinned to the ground by police, allegedly for throwing an apple. Another was arrested for allegedly pulling their T-shirt over part of their face when photographed by fascists.
This campaign to recast antifa as a violent, leftist suppression of speech is a dangerous effort eerily reminiscent of the left-baiting that accompanied the Nazi rise to power.
The National Lawyers Guild won’t stand by as fascists and white supremacists seek to take power in the streets and halls of government. We stand in solidarity with all who fight hatred. We will continue to show up, to defend activists who challenge fascism, and we call on all people of conscience to do the same.

According to Richmond police in a Facebook post Monday, officers responded to the North Richmond area around 6:30 p.m. on July 17 on a report of a possible wanted person.
When officers arrived and detained the suspect, he allegedly gave a false name. When the suspect learned there was an arrest warrant for that person, he gave officers his real name, police said.
Officers learned he also had a warrant out for his arrest and he was taken into custody, police said. At the Richmond Police Department, officers learned the suspect was also on parole.
According to police, the suspect allegedly became uncooperative and combative with officers during the booking process. As a result, police decided to drive him to the county jail in Martinez.
While in the back seat of a police car, the suspect allegedly slipped his cuffed hands from behind him to his front. He then removed his clothing and dropped them through a window and onto the highway.
The suspect then allegedly defecated and began to eat his feces, which he then spat at the officers, police said.
The officers immediately pulled the vehicle over on Interstate Highway 80 and called for assistance. Additional officers arrived to help place the suspect into a compliance safety device, police said.

As a former debater myself, I did feel like there is one useful area of focus for Clinton that hasn’t been adequately covered by the media: She will be debating an asshole. There has been much rumination on how challenging it will be for her to debate someone who has no policy positions, and doesn’t know stuff. We worry about the double standard around her clothes

The one thing we all need to see, I believe, is that there is even an adult menu available, not just the chicken fingers and the grilled cheese. We need to see absolute sobriety and seriousness, and any effort to engage with the orange whirlwind of self-regard will only be a distraction.
Hillary needs to imagine herself back in Victorian England when children were still largely ignored—even if they were wearing miniaturized adult clothing.
That brings us to the baskets. The fact that the racists, misogynists, and bigots have not just come out of the woodwork to support Trump but have indeed become his reinforced load-bearing walls is apparently
So here’s the great news: Everything Clinton needs to do involve skills she has in spades. She is an adult. She is an expert. She can talk about policy in frightening detail. She isn’t an entertainer, or a pastor, or a porn star. That’s all to the good. There is no doubt whatsoever that anyone tuning in Monday to be amused, or cuddled, or fake-understood, will find her robotic and probably even cold. People, as it turns out, really like porn stars.
But anyone who wants to see, for the first time since the primaries, how fully realized adult humans speak, think, and behave, will want to see that Clinton, the one
Whatever party they may prefer, Americans are terrified right now. They are terrified of violence, and racial strife, and ISIS, and—I’d suspect—most Americans are terrified of what this race has done to presidential elections. Steadiness and sanity may not make for great reality television. But the other alternative does not make for very great reality.
Hillary Clinton was probably born an earnest, sober middle-aged woman. Donald Trump was born a toddler and doesn’t appear to have moved up much along the developmental charts. She needs to have the confidence to understand that Americans are able and willing to reckon with the difference between the two.",unknown,True

For months now, Hillary Clinton has occasionally been using some version of this Maya Angelou quote when she discusses Donald Trump on the campaign trail: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” This is usually followed by some variation on another line Clinton used at the Democratic National Convention in July: “There is no other Donald Trump. This is it.”
After months of controversies over Trump’s personal attacks on women, his racist talk about an American judge of Mexican heritage, his casual slurs of immigrants and a Muslim American Gold Star family, and countless other controversies, it seemed as though the folks who were determined to back Trump saw and understood perfectly well who he was and had accepted it. More maddening, it seemed
That’s why, when the story broke on Friday that Donald Trump was caught on a live mic bragging about how he could kiss women—and grab their genitals—without their consent because he was famous, I initially wondered what the news was. Was there anyone alive surprised here? Voters have watched Trump joyfully trash and objectify women for more than a year. Republicans and their leaders have been offered evidence of Trump as an unrepentant pig since the primaries began.
His supporters have tolerated his rampant sexism, xenophobia, threats of violence and lawlessness, and so much more. So why should talk of grabbing a woman’s pussy with impunity become the straw that broke the camel’s back? As Clinton has suggested, often with great frustration, Trump has been showing us who he really is for months, if not years.
Here’s the reason it really did become the last straw, why so many Republican politicians who had previously supported Trump are now either renouncing their support or calling for him to drop out (by Saturday afternoon it was
The groping tape is different, it reveals both the real Trump and the performer Trump, and it turns out the former is actually scarier than the latter.
Partly it’s because we clearly hear a new version of Trump’s voice on the tape. Yes, his standard swaggering tone—so incredibly familiar at this point—is present. But in this tape he’s not bragging at us in a way he wants us to hear. It’s startling because it’s both perfectly recognizable and perfectly novel in its utter grotesqueness. Partly it’s the coarseness, the glowing pride he takes in acts of sexual violence, that makes this feel different from even the worst comments he has made in the past. But the real reason Trump’s “pussy” comments may prove to be the death knell for the nominee—and have led so many in his own party to abandon him already—is that it definitively proves the truth about the things Trump says: Contrary to his
What changed with Friday’s video revelation is that Trump has been caught in the perfect duality of a born performer: On the bus with Billy Bush, he’s the braggart, the player, the one who cares only about tits and his score sheet—
It’s not just,
The reason the video may prove to be the last gasp for Donald Trump’s campaign is that it inverts the story he’s been telling us all along: that the sexism, the skirt-chasing, the jolly recreational objectification of young girls and women is just a persona he affects for the cameras. Now we are offered incontrovertible proof of the truth we could never force his supporters to acknowledge: The monstrous woman-hater is actually the person under the performer.
The stark contrast between the story he’s been selling about which part of his life was staged and which part is real is finally revealed. Even for those who have suspected it all along, the fact that Trump hasn’t been just playing a pig, but actually is one, is shocking to hear and see. For those who would deny that reality, this tape makes the task of defending him all but impossible. Anyone who stands with the real Trump now—the Trump who thinks that furniture is foreplay and that women are basically just furniture—will never be able to hide from that fact again.

“Their children.” “The second generation.” Trump wasn’t just arguing, as he had in the past, that the refugees couldn’t be vetted. He was claiming that even if they were vetted, they still had to be kept out of the country, because their offspring might someday become terrorists. This scenario would take place in the future, possibly involving children who were not yet born and influences from abroad that might reach these children without their parents’ knowledge. Therefore, no migrant, regardless of vetting, was safe to admit.
Now Trump was talking about a third generation. If the children of migrants didn’t become terrorists, their grandchildren might. And even if none of them did, Muslims were still too dangerous to allow into the country, because they or their descendants might try to tell non-Muslim kids “how wonderful Islam is.”
Trump conceded that the killer in Orlando, like the male shooter in San Bernardino, had been born in the United States. But he emphasized that their parents, respectively, were from Afghanistan and Pakistan. He also pointed to the Boston Marathon bombers, whose parents had come from Central Asia. He used these cases to justify a ban not only on Afghans and Pakistanis, but on refugees from Syria, who had committed none of these crimes. In a

Donald Trump says the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida—perpetrated early Sunday morning by an
Trump is a fool. Analysts who see this atrocity as an act of radical Islamic terrorism—and who understand radicalism, Islam, and terrorism far better than Trump does—suspect it was inspired by a
The statement from ISIS, released on May 21, exhorts Muslims to “terrorize” non-Muslims everywhere and to make Ramadan “a month of suffering.” But this plea comes from a position of weakness. The statement says “the whole world has allied and rushed against us,” launching “20,000 airstrikes” and killing several top ISIS leaders. It pledges, defiantly and expectantly, that ISIS won’t quit no matter how much territory it loses.
The worst peril, according to the statement, is emerging from within Islam: “Evil scholars” are using “every form of media” to issue “fatwas against the mujahidin.” These scholars, the statement explains, are promoting moderate interpretations of Islamic mercy. They’re denouncing terrorism and condemning ISIS fighters as pseudo-Islamic “renegades.” They’re instructing Muslims to renounce jihad and expel ISIS from their lands. For pages and pages, the statement goes on, lambasting these scholars and the damage they’re doing to public opinion. Clearly, ISIS sees this as a central threat.
To quash the threat, ISIS reasserts that “there are only two armies, two camps, two trenches”: Muslims and infidels. There can be no integration, the statement argues—no attempt to “ ‘make peace and mix’ with those who hate the faith.” Muslims must follow ISIS: “We are the People of the Quran.” The statement claims that the armies arrayed against ISIS “wage war against us … because we command the worship of Allah. … This is our religion. For this alone, we fight the world and they fight us.”
To prove that the forces arrayed against ISIS are anti-Islamic, and to justify terrorism in Europe and the United States, the statement presents three arguments. First, it says the West doesn’t care about the thousands of Syrian Muslims slaughtered by Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Contrary to our rhetoric about human rights, we’ve ignored Assad’s:
Second, the statement accuses us of indifference to Syrians who have fled their homes. “The sentiments in Europe, America, and other disbelieving nations are not moved nor shaken by the displacement of millions,” ISIS argues. “They are not disturbed by the hunger, disease, suffering, and death of thousands of helpless and besieged children, women, and elderly people.”
Third, ISIS says it’s OK to kill civilians in non-Muslim countries, because that’s what we do in Muslim countries. The statement instructs ISIS sympathizers abroad:
On each of these three points, Trump’s rhetoric and agenda support ISIS. Trump
Trump also reinforces ISIS’s message that the campaign against it is a war against Islam. His ban on entry to the United States would apply to
In short, Trump would undercut everything that’s working against ISIS: Muslim governments that have joined our military campaign, clerics who are articulating moderate Islam, ministries and activists who are working online to discredit jihadism. He would help ISIS obtain the weapons it needs most: overseas recruits who are willing to kill people in their own countries. He would make another Orlando more likely.

0000689,The Most Damning Speech of the GOP Convention,"Photo by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images
The 2016 Republican National Convention is a marvel of cognitive dissonance. It seems to have been constructed as though Republicans were nominating a normal presidential candidate. But they aren’t. We keep hearing that the nominee stands for this or has said that—but he doesn’t, and he hasn’t. He’s outside the bounds of presentable behavior. So the party, in its presentation, ignores his record.
Take Monday’s speech by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Like previous speakers, he complained that President Obama has failed to identify “our enemy.” Giuliani described this enemy as “Islamic extremist terrorism.” Then he paused to lecture reporters: “For the purpose of the media, I did not say all of Islam. I did not say most of Islam. I said Islamic extremist terrorism.”
Well, that’s nice. But it’s not
“Donald Trump is a leader,” Giuliani went on. “He will reassert America’s position as the nation with the best values to lead the world.”
Really? Trump will show we have the best values to lead the world? Maybe a Republican speaker could have said that about George W. Bush, who at least claimed to fight for democracy. But Trump? Trump’s whole foreign policy is about renouncing values. He says
Giuliani accused Obama of dividing the country over police shootings. He asked: “What happened to ‘There's no black America, no white America, there is just America’?” Speaking for the GOP, Giuliani pledged: “We reach out our arms with understanding and compassion to those who have lost loved ones because of police shootings.”

Shortly before the Republican National Convention, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he had spoken with Donald Trump
Nearly two weeks after the convention ended, it’s clear that Trump is unreformed. It’s not just his beef with the parents of a slain soldier: Trump has spurned the Constitution, ridiculed morality, and dished out ethnic, religious, and sexual slurs. As these outbursts have continued, Ryan has spoken out just once, ignoring the rest of Trump’s offenses. He and other Republican leaders continue to support Trump. Here’s what Trump has said and done since the convention while the GOP leadership, for the most part, has looked the other way.

5. Using war to steal wealth.

They can chop off heads, they can drown people, they can bury you in sand. And we can’t waterboard. … It’s very hard when you’re not playing on a level playing field, folks.”

0000691,What Black People Hear When Donald Trump Asks for Their Vote,"Timothy A. Clary/Getty Images
To the extent that Donald Trump is reaching out to black Americans, his pitch relies on a bleak vision of black life in the United States and an attack on Democratic Party leadership in those same cities. “Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on,”
So far, there is no groundswell of black enthusiasm for Trump. He wins 8 percent of black voters in the
In a sign of confidence, however,
That fact—black indifference or even antipathy to Trump and his rhetoric—deserves a little more attention. It’s not that black voters are hostile to Trump; it’s that they won’t even entertain his basic message. There’s nothing he could say or do in the realm of possibility that would budge his numbers away from historic lows, much less restore them to the double digits enjoyed by George W. Bush in
The simple answer is that it’s patronizing, ahistorical nonsense that’s not at all unique to Trump. The problem goes beyond the mere optics of his “outreach”—producing dystopian portraits of black life for predominantly white audiences. And it’s not just the extent to which Trump is talking about black Americans rather than to them. The central issue is that Trump portrays black Americans not as able citizens who need to be convinced, but as mindless followers of a failed regime.
“The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty,” Trump said in a
In this narrative, black Americans are mere objects—means to a partisan end. They do not choose or act as political agents. There are no black politicians or activists or leaders of any stripe. Instead, they are acted upon, tools of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. And worse, despite the horrors of Democratic governance, they don’t understand that they’ve been used and “betrayed.” They still vote for Democrats in overwhelming numbers. They are dupes.
Trump’s argument isn’t new. It is de rigueur among conservative personalities to blame the Republican Party’s poor performance with black voters on a “plantation mentality,” in which blacks are kept hopelessly dependent on government benefits and the Democratic Party that peddles them. The goal: to keep black Americans from grasping the truth that prosperity comes from “liberty” and free markets. You can hear this perspective throughout right-wing media, from
Key to the “plantation” theory is the idea that modern Democrats are direct heirs to the white supremacist Democratic Party of the 19th and early 20th centuries. For proponents, it is a straight line from John C. Calhoun to Jefferson Davis to Theodore Bilbo to Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. You hear this in Trump’s rhetoric as well. “We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton,” he
These narratives and arguments are bizarre to the point of incoherence, a fourth-rate imitation of history, devoid of any actual meaning. Shaped, influenced, and even driven by black Americans in the middle of the 20th century, the modern Democratic Party is not the literal descendant of the white supremacist party that bore the name for a century; in much of the modern-day South, black Americans are the Democratic Party. Black Americans have had an active role in Democratic Party politics for two generations, culminating in the election of Barack Obama, a black American. More broadly, blacks have not been led astray—they are not victims of false consciousness or some “plantation mentality.” They are political actors making choices based on their interests as they see them.
Likewise, the issues in urban America aren’t the product of the Democratic Party or the black mayors and city councilors who took the reins of the cities in the 1970s and 1980s. The decline of Detroit or Cleveland or Baltimore didn’t begin in 1967. Instead, they’re the cumulative result of a century of policies, from redlining and housing discrimination to white flight, federal neglect, and ongoing hostility from surrounding municipalities. There’s no question that these cities have been marred by bad governance, but to understand that in terms of party affiliation—neglecting the effects of deindustrialization, racism, and capital flight—is to show profound ignorance of urban politics and problems.
Blacks are not victims of false consciousness or some “plantation mentality.” They are political actors making choices based on their interests as they see them.
Beyond incoherent, the ideas underlying Trump’s narrative are racist, full stop. If “plantation” theory is true, then black voters are the mindless drones of American politics. Nefarious Democrats gave them a taste of government, and they never abandoned the hand that fed them. White voters, by contrast, are active citizens—noble republicans in the best tradition of the founders. It’s ironic: For as much as they disdain Democrats as the real racists, it’s the proponents of plantation theory who
What’s key is that black voters hear this sentiment in the rhetoric used by Trump and other conservatives. It’s one reason that, despite having been peddled in its current incarnation by black conservatives and their allies for the better part of a decade, the argument has never gotten any traction.
The other reason is Barack Obama. Tens of millions of black Americans hold the president and his family in high esteem as exemplars of the black community. For them, he deserves respect regardless of your politics. And if there’s anything that defines the GOP in the present age for black voters, it’s the outsized disrespect for Obama, from South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson’s “
Somewhere in the multiverse is a world where black voters have warmed to Donald Trump. It’s not this one. In this world, for blacks to reconsider Trump and the Republican Party, they would have to ignore his birtherism; they would have to ignore the push for voter ID and the attacks on civil rights legislation; they would have to downplay the patronizing “outreach” of conservative voices and Republican politicians. For blacks to reconsider Trump, they would have to act as if they were the dupes of his imagination.",unknown,True

Keep in mind that this comes from a candidate who began his campaigns suggesting that some number of Mexican immigrants were “rapists,” whose signature policies are a wall on the Mexican border and a ban on Muslim immigration, and whose “

ST. LOUIS—The most important part of Sunday night’s presidential debate happened within the first 20 minutes. The rest wasn’t uninteresting—at one point, Donald Trump
The honor goes to the first major moment of the debate. That’s where, after a lengthy exchange, a menacing and almost unhinged Trump threatened to put Clinton in prison should he win the White House in November. Even in a campaign in which Republican crowds chant “lock her up” and Trump surrogates play-act anti-Clinton tribunals, it was extraordinary and disturbing. The behavior of a despot, not of a president.
The ramp-up to this was revelatory. Trump was cornered, and he responded with a burst of banana-republic machismo, vowing to investigate and prosecute a political opponent using the powers of his office. It was a remarkable moment: a presidential nominee promising to rip up the foundations of liberal democracy for the sake of getting off a good attack line.
It began with the first question. One of the two moderators, CNN’s Anderson Cooper, asked Trump to account for the now-infamous tape in which the Republican nominee claims to “grab” women “by the pussy,” bragging about sexual assault. Trump called it “locker room talk” and tried to pivot to ISIS. Cooper stopped him and pressed him on the question, which he tried to avoid. Trump returned to his campaign slogan—“We’re going to make America great again”—and Cooper turned the question over to Clinton, who hit one of her themes.
“Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander in chief,” said Clinton, before rattling off the laundry list of groups that Trump has attacked and insulted over the course of the campaign. He responded—“It’s just words, folks. Just words.”—and the moderators brought the debate back to audience questions, including one submitted online. This one also focused on the tape. “When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man, or did that behavior continue until just recently?” Again, Trump called this “locker room talk.” But then he went in a different direction, one presaged by both his Friday night apology video and an
“There’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women,” said Trump of the former president. “You can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.” He continued, tying Hillary to her husband’s history with women. “Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.”
Clinton had a chance to respond, and she did, again reciting Trump’s attacks on a variety of groups and individuals, from the Khan family—whose son died fighting in Iraq—and Judge Gonzalo Curiel, to President Obama, whom Trump repeatedly attacked as illegitimate on the basis of his birth.
It’s at this juncture that the Republican nominee—already teetering on the edge of decorum—went off the rails. He accused Clinton of starting the “birther” conspiracy; he questioned her friendship with Michelle Obama; he accused Clinton of rigging the Democratic primary to rob Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders of the election; and he slammed her for her emails, all leading to an explosion of contempt and menace.
“If I win,” said Trump, “I’m going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there’s never been so many lies, so much deception.” He continued: “[W]e’re going to get a special prosecutor because people have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you’ve done.” And when Clinton gave her response—“It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law of our country”—Trump jumped in with a quip.
“Because you’d be in jail.”
There’s no charitable read here, or at least not one that respects the rules and structure of the English language. Trump’s meaning is plain. Should he win the Oval Office, he will use his authority vis-à-vis the Justice Department to launch an investigation of his rival in the presidential election. And because he believes Clinton uniquely perfidious, this investigation would lead to her prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment. As he said, she would be in jail.
Historians, commentators, and “Never Trump” Republicans quickly grasped the weight of his statement. “Only time I’ve ever heard a candidate threatening to jail his opponent was in the Congo. He lost &amp; was later convicted of war crimes,”
She’s right. The United States is not a perfect democracy. But one thing we can say is that, in America, political opponents are just that: political opponents. They aren’t hounded and they aren’t imprisoned. It isn’t a crime to be on the other side of an election. To go down that road is to take a shortcut to despotism and repression.
On Sunday, to an audience of tens of millions of Americans, Trump voiced his contempt for the norms that define and safeguard our democracy with a promise to jail his chief political opponent. This, again, was the most important moment of the debate. Nothing else—not Clinton’s poor answers for her private speeches, nor Trump’s abject ignorance—comes close. And it’s all the more important given Trump’s larger platform. If elected, the Republican would use the force of the state against nonwhites and religious minorities, from forced deportations of unauthorized Hispanic immigrants to surveillance of Muslim Americans and a return to
In all of this, it’s worth noting the complicity of the GOP leadership. An hour after Trump promised to jail his opponent if elected president, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus praised his nominee’s performance. “Hillary Clinton spent the night struggling to defender her failed record,”

In a normal presidential election, debates are a chance to compare two plausible candidates. This isn’t a normal election. If you chatter about who won or lost on points, you’re missing the story. The story in these debates is that the public is getting a chance to see, before it happens, what it would be like to have Donald Trump as president. It would be one of the most dangerous crises in the history of the United States.
The first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on Sept. 26, exposed Trump’s views on
The
The debate opened with a question about role-modeling. CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump about the recently disclosed 2005 video in which Trump bragged about using his star power to grope women. “You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals,” said Cooper. “That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?”
Trump dismissed his taped comments as “locker-room talk.” Then, without missing a beat, he continued:
Why did Trump answer a question about sexual assault by pledging to block refugees and knock the hell out of ISIS? Because to him, it’s all about power. He’s proud of the macho image in the tape, even if he regrets that his language was graphic enough to hurt him politically. The guy who talks big in the locker room is the guy we can count on to break some heads.
Half an hour later, a Muslim woman asked the candidates, “How will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country?” Trump answered her by repeating his slander that “in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment” of the terrorists before they struck last December. This claim has been
Nor did Trump renounce his proposal to
Trump called for more military collaboration with Russia (whose invasion of Ukraine he has previously
Raddatz noted that Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, “said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.” Pence’s statement was conservative orthodoxy, but Trump rejected it. “I disagree,” said Trump. Presented with a choice between Russian and anti-Russian foreign policy, Trump chose Russia. Vladimir Putin is Trump’s spiritual running mate.
Trump doesn’t just admire Putin. He emulates him. Like Putin, Trump
One of Putin’s goals in hacking U.S. government websites is to discredit our electoral process. He would like to destabilize American democracy. Trump has aided this project by warning that the election is “
“If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,” Trump told Clinton. Twice more, he repeated the threat: “We’re going to have a special prosecutor.” Clinton, marveling at this outburst, expressed relief “that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.” To which Trump retorted: “Because you’d be in jail.”
These are norms we don’t openly trash in the United States in the 21st century. We don’t settle political disputes by jailing opponents. We don’t dismiss election results and promote political violence. We don’t serve and emulate dictators. We don’t suspend the civil liberties of minorities. We don’t worship men who abuse women and brag about it. Occasionally, we’ve crossed some of these lines. But no major-party presidential nominee has so baldly renounced them.

0000695,"Trump’s Fearmongering, Hate-Filled Speech on Orlando Is the Scariest Thing He’s Done Yet","Every time a mass shooting occurs in the United States, commentators note how scary it is that we’ve almost become numb to them. But the past year has proven that we also risk becoming numb to another grave threat to America and the world: Donald Trump. His behavior in the past 36 hours has been so horrifically grotesque in so many different ways that it is easy to become emotionally immune to his hideous and bigoted comments, and the soullessness of his response to tragedy.
But we shouldn’t become immune: Trump’s response to the Orlando attack is a frightening window into how he might govern if elected. And his speech on Monday afternoon was the most terrifying of the campaign.
The fact that it was more of the same—demagoguery, fearmongering, outright lies—shouldn’t blind us to its disgusting content. Seemingly of the belief that simply saying “radical Islam” will win the war on terror (in this, at least, he doesn’t depart from the party he now leads), Trump mouthed the phrase many times Monday afternoon. But he also mouthed many other phrases, each one more disturbing than the next. He accused the president of consciously keeping law enforcement from doing its job; he scolded Hillary Clinton for saying Muslims were peaceful; he claimed he was right to call for a Muslim ban; he talked of huddling with the NRA to help prevent attacks. He talked of “these people”; he implied that almost all Afghans were extremists; he lied about the place of birth of the alleged shooter, who was American-born. “Can you imagine what they will do in large groups?” Trump asked, saying Obama had tried to bring “large groups” of Muslims from abroad. He claimed that immigrants would constitute a Trojan horse, implying that Muslims coming here were part of some secret plan.
He’s been saying this nonsense since Sunday morning. On Fox News, he
The lowest moment of the lowest speech in this very low campaign came near the end, when Trump, noting that Muslims must talk to authorities about their neighbors, said, “The Muslim community, so importantly, they have to work with us. They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad. And they know it. And they have to do it forthwith.” It was all there: the “us” that doesn’t include Muslim-Americans, the not-so-vague menace behind the warning, the claim about what “they” know.

Trump responded to the question with the laughable explanation his campaign decided to go with in the end: that it was Hillary Clinton who started the rumor, that they both spent years ardently searching for President Obama's birth certificate, and only he could successfully pressure its release. This is a lie because a) Hillary Clinton did not start birtherism, and b) there was no mainstream interest in getting Obama to produce the long-form birth certificate, because it was a ridiculous fringe theory.

0000698,The Bizarre Political Logic That Leads Conservative Pundits to Downplay a Hurricane,"Bill Pugliano/Getty Images
One of the stranger and more troubling political developments of the past 15 years has been the conservative response to scientists' warnings of potentially catastrophic climate change. If climate change is real, to address it would probably require government intervention in industry. And conservatives are opposed to that. Therefore, climate change must not be real! The scientists are all lying.
And if the scientists are the sort of people who would lie to us about the climate, what else might they be lying about? Hurricanes, for one thing.
So goes the logic, if I may use the term loosely, of the influential conservative blogger Matt Drudge. On Thursday, as Hurricane Matthew approached the Florida coast with 130mph winds—so the scientists claim, at any rate!—Drudge spied an opportunity to plant his flag and catch out those nefarious forecasters and their politically motivated hurricane models. Here is what he decided would be
Lest anyone get the mistaken impression that this was pure, shameless, and dangerously uninformed speculation on Drudge's part, he followed this up by lodging some
Why would they do all that? What climate agenda would be served by government scientists triggering a mass evacuation for a storm that turns out to be illusory? Drudge does not deign to clarify. We're left to imagine a liberal conspiracy so farsighted that it encompasses entire fields of science and multiple arms of government, yet so nearsighted that it doesn't realize it would lose rather than gain credibility by making false predictions that will be proven wrong the moment the storm passes harmlessly by.
Lest you think these are the delusional ramblings of a lone wingnut, my colleague Ben Mathis-Lilley points out that
Interestingly, Limbaugh winds up by acknowledging that Hurricane Matthew is a “serious bad storm,” perhaps to insulate himself from the angry recriminations if the damage is severe. Drudge seems to have missed that memo.
Is it possible that it's actually Drudge and Limbaugh, and not the National Weather Service, who are misleading the public about natural disasters in order to score some cheap political points? Ah, but to believe that would require trusting professional scientists over conservative pundits to tell us the truth about science. And that in turn would suggest that perhaps we should do the same when it comes to climate science—which would then raise the specter once again of having to actually do something about it, perhaps via government intervention in industry.

0000699,When Powerful Men Play the Victim,"LONDON — During the
In reality,
And despite being among the richest men in America, born to wealth in the most powerful country in the world, Trump’s message of victimhood is resonating.
You may be forgiven for pondering aloud here… WTF? And… does he believe this stuff himself?
I think he does.
Power is one of life’s most addictive drugs, and we need to consider the withdrawal symptoms of this intoxicant among Trump supporters.
When the powerful are being leveled, they become scared. Petrified of losing the deference they believe they are entitled to, they cast themselves anew as the oppressed. Used to receiving preferential treatment, they suddenly feel discriminated against.
And so it has come to pass that every time a powerful group is equalized during times of great social upheaval, they cast themselves as
They feel threatened, then discriminated against, and they may grow dangerous. The years after the Great War witnessed Germans and Italians bemoaning their loss of status, which led to World War II. Many in the American South felt victimized and probably scared, when Lincoln ended slavery. Some responded with the Ku Klux Klan, then Jim Crow.
Misogynist men felt threatened and vulnerable when women demanded universal suffrage. And Islamism emerged after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, as Arabs and Muslims were hit by a post-colonial identity crisis, no longer being able to chart the course of the world as they knew it.
How is it that Trump, one of the most powerful men in America, can see himself as the victim? Easily. Here is a man so used to acting with impunity that even after the Central Park Five were
Here is somebody so used to not being held to account that he felt free to boast about
Here is a relic of power so accustomed to getting what he wants that he doesn’t even let facts stand in his way (Note: Facts are only for Mexicans). And therefore, when he’s finally expected to account for his actions, to justify his assertions and defend his positions, he complains about being victimized.
Trump is the archetypal cry-bully, so adjusted to everything revolving around him that only he can be the victim. Nobody else’s pain matters, unless of course it can be used to teach them how much he has been suffering, too.
Originating in the 16th century, the word “bully” was

Yes, while the people of Puerto Rico are starving, drinking water from creeks, have no electricity, and are struggling to get basic medical help, the president is essentially calling them “ungrateful” while he strolls around a golf course in New Jersey that bears his name.
It is sickening that this president is tweeting insults to the people he should be bending over backward to help. But as has been made clear over and over again, the president is unable to tolerate any kind of criticism. Instead of saying, “I’m sorry,” or, “I’m trying,” or, “I’ll work on that,” he says, in the manner of a three-year-old, “No, you are.”
Phrases like, “not able to get their workers to help” and “want everything to be done for them” are direct references to racist stereotypes. He knows that his base will nod their heads in agreement while they hang their confederate flags next to their American flags, and that’s all he cares about.

Trump’s case would be similarly disastrous, and his lawyers surely know it. The threats of litigation are pure hot air.
First, Trump has no case against the Times – or against the Palm Beach Post, which he has also threatened. The
The legal term for that claim is “bullshit.”
As a public figure, Trump would have to prove that the newspapers acted with “actual malice,” i.e., the deliberate intention of harming Trump’s reputation. While Trump makes this accusation all the time in the press, making it in court is a different story. Absent some kind of bizarre smoking gun – an email from a Times editor, for example, saying “we gotta get Trump” – it’s impossible that a court would believe that the newspaper is pursuing a vendetta against Trump, as opposed to reporting on a hot story about a presidential candidate.
Even if the accusers’ stories turn out to be false, the Times wouldn’t be guilty of defamation. Like all careful news outlets, the
The only shred of a legal claim in the Trump lawyers’ letter is that the Times did not adequately “test the veracity of these false and malicious allegations, including why these two individuals waited” to make them – 11 years and 30 years, respectively. That’s a claim so false as to be delusional. The third paragraph of the Times piece clearly explains that Jessica Leeds, one of the accusers, was provoked by Trump’s claim, in the second presidential debate, that he had never actually groped anyone.
Nor is the Times likely to be intimidated by the prospect of a Trump lawsuit. They have their own lawyers, who surely reviewed the piece before it went out, and they know the law. Some have speculated that smaller news outlets may indeed be intimidated by such threats, but this type of exposure isn’t like the Hulk Hogan tape that sunk Gawker. Any properly-vetted, reasonably sourced accusations are safe; they are about a public figure and germane to a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Indeed, though Trump has alleged politics is behind the Times piece, surely his lawyers’ threatening letter is, itself, political theater. And now the Times responded in kind, making the politically incendiary claim that since Trump has already bragged about abusing women, his reputation can't be harmed by the story. This is not a good legal defense, which the Times lawyers know; it is basically saying ""we dare you to sue us.""
Trump could have a stronger case against the women themselves – but, like Cosby before him, Trump would get a lot more than he bargained for.
To prove defamation, the statement in question must be false, harmful, and public. These statements obviously fulfill the second and third requirements – but what about the first?
Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that ultimately, the question of truth will come down to he said/she said. Doubtless, Trump’s lawyers will do their best to paint these accusers – and the many others who have already come forward – as opportunists, or sluts, or liars, or worse. They will argue that these incidents never happened, and that the women defamed Mr. Trump by saying that they did.
That will be a nasty process, to be sure, but the women won’t be on their own. Well-known attorney Gloria Allred, who has represented dozens of women in sexual harassment cases over the years, has already been in contact with several of the women involved. And while she did not comment on individual cases, Allred told The Daily Beast:
“Mr. Trump's threat to sue the New York Times is outrageous. What about freedom of the press? Did Mr. Trump forget about the First Amendment or does he only talk about the amendments that he likes? He is trying to shut down a free press in this country and every citizen should speak out and protest that.”
Meanwhile, if Trump sues, every single thing Trump has ever said about women, from the Access Hollywood video to the Howard Stern tapes, would be admissible as evidence. Just what we’ve seen so far is quite damning. If it’s a case of he said/she said – well, he boasted to Billy Bush that he kisses women non-consensually and “grabs them by the pussy” all the time.
Worse still for Trump, the accusers would, as part of the discovery process, likely be able to obtain tapes that we haven’t even seen yet – first and foremost, those rumored tapes from the Apprentice series that include Trump using racial slurs. All of these would enter the public record.
Oh, and there’s more. As with the Cosby case, every single woman that Trump has kissed since his clubbing days at Studio 54 would now be a potential character witness. These women may be barred from filing their own claims of sexual assault, either by statutes of limitations or by high evidentiary standards, but they’ll be quite free to testify to any encounters they’ve had with Trump.
In sum, while Trump could harass these women and cost them some money, everything he’s ever said about or done to women will come to light. And as we

Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, who is now polling above 20 percent in Utah, had to put out a statement Saturday denying that he took $12,000 from the Clinton Foundation. “I have no relationship to the Clinton Foundation. I oppose both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,”
McMullin’s campaign even had to put up a section on his official website to denounce the printout, on which McMullin called “
“Sharia Law? Glenn Beck? Bill Ayers? Black Lives Matter? ACORN? Public Polling?”
Chris, who goes by MassRafTer on Twitter, has been duping Trump supporters with intentionally impossible-to-believe fake leaked documents for a few months now.

“Your latest poll is unacceptable. We aren’t paying you $760,000 per month to show a FIVE POINT LEAD. Are you trying to make Trump win?” it reads. “We will be ending our contract with your company unless results improve quickly.”
The stunt landed the fake memo on far-right message boards and merited a mocking two-minute segment on MSNBC’s All In With Chris Hayes. Even Donald Trump Jr. retweeted it—before later deleting it.
Turns out Chris was a pioneer.
“The first one was made to be as fake looking as possible just to see if people would buy it. Now 90 percent unbelievable would be a good number,” Chris said. “So I made the new one a greatest hits of Obama and Clinton conspiracies with stuff like Larry Sinclair to make it extra obvious.”
Sinclair is, according to a fabricated right-wing conspiracy theory, Barack Obama’s gay lover and drug peddler from the ’90s. Still, thousands of people—and counting—bought Chris’s fake posts.

@OMFG_America later deleted the tweet, plus all of his tweets insisting it was real, and retweeted Watson. The user didn’t respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast.
Chris, in the meantime, thinks he’s doing a minor public service—to get people be a little more discerning with random “leaks” and pieces of paper floating around the Internet.
“Conspiracy-theory nonsense drives me crazy, as do the random Facebook political hoaxes you see every day,” he said. “I’d like to think people who aren’t in a true-believer camp feel embarrassed when they fall for something obviously fake, and then think twice the next time.”
If Trump sought to blur reality in an effort to give legitimacy to illegitimate conspiracy theories, Chris is doing the opposite. He’s trying to hold a mirror up to those who immediately accept any information that conforms to precisely what they want to believe—no matter how unbelievable it may be.
“Maybe, just maybe the true believers who retweet this stuff gleefully look a little less credible every time,” he said.
His own bullshit has even served to reinforce more bullshit in the far-right message boards that thrive on leaks and anonymous posts with no attribution. “Trump supporters use these for their own, or cite my previous hoaxes to prove new ones are real,” he added.
In the meantime, all Chris asks is for you to do the absolute bare minimum: Make one extra click before you retweet.

Hillary Clinton has long been a centrist. Despite her tack left to woo Bernie Sanders supporters, Clinton retains her centrist roots. Her justices might not be in the mold of Antonin Scalia, but they will be accomplished individuals with the experience, education and intelligence to handle the job.
They will be competent. Just as she is competent.
Trump’s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security. His recent efforts to stay on script are not reassuring. They are phony.
The president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can’t command his own rhetoric.

Being the leader of the free world requires a sense of propriety that Trump lacks.
We understand that Trump’s candidacy tapped a deep discontent among those who feel left behind by a changed economy and shifting demographics.
Their concerns deserve to be discussed with respect.
Ironically, Trump hasn’t done that. He has merely pandered. Instead of offering solutions, he hangs scapegoats like piñatas and invites people to take a swing.
In a nation with an increasingly diverse population, Trump offers a recipe for permanent civil discord.
In a global economy, he offers protectionism and a false promise to bring back jobs that no longer exist.
America needs to look ahead and build a new era of prosperity for the working class.
This is Hillary Clinton’s opportunity. She can reach out to those who feel left behind. She can make it clear that America sees them and will address their concerns.
She can move us beyond rancor and incivility.

0000706,These Shameless Donald Trump Surrogates Should Be Applauded For Their Loyalty,"Following the leaked Access Hollywood audio from the early 2000s and his second terrible debate performance in a row, Donald Trump’s prospects for becoming President grow more bleak with each passing day. Let’s remember, however, that it was so long ago that he steamrolled his GOP competition and looked like he might be a formidable competitor. Trump couldn’t have risen to the front of the Republican pack without a little help from his surrogates. There are dozens of talking heads bouncing from show to show and channel to channel banging the drum for the Donald. While every campaign has their partisans, Trump’s supporters in the media have been some of the most dishonest blowhards ever to rise up in a field known for dishonest blowhards. As the sun sets on Trump’s campaign, let’s look back at the people who brought him this far. Here are the Most Shameless Trump surrogates.
The Arkansas attorney general was trotted out by the Trump campaign once they decided Bill Clinton’s infidelity could be a useful campaign smear. She dutifully made the rounds in the media claiming that Americans don’t care about Trump’s tax returns and that they want to talk about Clinton’s sexual history. CBS’s
Even by Fox News standards, Hannity has been an unabashed Trump supporter from the very beginning. He has even picked fights with co-workers like Megyn Kelly over their refusal to carry water for Trump. In this clip from a few days ago, he was quick to draw parallels between Bill Clinton and Donald Trump and downplay his words as “locker room talk.”
Even before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, Ann Coulter was by his side. Several journalists have reported that conversations with Coulter and her book Adios, America directly shaped Trump’s immigration policies. When Coulter talks about Trump, as in the clip above, she talks like he is the living embodiment of her hard line right wing ideas. No matter what Trump says or does, she stands by Trump’s side, as long as he builds that wall.
Few Trump surrogates are as artless as Pierson. She often speaks with the nuance of the necklace of bullets she likes to wear around her neck. She’s been caught in lies on-air on several occasions, and rarely does a news cycle go by that she doesn’t get herself in hot water. Back in December, she responded to concerns about Trump’s Muslim ban by saying, “So what, they’re Muslims.”
Often seen on CNN, McEnany was a lowly cog in the Fox News machine until she saw her opportunity to seize the limelight during this Trump-ified election cycle. Her resume is so lean that CNN often simply bills her as “Trump Supporter” when they invite her on their air. It doesn’t take long to find video clips where she fails miserably at her Trump supporting high-wire act. Here’s one instance of just such a stumble from an attempted reference to Martin Luther King Jr. on a panel last August.
Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski landed at CNN following his ouster from the campaign after he was accused of assaulting a reporter. Obviously an ethical quagmire, Lewandowski’s hiring became even more suspect when it was revealed that he was

Trump couldn’t successfully distance himself from Burns fast enough; the pastor brought the campaign trouble again when it was revealed that he
New Hampshire representative and Trump veterans coordinator suggested that Hillary “should be put on the firing line and shot for treason” several months ago. When given the chance to walk back the comment,
Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has been one of Trump’s most loyal surrogates. Early this year, he invited people to take unfounded conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton’s health as truth when he said, “Go online and put down ‘Hillary Clinton illness.’ Take a look at the videos for yourself.” Giuliani’s relentless, reckless defense of Trump has continued through his recent troubles. When other Trump surrogates ducked scrutiny this past weekend, Giuliani jumped on the chance to make all five Trump media appearances slated for Sunday morning. Chuck Todd battered him on Meet the Press, but we have no reason to believe he won’t be back for more.
Perhaps the most shameless supporter of Donald Trump has been New Jersey governor Chris Christie. After exchanging heated bluster with Trump throughout the primary season, Christie began supporting Trump with a press conference that reminded Twitter of Game of Thrones. And no, he didn’t look like John Snow.
Tea Party mainstay Scottie Nell Hughes has been a loyal Trump defender throughout the election. She has been forced to defend riots and sexual harassment on behalf of Donald Trump, among other egregious policies and statements from the Donald. As if this wasn’t enough indignity for her to suffer on Trump’s behalf, Ana Navarro recently roasted Hughes for suggesting she was offended by Navarro using the word “p-ssy” when quoting Trump. It seems that these surrogates have no shame, but in this election cycle, Trump is truly testing the limits of even the most craven surrogates. Though, if they’ve made it this far, it seems that there might be nothing that could sway these talking heads away from Trump’s camp.

The child, Malikai Villatte, told Fox 4, “He was screaming at us, cursing at us, calling us the 'n-word' and he came down to the middle of his yard, and I was like 'who are you talking to?,' and he said 'come within arm's reach and I'll show you who I'm talking to.’” Vincent Cerfalo, the man who punched the child, also spat on Villatte after punching his front teeth out according to witnesses.
Now, Cerfalo is claiming self-defense in the whole incident. The 27-year-old man explained his side of the incident to Fox 4, saying, ""I told them to back off and if they come on my property I’m going to defend myself. They said, ‘you won’t hit us, you won’t hit us,’ and they started to surround me.”
Cerfalo went on to say, “It was not my intention to hit anybody that hard, it was not my intention to knock teeth out or do harm, or cause any kind of trouble.”
Despite him saying he was surrounded, the children noted they never touched the man. Cerfalo went on to say that he has plans on pressing charges against the 12-year-old boy, even though he knocked the young boy’s teeth out.",unknown,False

• Was removed from her House Judiciary Committee staffer job because of incompetence and lying.
• The Whitewater scandal.
• Married a serial liar and cheater, who occasionally had sexual encounters with nonconsenting partners.
• Lied about “sniper fire” in an attempt to simulate exposure to danger in a war zone.

• Took crockery, furniture, artwork and other items from the White House — had to return and/or pay for them.
• Said “what difference, at this point, does it make” about four brave people killed in Libya as a direct result of her failure to protect them on the anniversary of 9/11.
• Totally ignored the structure and rules for the handling of sensitive national security information.
• Amassed a personal fortune with “speaking fees” and payments from private sector political donors and foreign governments into transparent “foundations” in obvious exchange for future political favor.

Second, she is identified today in friendly media solely by her “career” post-marriage to Bubba. This is the part that Barack Obama recently described as making her “probably the best qualified person ever to run for president.” This is both laughable and ironic, as she is better qualified than was Mr. Obama, arguably the most unqualified person ever elected president. And, as presidential aspirants go, they had one professional “qualification” in common: Neither had ever worked in a “real job.”
After she and Bill left the White House [along with the furniture, crockery and art work they took with them] she simply punched her ticket with two more political gigs that were handed to her. Neither of which identify her as anything but an opportunist, saying and doing whatever necessary to perpetuate her “new” political career, this while biding her time until she could run for president — twice.
Her time as a senator from New York was purely a block-checking exercise to stay “relevant.” Best illustrating this is the question: Why didn’t they go back to Arkansas? Easy, returning to Arkansas would have been the political — and financial — end for them and they knew it. It’s the same reason the Obamas are not returning to Chicago.

0000716,Trump pardons former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio,"PHOENIX (Tucson News Now) -
After weeks of speculation, President Donald Trump has pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
The White House announced the move on Friday, Aug. 25.
Trump's decision was met with condemnation from some and appreciation from others.
“This is an abuse of the presidential pardon and a full-throated endorsement of selected racial prosecution and bigotry” Rep. Grijalva said. “If you're wronged by law enforcement, this president doesn't have your back. Racist vigilantism has a champion in the White House. This sets a sad precedent that only further divides our nation.”
Arpaio took to Twitter to thank President Trump for the decision.
""I am humbled and incredibly grateful to President Trump,"" he wrote. ""I look forward to putting this chapter behind me and helping to Make America Great Again.""
[READ MORE:
Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt of court last month, the culmination of a federal trial that was years in the making.
The judge found Arpaio disobeyed a judge's order to stop traffic patrols that targeted immigrants. The judge later found his officers were racially profiling Latinos.
[READ MORE: GUILTY:
During his rally at the Phoenix Convention Center on Tuesday night, Trump said he didn't want to pardon Arpaio because he didn't want ""to cause any controversy.""
Trump said he was found guilty of criminal contempt for ""just doing his job.""
He added, ""I think he's going to be just fine.""
U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) released the following statement today on President Trump’s pardon of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio:
“No one is above the law and the individuals entrusted with the privilege of being sworn law officers should always seek to be beyond reproach in their commitment to fairly enforcing the laws they swore to uphold. Mr. Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for continuing to illegally profile Latinos living in Arizona based on their perceived immigration status in violation of a judge’s orders. The President has the authority to make this pardon, but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions.”
Ann Kirkpatrick, candidate for Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, released the following statement regarding President Trump's pardon of former Maricopa Country Sheriff, Joe Arpaio:
""As a former prosecutor, it's clear to me that Joe Arpaio was found in contempt of court for his refusal to respect the law, after he instituted racist policing practices that trampled on the Bill of Rights.Arpaio's lack of respect for the rule of law is unacceptable, and voters held him accountable last fall. Today, President Trump has undermined the rule of law by pardoning him. This is not a ""law and order"" presidency. Trump's decision to undermine the justice system is as troubling as his making excuses for white supremacist groups.The President's actions tonight are an abuse of power.

Describing the entire incident, Nandini said: ""We noticed illegal beef shops when we had gone on a visit to the area. 14 cows were tied there, out of which two calves were being taken to a small room in a nearby area for slaughter. Being animal lovers, we rushed to the nearest police station in Talaghattapura and gave a complaint. We were assured that action was being taken, and police officers were deployed in the area.""
""Since I was getting no updates, I proceeded to the spot with a co-complainant and two police constables in my car itself, since no police vehicle was available. Upon reaching the spot, I saw a mob gathered there, and assumed that there would be police too, as promised. However, there was nobody, and I felt like I was trapped. The mob started hurling concrete blocks, boulders and glass bottles from all directions, screaming pro-Pakistan slogans. It was the worst experience of my life,"" she added.

0000722,Trump says Comey knew he was going to exonerate Clinton,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to revive his long-standing complaint about the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, alleging that then-Director James Comey had protected the Democratic presidential nominee by prematurely “exonerating” her before the 2016 election.
“Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this — obviously a fix?” Trump wrote. “Where is Justice Dept?”
Trump’s latest online burst came in response to the FBI’s release of heavily blacked out draft statements from May 2016 by Comey in preparation for closing the Clinton investigation without criminal charges.
Trump tweeted that the draft statements, whose existence was previously known, show the FBI had exonerated “Crooked Hillary Clinton” long before the investigation was complete. He tweeted: “James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!”
In interview excerpts released in August by the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI officials said Comey and investigators had determined by the spring of 2016 that charges weren’t warranted, and had begun thinking of how the public should be informed of that decision. Clinton was interviewed by the FBI in early July, just days before Comey announced the investigation’s conclusion. That timing has prompted criticism that FBI leadership had prejudged the conclusion before completing the investigation.
When Comey announced the end of the case last year, he said the FBI had found no evidence that anyone intended to violate laws governing classified materials, which it considered a prerequisite for bringing a case. He said the FBI had thoroughly investigated the case for a year before deciding to conclude it.
“We went at this very hard to see if we could make a case,” Comey told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee days after announcing his recommendation that Clinton not face charges.
Trump, as both a candidate and now president, has long complained about the FBI’s handling of the email case, though his criticism has varied.
He initially cited Comey’s actions in the investigation as a basis for Comey’s firing in May, though Trumo later acknowledged that he was determined to replace the FBI director even without the recommendation of the Justice Department.
The president complained again after Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released excerpts of interviews with FBI officials close to Comey. Those interviews showed that draft statements to close out the Clinton investigation had begun circulating among a tight circle of FBI officials in the spring of 2016.
The interviews were conducted by officials from the Office of Special Counsel who were trying to determine if Comey’s actions had violated a federal law that bars government officials from using their positions to influence an election. That investigation was closed following Comey’s firing by Trump in May.

The fact that vans are are easily accessible and they do not require much of a background check has been one of the main reasons for an increase in vehicle terror attacks. Furthermore, they are also cheap, cause great damage and are a convenient way to flee the scene.
It is evident that vehicle terror attacks are slowly replacing suicide bomb attacks due the aforementioned reasons.
Not only must these criminals be punished, the trail that leads to their handlers, their financiers and their recruiters must be followed to the very end – no matter who they are or where they are.
It is also time the world started to rethink its counter-terrorism policy because whatever has been done so far has not only failed, it has amplified the problem.
For too long, the focus has been on the nebulous constructs of ‘radicalisation’ and ‘ideology’. I feel that chasing the smoke trails of dogma will achieve nothing unless the actual players in this grotesque parade of death and terror are neutered.
This wild goose chase has protected from accountability the dictators and monarchs of the Middle East whose brutality and stifling of free speech has done nothing but incubated terrorism.

It is self-evident that the weapons, political intrigue and invasions of powerful nations are the immediate triggers for much of this modern violent extremism.

The song remains the same: It was ‘divide and conquer’ then, it is ‘divide and conquer’ now.

This never was or will be a clash between Islam and the West neither is it in any form or fashion a global pan-Islamic insurgency. What global agenda could those busy-slaughtering-their-own possibly pursue?
In the final analysis, I believe this is a problem arising from the fractious societies and destructive leadership of Muslim majority nations. The fallout in the rest of the world is a direct outcome of the intrusion and positioning of the US, Europe and Russia into these conflicts through war and transfer of weaponry.
A solution to global terrorism will be predicated on political reform in the Muslim world. For the citizens of these nations, unity is the only way tyranny, terrorism and imperialist ambition will be thwarted. Peace will remain a dream unless sectarian, tribal and ethnic divisions exist.
For the West, the best possible course is to pressure their leadership to stop supporting and arming the most brutal regimes in the Muslim world and to cease their ambitions of exploitation and geopolitical game of chess. Interventionism has gained the world nothing but more bloodshed and strife.

0000729,Mike Pence: Donald Trump is ready to lead,"Many voters don't have a clear image in their minds of major party vice presidential nominees Mike Pence and Tim Kaine, despite the nearness of the 2016 presidential election. Here's a look at their similarities and differences. (Dwight Adams/IndyStar) Wochit
In fewer than 40 days, the American people will choose a new president who will set the course of this nation not only for the next four years, but for a generation to come. Between the candidates, the choice could not be more clear.
By electing Donald Trump, the American people have the opportunity to choose a bold leader. In a political world often reserved for talkers, Donald Trump is a doer. I’ve come to know the man who invited me to join him on the Republican ticket as thoughtful, compassionate and steady. Above all, I know he is ready to lead the United States as our next president and commander in chief.
Hillary Clinton’s candidacy embodies the status quo and the failed policies of Washington, D.C. With her we will get more of the same: more taxes, more spending, more regulation and more government.
As Donald Trump and I crisscross the country, it has become clear to me that there is a movement building. This movement reminds me of the one built by a leader whom we now regard as one of our nation’s greatest presidents.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan was regarded by the Washington political establishment as little more than a cowboy or a celebrity who entered politics late in life. He even made some Republicans uneasy. Along the way, people heard his vision of a renewed America. Americans from all walks of life flocked to a man who was so clearly unbound by Washington niceties and political correctness.
Ronald Reagan spoke the truth in 1980 to the American people, just as Donald Trump has in 2016.
Donald Trump is a candidate who speaks honestly and frankly about the challenges we face. I have seen this good man come alongside those whose lives and property were ravaged by floodwaters in Louisiana. I have seen people pack arenas and fairgrounds by the thousands or stand in a driving rainstorm to hear the message of a brighter future.
Donald Trump believes in the greatness of this country and the boundless potential of the American people.
In recent months, Donald Trump has laid out a vision to improve America’s standing at home and abroad. He will rebuild our military, defeat radical Islamic terror and reject the bad deals that jeopardize our security and that of our allies.
At home, Donald Trump will empower the American people to revive our economy. He’ll cut taxes for all Americans and halt onerous new federal regulations. He’ll rewrite our trade deals so they help American workers. He’ll end the war on coal and develop new American sources of energy.
Donald Trump has committed to expanding educational choice for disadvantaged kids. He will repeal Obamacare and make health care more affordable and accessible.
The next president will also set the course and direction of the Supreme Court for decades. To that end, Donald Trump will appoint men and women who will strictly construe the Constitution and not legislate from the bench.
Our opponent stands in every way opposed to the change offered by Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton personifies why the American people have so little confidence in our political leaders. Over three decades in public life, we have grown accustomed to the hallmarks of the Clinton way. Wherever they go, issues of ethics and improprieties are not far behind.
As Hillary Clinton tries to make her case for the highest office in the land, we hear from the FBI of cellphones smashed with hammers, wiped email servers and immunity deals for her closest advisers.
She will raise taxes and put more burdensome regulations on business, ensuring our sluggish economy will remain just that. She has pledged to put coal miners out of business. More U.S. jobs will go overseas.
The American people once again stand at a time for choosing. On one hand, we have a candidate in Hillary Clinton who represents all that is wrong with the status quo in Washington. On the other, Donald Trump has the courage to speak his mind and the boldness to make true his vision of a renewed America.
On Election Day, the choice is clear. To Make America Great Again, we must elect Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States.

0000731,Democrats Worry About Hillary Clinton’s Ground Game,"As
But the good vibes stopped when talk turned to Democrats’ get-out-the-vote efforts. “Somebody’s got to talk to the
Several high-level Democrats who spoke to the Daily Beast are specifically concerned about Democrats’ ground game, which they worry may not be enough to ensure a victory for Clinton and down ballot Democrats in such a tumultuous election year.
The Clinton campaign has vastly outspent the Trump campaign on the air by five to one and boasts a ground game far superior to Trump’s. But in the field especially, Clinton has never measured up to the operation put in place by Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012. Some Democrats worry that just being better than Trump may not be enough for down-ticket Democrats in close races in November.
“I am hearing from people that they are concerned about whether or not were properly or adequately funding our GOTV efforts,” Rep. Jim Clyburn, the third ranking Democrat in the House, said in an interview with the Daily Beast. “I’ve seen some good GOTV plans. On paper they’re great. The question is what about implementation? It’s one thing to see what you need to do, it’s something else to execute.”
Clyburn said he has been traveling extensively for Democratic candidates the country and heard worries about the Democratic ground game in multiple battleground states, including Colorado, where a breakfast with faith leaders turned into conversation about worries over the Democrats’ GOTV effort there.
“I’m really concerned about Florida, Colorado, and Ohio,” Clyburn said. “I just don’t want us to spend all of our money on television, where people are now tuning out commercials, and not do what’s necessary to turn people out.”
Rep. G.K. Butterfield, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he has heard similar concerns and is specifically worried about the Clinton campaign’s investment in African American communities. Butterfield noted they could make the difference in a state like his home of North Carolina, which President Obama lost by 14,000 votes in 2012.
“I don’t know why we have been unsuccessful in being able to make the case for a significant investment in grassroots get out the vote,” Butterfield said. “On the Clinton side and on the DSCC side, I’ve been trying to get them to increase their commitment. They have made some investments, but it’s not enough. “
So far, the Clinton campaign has spent about $21 million on television ads in the state, but far less than the $300,000 Butterfield says could turnout 50,000 African American voters there.
“I just want my friends who run national campaigns to know that it is the local communities that get the job done,” he said. “I think there’s an opinion that it’s not a good investment and that opinion is flawed.”
The good news for Democrats is that the Clinton ground game is vastly superior to Donald Trump’s. A
Clinton’s numbers don’t come close to replicating the Obama operation, which had 789 field offices in 2012. The pattern holds for battleground states. In Florida, Clinton has 68 offices, compared to for 29 Trump, but 103 for Obama. In Virginia, Obama had 61 offices, compared to Clinton’s 27 and Trump’s 11. In Ohio, she has 75, while Trump has 22. Obama had 131 Ohio field office.
“Barack Obama had an army of volunteers in 2012. You could flip a switch and knock on one million doors in Florida in a weekend,” said a Democratic operative involved in GOTV efforts for the party in 2008, 20012, and 2016. “There is no Hillary army. Not even close. In tight races, that matters.”
Democrats outside of the Clinton campaign are putting major cash into efforts to supplement GOTV in must-win states. Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer gave an additional $15 million, on top of $5 million he’d already sent, to For Our Future, a super PAC focused on expand Democrats’ field operations in Florida, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Amanda Brown, the campaign director, said it is designed to turn out the Obama coalition that voted in 2008 and 2012, but skipped the mid-terms. “Voters who many feared wouldn’t show up this time—unless we met them at the door and talked to them about the issues they were most concerned about.”
A Democrat familiar with the Clinton campaign acknowledged the differences between 2012 and this year, but said some of the changes are designed to help downballot races. “In 2012, there was no coordinated campaign, between the top of the ticket and the bottom,” the source said. “In 2016, they’re on all the literature. When Clinton does an event, they’re all invited and included. It’s a priority.”
As for House Democrats, Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the ones on the Tuesday call that she understood the concern about down-ballot races and has shared it with the Clinton campaign. “We have had that conversation with them to say, don’t take anything for granted.”",unknown,False
0000733,Michael Moore Is Worried About Hillary Clinton’s Chances: ‘The Lack of Enthusiasm Is Dangerous’,"“I haven’t spoken to him, so I don’t know if he just saw his name in the title and thought it was pro-him,” Moore told The Daily Beast on Monday from New York. “Was he stupid enough to tweet that without anybody having watched the film? Or is he just crazy as a fox?”
Filmed over two nights in October, TrumpLand is a one-man stage show Moore began writing in August, spurred to action after seeing Democrats around him resting on their laurels a little too heavily following the Democratic convention. “I noticed the people that support Hillary were feeling really confident—and I thought that was dangerous,” he explained. “The more Trump screwed up and the more she won the debates, people just thought more and more that it was in the bag. I didn’t feel that way at all. I guess that’s because I live in Michigan and I see what’s going on and I’m not in an East Coast-West Coast bubble.”
Moore’s idea was to make a point by performing his stand-up show in a Republican city. But the first theater he booked, in the Ohio town of Newark, reneged under pressure from irate local Republicans. He ended up staging it in Wilmington, Ohio, “which was even better because there are like 26,000 registered voters there and only 2,000 of them are registered as Democrats,” he giggled.
Even better: The Wilmington venue, a historic local 400-seat theater, was partially restored with a $50,000 donation from Glenn Beck five years ago. Moore laughs with gratitude. “I do know that the theater took a lot of grief from the Republicans in their town—and there was a state senator who called and threatened to have their arts funding canceled if they didn’t cancel me.”
They didn’t cancel. Eleven days later he premiered Michael Moore in TrumpLand in New York. Last weekend
“It’s also for the Hillary voters who are not very excited,” he added. “The lack of enthusiasm is dangerous.”
“Ten percent of the Hillary vote got depressed with the FBI announcement,” he said, emphasizing that he “wouldn’t take any of it seriously at all.” The damage made by FBI Director James Comey declaring that more Clinton emails are under review, Moore says, is that the “irrelevant” emails have dampened the enthusiasm Hillary’s campaign still desperately needs.
“They’re still going to vote for her,” he said of Clinton supporters, “but they’re not as enthusiastic, and maybe won’t do the work for her this weekend that they were going to.”
Moore’s own position on Hillary has shifted dramatically over the years and through this election. He backed Bernie Sanders through the primary, dubbed Clinton “Wall Street’s paid candidate,” and said he couldn’t vote for her on moral grounds because of her record on Iraq. That Moore disappeared
“I really don’t think it has changed,” he said of his stance on Clinton. “I have a great deal of admiration for her. I felt that way back in the ’90s. I didn’t agree with her or Bill [Clinton] politically necessarily, but I didn’t distrust who they were as human beings. And I feel the same way right now.”
“I feel that her vote on the war was wrong. I feel she’s too close to Wall Street. And I’m also excited that we’re going to elect the first woman president in our history.”
Moore stresses the historical significance of putting a woman in the White House, even after catching heat online for tweeting that “no women ever invented an atomic bomb, built a smoke stack, initiated a Holocaust, melted the polar ice caps or organized a school shooting.”
The blowback didn’t surprise Moore, who chalked some of the criticism to entrenched sexism from his fellow men. “A lot of men are having a hard time with what’s happening. A lot of white guys are having a hard time with it. Eight years of Obama were a huge blow [to them] and [electing a] woman is rattling around in their brains in a way that they can’t make sense out of it.”
“But I only speak the truth,” he added. “I don’t see a lot of girls going into schools and shooting them up. There are two exceptions in 35 years. So of course you have an anomaly, always, for anything. Margaret Thatcher would start a war. But as I pointed out in my last film talking to the first woman president in Iceland, she said, when you have just one woman it’s a token and basically that person’s going to behave much like men behave because that’s how she got the token position. But when women have real power they don’t behave that way. And I’m not trying to say that women are better than men, I’m just trying to say that… women are better than men!”
He considered the impact that third-party mobilization of millennials, in large part toward Sanders’s campaign, has had on this election season. His fellow Bernie supporters should rally behind Hillary, Moore said.
“That Hillary then, that we did not like at the beginning of the year, moved toward Bernie’s position,” he mused. “She adopted two-thirds of his platform! It’s amazing. So I say to my fellow Bernie supporters, what more do you want? She’s gone more than halfway! And she isn’t Margaret Thatcher. What is your problem? Come on!”
“There should be no anger,” he continued, his voice rising. “There should be joy, because we did something historic. We got a socialist elected in 22 states. Nearly half the states voted for a socialist for president. That is stunning! People shouldn’t be angry—they should be taking a bow. We set the tone of the whole election in terms of income inequality! If the Democrats win the Senate, the chairman of the budget committee is a guy named Bernie Sanders! A socialist will be in charge of the budget!”
“If you’re angry about any of that, you need to see somebody.”
Three days after
“I think Julian and WikiLeaks perform a really important service and we can’t have it both ways,” Moore said. “We can’t say it’s OK when they expose the other side but not OK when they post things about our side. Having said that, I think that [Assange] and many of the people voting for Trump would like to see the system—nonviolently—blow up. I can see why Trump likes him, because Trump is essentially an anarchist. Trump is going to blow up the system with no plan for what he’s going to replace what he’s blown up. He has no real plans.”
Moore’s touchstones for analyzing the tumultuous 2016 election, appropriately, parallel the viewing habits of America. It’s how he’s able to explain why he believes Trump has gotten this far in politics, the latest in a long lineage of Republican candidates plucked from show business to elected office.
“I watch Celebrity Apprentice,” admitted Moore. “It’s a very good show. Trump is a well-liked, very popular TV star. And one thing the Republicans have learned—when they run Ronald Reagan, when they run Arnold Schwarzenegger—when they run stars, they win. Democrats don’t do that. We don’t run Oprah or Tom Hanks or any of a number of other people that would win. I’ve never understood that.”
Moore would, for the record, get behind President Oprah Winfrey. “Hell yes! And bring back her show every afternoon at 4 o’clock from the Oval Office. How cool would that be?”
He urges the Democrats to learn from the savvier GOP and put all that Hollywood liberalism to good use. “It drives me crazy,” said Moore. “Part of it is because they don’t understand popular culture, which is odd because Hollywood is so Democratic and so liberal—and yet they don’t understand their own power. In fact, they run from it when they get criticized. The American public loves Hollywood! There are three or four shows on at 7 p.m. about nothing but Hollywood news.”
“I mean, listen,” he began. “Jennifer Hudson lost American Idol, and most people think she won. She lost to Fantasia. Who the fuck is Fantasia, and where is she now? I mean, seriously—anything can happen in this election. The American public is very fickle. Last year on The Bachelorette, everybody thought Kaitlyn was going to go for Nick, and she went with Shawn. That blew everyone’s mind.”
“Well, that’s my warning about next Tuesday. We live in a country that loves The Bachelorette, Celebrity Apprentice, and American Idol; that sits in front of their TVs seven hours a day, and they do strange things. So take nothing for granted over the next eight days. Because this could go the wrong way very quickly.”",unknown,False
0000734,Common: America’s Racism Toward Black People Won’t End With Donald Trump,"There is a sequence in 13th,
Later on, he describes himself to his army of hysterical acolytes as the “law and order” candidate, borrowing a notorious phrase from disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon—the godfather of mass incarceration.
The footage had a profound effect on the
“I really thought about how this situation is affecting us right now, that’s why I wrote Shot me with your ray-gun / And now you want to Trump me, and We staring in the face of hate again / The same they say will make America great again,” says Common. “When I heard Trump in his speech saying he was the ‘law and order candidate,’ it really resonated with me when it came to Nixon and the origins of mass incarceration.”
13th indeed traces the birth of mass incarceration in the U.S. back to Nixon’s War on Drugs, which targeted the enemies of the conservative right: hippies and black people.
“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,” former Nixon domestic-policy chief John Ehrlichman
And so the era of mass incarceration began—one where, from 1980 to 2010, the U.S. prison incarceration rate exploded from 220 to 731 per 100,000 people, despite crime rates steadily declining since the ’90s. The problem has affected black Americans the most: They represent approximately 37.8 percent of the U.S. prison population—the most of any group. Non-Hispanic whites, by comparison, represent 32 percent of the prison population in America despite making up 62.6 percent of the country. 13th is named after the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which outlawed slavery, and posits that mass incarceration is a form of modern-day slavery for African Americans.
“Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,” reads the Thirteenth Amendment.
Common had just finished reading Michelle Alexander’s book The New Jim Crow when DuVernay informed him of the top-secret project. He expressed his desire to make a song for the film, and was met with a surprising response: “OK, maybe you can submit a song. Let’s see.”So he began writing “Letter to the Free” during the last week of July and into the first week in August, inspired by the divisive rhetoric of the Republican National Convention, as well as how the system has kept African Americans as second-class citizens—from slavery to Jim Crow to now mass incarceration.
“I was influenced by this whole political climate, the conditions of mass incarceration, and the injustices going on that even allow us to have a group called Mothers of the Movement,” offers Common. “They continue to drive me towards art that can be a part of the change.”
On the eve of the U.S. presidential election, I’m seated across from the dapper rapper in an office in Midtown Manhattan. The talk soon veers back to that powerful Trump/civil-rights movement montage, and how the Republican candidate has brought racism out of the shadows and into the light.
“I look at these things as finally surfacing and getting out in the open. Those negative forces weren’t courageous enough to come out before because they didn’t have any leader to latch on to,” he says. “You take the racists in our country right now and see that they are supporting Trump, who has not shown any of the qualities to be a great leader, and you think, wow, he is unfit to be president. He’s not even going to run the country better for them because he doesn’t have the intelligence to be president.”
He shakes his head. “The whole birther shit man, it’s like, you are saying this to the president! What is your motive? Whose life will you benefit by doing this? It’s just racism. President Obama is an exceptional human being, so there’s only one reason and one explanation for all the hatred.”
Common, whose eleventh studio album,
“Look, we know it will be a bad situation if Donald Trump becomes president, but we gotta keep working and finding out what to do, because the world isn’t going to end,” he adds. “People say he’ll push a button and end the world, but there are still great people in this country, so I’m not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I still have hope.”
One thing that’s reaffirmed Common’s faith in America is the reaction to 13th, which has received heaps of praise following its release on Netflix, and is a frontrunner for the Best Documentary Oscar.
“When the movie came out, I had friends calling me up to tell me they were spending their weekend watching a documentary on mass incarceration. And it really made me hopeful for the future of this country,” says Common.
He then begins to choke up. “At the New York Film Festival premiere, I was standing on the balcony with Ava and Van Jones, and when the curtain went up it all hit me and I started crying. I felt the pain that a lot of black people have been through in this country and thought, wow man, we are really loving people.”",unknown,False
0000735,Can Comedy Survive President Trump?,"Just before midnight on the east coast Tuesday night, Donald Trump finally stopped being hilarious.
Judd Apatow summed it up best on Twitter. While there is sometimes a feeling among comedians that comedy can heal all wounds, there was nothing funny about what had just happened in America.

It is also notable that while SNL was one of the only comedy shows that found a way to make Hillary Clinton funny, they never quite managed to do the same with Donald Trump.

On September 20th, 2001, Jon Stewart sat behind his desk at The Daily Show and choked back tears as he said, “This show in general, we feel like is a privilege. Just even the idea that we can sit in the back of the country and make wise cracks, which is really what we do. We sit in the back and we throw spitballs, but never forgetting the fact that it is a luxury in this country that allows us to do that. A country that allows for open satire, and I know that sounds basic and it sounds as though it goes without saying—but that’s really what this whole situation is about.”

0000738,LeBron James Delivers Powerful -- And Needed -- Response To Hate Crime,"One day before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, LeBron James' Los Angeles house was vandalized with racial slurs. James did not open his Wednesday afternoon press conference with a statement about his house. But when asked about it, he had a response that was heartfelt, thoughtful and measured -- which is exactly what we've come to expect from him.
""If this is to shed a light and continue to keep the conversation going on my behalf, then I'm OK with it,"" James
James has been a big part of that conversation himself the past few years as one of the most prominent athletes to take political stands.
When Trayvon Martin was shot, James were a black hoodie during warmups. When Eric Garner was killed, James wore an ""I CAN'T BREATHE"" T-shirt. As police shootings and the 2016 presidential campaign brought aspects of racism to the forefront, James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul spoke on race and violence at the ESPYs. James wrote a column to articulate his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president.
""It just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America,"" James continued. ""And hate in America, especially for African Americans, is living every day. And even though that it's concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you, and when they see you, they smile in your face, it's a life every single day.
""And I think back to Emmett Till's mom, actually. It's kind of one of the first things I thought of, and the reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America.
""So it's like it doesn't -- no matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is -- it's tough. And we got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans, until we feel equal in America. But my family is safe, and that's what's important.""
LeBron James shares thoughts on his Los Angeles house getting vandalized.
LeBron James is not Muhammad Ali. He is not traveling the world fighting injustices in impoverished nations. He is not Colin Kaepernick, staging a protest before every game.
But when he speaks about important issues, his words have impact -- and it's not just because he's a celebrity. He educates himself and has substantial opinions. He is cognizant of his voice and is mindful of when to use it.
Last fall, a reporter asked James about Kaepernick's national anthem protests. James said he would not kneel, but recognized the need for Kaepernick to have that freedom. He then transitioned the conversation to a personal thought James had been having -- an example other black parents could relate to.
""You have the right to voice your opinion, stand for your opinion, and he's doing it in the most peaceful way I've ever seen someone do something,"" James
James has his haters -- from both sides. There are people who feel that he's just an athlete who should stick to sports. Then there are people who think James does not do enough with his mega-reach to create legitimate progress.
If you're among those who wished James would have gone even deeper into this subject Wednesday, consider that basketball is still his priority, particularly this week when he needs to focus on figuring out how to guard Kevin Durant.
But James made it clear again Wednesday that if he can be this engaged in political dialogue while he's still playing in the NBA, we can only expect even more once he's retired.

0000742,Which Presidents Were Left-Handed?,"There have been eight left-handed presidents that we know of. However, this number is not necessarily accurate because in the past left-handedness was actively discouraged. Many individuals who would have grown up left-handed were in fact forced to learn how to write with their right hand. And, if recent history is any indication, left-handedness seems to be far more common among U.S. presidents than it is among the general population. Naturally, this apparent phenomenon has led to many speculations.
What is perhaps most noteworthy about left-handed presidents is how many there have been in recent decades. Of the last 15 presidents, seven (about 47%) have been left-handed. That might not mean much until you consider that the global percentage of left-handed people is about 10%. So among the general population, only 1 in 10 people are left-handed, while in the modern-era White House, almost 1 in 2 have been left-handed. And there's every reason to believe that this trend will continue because it's no longer standard practice to steer children away from natural left-handedness.
A quick count of political parties in the list above shows the Republicans slightly ahead of the Democrats, with five of the eight lefties being Republican. If the numbers were reversed, perhaps someone would argue that left-handed people are more in line with left politics. After all, many people believe that left-handedness seems to correspond to creative, or at least ""out of the box"" thinking, pointing to famous lefty artist such as Pablo Picasso, Jimi Hendrix and Leonardo Di Vinci. While this theory obviously wouldn't be supported by the history of left-handed presidents, the unusually high percentage of lefties in the White House may point to other characteristics that may give lefties an edge in leadership roles (or at least at winning elections):
So, if you're a lefty who gets annoyed with all the right-handed bias in the world, perhaps you can help change things as our next president.",unknown,False

Around midnight, a Benton police officer heard two loud bangs within a minute of each other in downtown Benton. The officer then noticed a vehicle driving fast and promptly pulled the car over.
When questioned, the driver revealed he was suffering from a gunshot wound in his left thigh. He then told officers that 45-year-old Gregory Overton shot him near the 300 block of South Main Street.
As Benton Fire Rescue personnel were tending to the victim's injuries, shots were fired in their direction. One of the shots was heard hitting vegetation ""directly behind"" the officers on scene.
The SWAT team was called out to the scene and Overton was arrested shortly after their arrival. Police recovered a gun they believe was the one used by Overton.

0000745,BOOM! Wikileaks Confirms Hillary Sold Weapons To ISIS.,"Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is a controversial character. But there’s no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and he’s willing to expose Hillary Clinton.Now, he’s announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria.
Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.
WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested:
The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua.
In Obama’s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.
Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called “Friends of Syria” (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.
Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack.
In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks’ Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
Here is the incredible transcript:
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what’s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn’t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it’s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case—or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We can’t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.
So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails. There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.
It appears that Hillary Clinton committed perjury, just like her husband was caught doing as President.",unknown,True
0000746,CNN Commentator: White People Don’t Get to Complain About Black Protests,"Symone Sanders, a Democratic strategist and political commentator for CNN, ripped into conservative Ben Ferguson, also a CNN commentator, for daring to complain about the NFL kneeling protests, saying white people have no right telling black people what to do.
Sanders forgets that we live in a free country where criticisms aren’t limited to people with certain skin tones, but she can’t see past her own racist anger to follow a logical train of thought. She has a huge problem with folks like Ferguson, or Donald Trump, telling NFL players they should stand for the national anthem.
Ferguson made the case that our national leaders should not attend a football game where players are disrespecting the country they took an oath to defend. He likens kneeling against the flag as “basically giving the middle finger to the men and women who have fought to protect this country.” Therefore, a president should be able to speak out against such actions.
CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield also made her disagreement with Ferguson known and attempted to correct him for having an opinion. But Sanders was too loud to control.
“You should be ashamed for perpetuating this lie,” Sanders said.
Whitfield laughed and agreed, “Yeah, nobody’s done that,” referring to the middle finger comment.
Ferguson presented further arguments which really allowed Sanders ideology to come to light:
“White people do not get to tell black folks, or anybody else, what is an acceptable form of protest.”
“Not everything is about race, Symone,” Ferfuson retorted.
“Maybe not for you, it is,” Sanders fired back.
Before Sanders spewed racism on national television, she was doing it behind the scenes as press secretary for Bernie Sanders. Go figure.",unknown,True
0000747,This CIA Official Destroys Obama’s Lies Comes Clean About What Islam Really Wants From America,"It is clear to us now that Islam is not a religion. It is an evil, oppressive ideology with governmental, judicial, educational, militaristic, and societal aspects to it which are shrouded behind the veil of religion to give it legitimacy.
As such, it is completely incompatible with our Constitution and the nature of our free society.
We hear Muslims saying they want to destroy us. Now a CIA operative says the same thing. What else do we need for liberals and Democrats to understand what the Muslims are going to do?
Ex CIA operative Clare Lopez has said for years that extremist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood have infiltrated the Obama administration and are carrying out their agendas through U.S. foreign policy. Lopez has extensive experience with Middle East culture and the religion of Islam. Therefore she gave her reasons why Muslims are extremely dangerous to our way of life.
Speaking about why there is an Islamic prosecution of non-Muslim religious minorities she said: “The faith of not being Muslim, that is why those groups are executed- because they are not Muslim.”
She then added: “What we are seeing today is a continuation of what was begun at the earliest times after the beginning of Islam and the death of Muhamed.”
Nice Speech, hopefully, people wake up and defend our lands from Islam the worst disease of mankind. You must listen to this. Helps to understand what the Muslims are really about. There’s even mention of the liberal left. The USA is heading down the path of other extinct cultures and religions due to the overwhelming presence of radical Muslims, and what their beliefs are.
Wake up, people! We must save our country by opening our eyes, acknowledging what the problem is, and defending ourselves.

Like many other Hillary Clinton supporters, Lena Dunham spent the evening of Nov. 8 in a state of shock.
In a new essay for Lenny, Dunham wrote about her night at the Clinton campaign's NYC viewing party, and how the elation she felt after going to the polls and phone-banking for her candidate turned into horror as the results rolled in.
""After working on the Clinton campaign for eighteen months, I was ready to celebrate, and sure that by nightfall I'd be knocking back glasses of champagne and creating a story to tell my unborn children,"" she wrote about her rosy outlook Tuesday. ""Maybe I'd even get close enough to Hillary Clinton to hug her, to whisper 'Thank you.'""
Her social media accounts echo her jovial mood that day.
I love you all! Tonight we make history! I may or may not wear a bow.
By the end of the night, Dunham was creating a very different story. ""At home I got in the shower and began to cry even harder. My boyfriend, who had already wept, watched me as I mumbled incoherently, clutching myself. 'It wasn't supposed to go this way. It was supposed to be her job. She worked her whole life for the job. It's her job.'""

Dunham ended her essay by acknowledging that, while she's saddened by this election's results, more marginalized groups have been let down by the political system time and time again.
""It's a privilege to be heartbroken by the system for the first time at age 30,"" she wrote. ""So many people — those in the prison system, those with undocumented American relatives, those who are trans, who are queer, who are people of color, who are Muslim, who are trying to prosecute their abusers — have felt the crushing failure of the system over and over again.""

0000752,Police union hires Chicago cop who shot Laquan McDonald to work as janitor,"Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the status of Jason Van Dyke’s court proceedings.
CHICAGO — The city's police union has hired the cop facing first-degree murder charges in the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald to work as a janitor.
Jason Van Dyke, who was charged in November for the incident that set off weeks of protests in the city, will be paid $12 per hour. News of the hiring by the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, which was first reported by
The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Catholic priest and prominent activist on the city's South Side, called the move by the union ""a disgrace"" and a setback for efforts to restore fraught relations between the police department and the African-American community.
""The Police Union says to Chicago ... we don't give a damn what he did, what you think, he is one of ours, and we are going to take care of him,"" Pfleger wrote on his Facebook page.
The union has shown support for Van Dyke since he was charged on the same day the city was forced by court order to release chilling dashcam video that showed Van Dyke, who is white, fire 16 shots at the black teen. Van Dyke was charged 400 days after the incident.
Van Dyke opened fire within seconds of arriving on the scene, saying that he feared for his life. At least five police officers at the scene backed up Van Dyke in official police statements following the shooting, according to investigative documents released by the city. Van Dyke told investigators that McDonald was moving toward him when he started firing. The dashcam video, however, appears to show McDonald moving away from Van Dyke when the officer opened fire.
Van Dyke was suspended without pay after he was charged. The officer's attorney, Dan Herbert, had previously said that Van Dyke was having trouble finding work in the aftermath of the incident.
Van Dyke, who has pleaded not guilty, remains free on bail as he awaits trial.
Van Dyke began working nights at the FOP headquarters about three weeks ago. Dean Angelo Sr., the union president, defended the hiring.
“We do this for our membership and this is what the FOP stands for, fraternalism,"" Angelo told WFLD. ""This officer is in a very difficult situation financially; he has a family and we would do it for anybody that works as a Chicago Police officer.""

0000753,Obama won't criticize FBI director over Clinton email investigation,"Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that President Obama does not believe FBI Director James Comey was trying to impact the election by announcing the FBI will reopen Hillary Clinton's email investigation. USA TODAY NETWORK
WASHINGTON — The White House professed its neutrality Monday in the growing debate over FBI Director James Comey's decision to notify Congress that he had resumed the agency's investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails.
""I’ll neither defend nor criticize what Director Comey has decided to communicate to the public about his decision,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after speaking to Obama about the issue. He described Obama as ""pretty even-keeled"" about the news, even in the midst of his aggressive campaign schedule on Clinton's behalf.
Earnest's statement came amid growing criticism of Comey's handling of the investigation, both from Democrats and even some Republicans.
""Director Comey is a man of integrity, he's a man of principle, and he's a man of good character,"" Earnest said. ""He's in a tough spot. And he's the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism.""
The FBI does not usually notify Congress about pending investigations. But in a letter to congressional committees Friday, Comey said he felt obliged to do so because he had previously testified that the investigation had been completed.
Justice Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the FBI discovered Clinton emails on a computer co-owned by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her now-estranged husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner. The FBI is investigating Weiner's communications with an underage girl.
The Democratic presidential nominee's emails have been a campaign issue since The New York Times reported that she used a private email server to send and receive official emails, many of which turned out to be classified.
In between the lines of Earnest's non-criticism of Comey, however, were suggestions that the White House isn't entirely happy with how Comey has handled the emails. Comey's July news conference contained ""some rather harsh condemnations"" of Clinton, and much of his subsequent congressional testimony ""provided fodder to Secretary Clinton's critics,"" Earnest said.
He said Obama believes the FBI director's substantial authority to conduct investigations should be ""tempered by an adherence to longstanding tradition and practice and norms that limit public discussion of facts that are collected in the context of those investigations.""
But Earnest also said President Obama does not believe that Comey intended to influence the election, or that he was ""secretly strategizing"" to benefit Clinton's opponent, Donald Trump. That would suggest that Obama does not believe Comey violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their office to intentionally influence an election, and which would give Obama grounds to remove Comey from office.

0000754,"Michelle Obama blasts Trump, says his comments have 'shaken me to my core'","The first lady delivered an impassioned speech during a Clinton rally in New Hampshire, saying Trump's controversial comments about women should be taken seriously.
Since the Democratic convention, where her
At a campaign event Thursday, the first lady again took on the Republican presidential nominee, reacting to his latest, perhaps most explosive controversy yet: the recently released 2005 recording in which he's heard graphically discussing groping women, which was followed this week by accusations from multiple women that he'd made unwanted sexual advances toward them, which he has denied.
""Last week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women,"" the first lady said in Manchester, N.H., ""and I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women.""
She continued: ""I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted.""
The first lady said it would be ""dishonest"" and ""disingenuous"" for her ""to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.""
""It's not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season,"" she added of the Trump recording.
She also seemed to allude to reports that surfaced Wednesday night in The New York Times and elsewhere of women accusing Trump of sexual misconduct in years past, saying that ""it now seems very clear"" the recording released last Friday wasn't ""an isolated incident.""
""I listen to all of this, and I feel it so personally,"" she said, adding that women, in particular, likely felt the same way.
""The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, the belief that you can do anything you want to a woman — it is cruel, it's frightening, and the truth is, it hurts,"" she said of Trump's comments.
Following her remarks at the Democratic convention, the percentage of Americans who said they viewed the first lady favorably rose to 64%, according to a Gallup survey, a figure that makes her far more popular than either of the presidential nominees. During that speech, Obama, without naming him, asserted that Trump was unfit to fulfill the role of national role model.
""This election, and every election, is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives,"" the first lady said. ""And I am here tonight because in this election, there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility, only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be president of the United States, and that is our friend, Hillary Clinton.""
Obama revisited that theme Thursday in New Hampshire, laying out what she said were the stakes for the nation's children.
“In our hearts, we all know that if we let Hillary’s opponent win in this election, that we are sending a clear message to our kids: that everything they’re seeing and hearing is perfectly OK,"" she said.
""We're telling our sons that it's OK to humiliate women,"" the first lady said. ""We're telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated. We're telling all our kids that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country.""
She added: ""If we have a president who routinely degrades women, who brags about sexually assaulting women, then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world?""

0000755,Paris attack heightens European tensions with Muslims,"Another police officer in Paris was killed in a shooting Thursday morning as a manhunt for two of the gunmen suspected in an attack on French satirical magazine 'Charlie Hebdo' continued. VPC
Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated German Chancellor Angela Merkel's first name.
The terrorist attack on the satirical weekly in Paris threatens to create deeper animosities between Europe's growing Muslim minority and a native population that is increasingly embracing anti-Islam and anti-immigration movements.
""The radicals are trying to exacerbate tensions that are already there,"" said Jonathan Laurence, author of Integrating Islam: Political and Religious Challenges in Contemporary France. ""They're trying to drive a wedge between Muslims and the West.""
From France and Germany to Sweden and the United Kingdom, a backlash is spreading against Muslim immigrants, including tens of thousands of recent refugees from Syria's long civil war.
In France, which has Western Europe's largest Muslim community, the anti-immigration National Front Party won 25% of the vote in the most recent elections in May, and radical anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim protests have taken place in multiple German cities in recent days.
Until now, those and similar movements in other Western European countries have focused on limiting immigration and protecting the rights of publications to criticize Islam. They also have tried to halt what they view as excessive accommodations to Muslim culture: the use of Arabic language, headscarves worn by women, establishment of mosques, and serving halal food in school cafeterias.
Wednesday's attack will provide a security element to those arguments, said Laurence, who teaches political science at Boston College. It ""ties a foreign threat of violence in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and Libya and brings it home and raises the conflict temperature to a dangerous levels within Europe,"" he said.
Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center on Freedom at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also predicted greater cultural conflicts in Europe. ""It's inevitable there are going to be greater tensions now in France,"" Gardiner said. ""These attacks will elevate the issue of homegrown jihadists to the top of the political agenda.""
A similar discourse will take place all over Europe, as it has already in the United Kingdom, Gardiner said. ""There's a massive homegrown terrorist threat in the U.K. It's also an issue in Belgium, Holland, Germany and across Western Europe,"" he said. ""This attack will up the stakes.""
French and other European officials have warned of heightened terrorist threats from citizens who identify with radical Islamist groups in North Africa and the Middle East, while political and populist leaders have railed against their countries' immigration policies, which they've characterized as lax and threatening to European culture.
The attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, which poked fun at Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox Jewish clerics, fits into a pattern of radical Muslim reprisals against European critics in the world of culture.
In 1989, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa (legal decree) calling for the death of author Salman Rushdie over his allegedly blasphemous portrayal of Islam's prophet Mohammed. Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered in 2004 for his film, Submission, about the treatment of women in Islam. And Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard escaped an assassination attempt in 2010 for his 2005 cartoon portrayal of the prophet, which caused riots and protests across the Muslim world.
Thousands of Germans took part this week in anti-immigration rallies in Dresden, Berlin and Cologne, organized by a group known as PEGIDA, a German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. Germany's political establishment, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, denounced the rallies as undemocratic and hateful.
The group was started by PEGIDA leader Lutz Bachmann in October to protest plans to add 14 centers for about 2,000 refugees in Dresden. Demonstrators reject charges they are far-right extremists or neo-Nazis. They say they are concerned by an influx of 200,000 refugees in 2014, many from war-torn Syria.
Similar sentiments have been expressed in Sweden by members of the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats Party, which centrist parties sought to isolate and weaken last month by forming a broad parliamentary coalition. In France, the National Front Party headed by Marine Le Pen has gained support among working-class voters who believe the mainstream politicians have failed to address their concerns about crime, immigration and jobs.
""There's a growing sense across France that immigration laws have been too weak,"" Gardiner said.
He predicted that French officials would crack down on preachers of hate in radical mosques in Paris and other large French cities, and on French citizens seeking to fight with radical Islamist groups in Iraq or Syria. Whether that means far-right groups gain support depends on French President Francois Hollande's response, Gardiner said.
France has been at the forefront of European nations in the fight against Islamist extremists in the Middle East and North Africa, focusing on its former 20th-century colonies. Hollande sent 3,000 troops to Mali to battle Islamist extremists who'd taken over a large swath of that former colony. He also joined the U.S.-led coalition launching airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. And on Monday, Hollande said he would strike at Islamist militants in Libya who try to cross or send weapons into neighboring Niger, where France has a base.
France's domestic immigration issues also stem from its colonial past, including a civil war for independence from French control in Algeria that led to a flood of refugees into France in the early 1960s.
""France has this colonial legacy to deal with when negotiating the integration of the millions of descendants of these colonial subjects,"" author Laurence said. ""It's a political problem. What the violence does is prevent a political solution because it tends to polarize and make it appear the problem is not resolvable politically and can only be resolved militarily.""",unknown,False
0000756,Trump’s Speech: Dog Whistles to the Sovereign-Citizen Set,"It’s easy to forget how silly most people thought
I spent much of that month at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge,
As Trump has become an ever-more-worrisome figure, you can track his descent into right-wing madness easily. There were the Red Meat days, where he was merely a bigot. Then came the alt-right phase, the joyous celebration of Daddy Trump and Pepe the Frog and the oven jokes on Twitter. Trump has by now lied so often and so blatantly that many people thought it a little joke when
But for once the man was telling the truth, and in the last day or so America has watched with dawning horror as we realize that if he wasn’t lying about being a sex criminal, perhaps he has not been lying about the walls and the deportations and the locking up of his political opponents. Maybe he’s actually been telling the truth about himself this whole time.
I watched his speech Thursday, and if I closed my eyes, I could smell the campfire smoke at the Malheur refuge and feel the Oregon winter wind on my face. Here were the conspiracies, the references to the shadowy international cabals, the whispers about the illegitimacy of the Department of Justice and the Trilateralist coopting of the FBI.
It was like listening to an immodest Ammon Bundy. We have to protect ourselves from not just the government (because it is only a pawn) but from the people who really run it. We should be watchful, resilient, ready—and though he is reluctant, he will sacrifice himself, for he is the only one who can save us from the terror.
Donald Trump shouted out every fevered dystopian fantasy I heard on the refuge, with the exceptions of Agenda 21 and abortion as population control. “They control the Department of Justice,” he said. “They have essentially corrupted the director of the FBI.” “This is a conspiracy against you, the American people, and we cannot let this happen or continue. This is our moment of reckoning.” This is precisely the logic that led a few hundred people to take up arms against the government in Oregon, though at least Ammon Bundy started with a reasonably legitimate premise. Donald Trump doesn’t even have two Americans jailed twice for the same crime to legitimize his quest.
What he has is a small but growing fringe that talks about We the People instead of Americans. We have already seen the violence at his rallies, we have seen the vicious street attacks, we have worried about the rise of the right. What I have not until Thursday heard was something that spiked my nativist upbringing, words delivered in a very particular order that made me want to go buy another rifle and check my food storage.
I was raised among white people, sent to an elementary school in which there were no black kids, and then moved to the mountains of Utah for high school, where the neo-Nazis recruited at illicit drinking parties because kids who would have a beer were already disaffected in an overwhelmingly Mormon culture. There is a part of me that remembers the coding, the tones, remembers the fear that the government might come and massacre us again as they had in times not that long ago. I reject it violently, but you don’t ever forget what you were raised to believe even if you learn better.
It would take a linguist to comb through that speech and parse out which words came from where. I am only a writer steeped in the language of right-wing revolution. I was outraged by Trump before. But now I am worried. There is no scenario in which this country repudiates him and then goes about its business; we allowed his rise and we have emboldened the people that we ignored for so long. We have three weeks to go yet, more scandals and reactions and fear and terror, and at the end of it, we will have an unknowable number of people who will absolutely and without question think that Hillary Clinton’s election is an unmistakable sign that it is time for the governed to withdraw their consent.
Not a majority; not even many, compared to the millions of people who live in America. But enough. Thursday, Donald Trump traveled a step further down the path of militant right-wing revolution. It wasn’t a call to arms, exactly. But it was far past the point of comfort.",unknown,True

“Over the past several weeks, I have been inundated with text, emails, and phone calls from people of all walks of life across the state of Nevada who are upset with Dean Heller for campaigning one way in Nevada and voting the exact opposite in Washington DC. The refrain is the same: he turned his back on us.
Today, after much thought and discussion with my family and friends, I have decided to run for the United States Senate. I am running for United States Senate because Nevada deserves a Senator who will keep his word and vote in Washington DC the same way he campaigns here in Nevada.
I am a conservative Republican who supports the policies of President Trump to repeal Obamacare and end illegal immigration. I will continue to support President Trump's policies that have led to a 20% increase in the stock market in just six months. I will join Senator Lee, Senator Cruz, and Senator Paul fighting for real reforms against the liberals in our party.
I look forward to campaigning across the state of Nevada and earning your support. It is time to take a stand. Together, we will make our state, and our country, proud.”
With rumors of Republican's growing upset with Heller's opposition to President Trump's policies, it comes as no surprise that Tarkanian will placate towards the disgruntled sector of the party.
Time will tell if this platform will be enough to give Tarkanian that elusive political victory.

RELATED:
And these aren't pets who are just being left inside, Director of Animal Care Diane Suave said.
“They are left in a yard, in a pen they cannot escape from or tethered to trees or poles,” she said.
Palm Beach County Animal Care reports animal control officers have rescued 49 dogs and two cats in the last 48 hours.
“Even a tiny bit of sand can hurt an animal when it’s traveling through 100-plus mph winds,” Sauve said.
Animal control officers were slowly pulled off the road at 2:30 p.m. Saturday.
Sauve said once winds reach a sustained 35 mph, no officers will be permitted to rescue animals.
“We are asking the public, if it is safe, consider sheltering any animals you see left outside,” she said.
Both Sauve and State Attorney Dave Aronberg said they promise to prosecute anyone who left their animals outside to fend for themselves during Hurricane Irma.
“This is a prime example of animal cruelty,” Aronberg said. “We will find you, and we will prosecute you.”
Sauve said officials will use every paper trail imaginable to track down animal cruelty offenders.

0000763,Justice Dept to offer Hillary a PLEA bargain — there’s just ONE catch,"America chose not to vote for Hillary Clinton after leaked emails revealed her as a threat to national security. Democrats work long hours trying to play it off as a simple mistake even though Clinton was well aware of how to handle classified information.
Naturally, their next defense was to attack the President in a lame attempt for impeachment by falsifying reports of Russian collusion in the hopes that this tactic would distract the public from the real issue.
Hillary Clinton knowingly endangered the safety of America by flouting her top security clearance in thousands of emails where she disclosed information on an open email server that she should have never had in the first place. Although two investigations were opened by the FBI in regards to this crime nothing came from either one. Now, it’s time for a third investigation to be conducted by the DOJ and things aren’t looking good for Clinton this time around.
According to reports, the Justice Department reopened the investigation into Clinton’s homebrewed email server. Suddenly, it appears Clinton may not be in the clear after all.
From the Daily Wire:
“The Justice Department has reopened the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified material on her private email system while she was secretary of state, and is considering offering her a plea bargain if she will agree to plead guilty to charges of breaking the law, according to a Clinton attorney,”
The discussion of a plea bargain took place late last month and was offered by a high-ranking Justice Department official to the Clinton lawyer.
During the exploratory talks with the prosecutor, the Clinton attorney was told that despite former FBI Director James Comey’s decision last July not to prosecute Hillary, the Justice Department has reexamined the email case and believes there are ample grounds for prosecuting Hillary on a number of counts.
As part of the plea, Clinton would be forced to admit guilt:
Under the Justice Department’s plea offer, Hillary would be required to sign a document admitting that she committed a prosecutable crime. In return, the DOJ would agree not to bring charges against Hillary in connection with the email probe.
Also as part of the agreement, the Justice Department would not proceed with an investigation of Hillary’s pay to play deals with foreign governments and businessmen who contributed to the Clinton Foundation or who paid Bill Clinton exorbitant speaking fees.",unknown,True

Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he was ""heartbroken."" President Donald Trump tweeted a message to the Kissimmee Police Department early Saturday morning.
""My thoughts and prayers are with the Kissimmee Police and their loved ones,"" Trump said. ""We are with you.""
Howard and Baxter, who were both wearing their uniforms, were shot about 9:30 p.m. in a neighborhood known for having drug activity, O'Dell said. Both officers were taken to Osceola Regional Hospital where doctors pronounced Baxter dead Friday night and Howard dead Saturday.
Four suspects were in custody early Saturday morning, O'Dell said. Detectives arrested Everett Glenn Miller, a 45-year-old military veteran with a history of mental health issues, at the Roscoe's Bar at 2344 N. Orange Blossom Trail. Police officers said he was in possession of a 9 mm and a .22 revolver.

According to the center, there are 40 hate groups inside Florida, and 917 total in the country.
The groups vary from anti-muslim to neo-nazi, white nationalist and KKK groups.
This list was compiled using hate group publications and websites, citizen and law enforcement reports, field sources and news reports. Groups that appear in the center of states represent statewide groups.
An attorney for the Liberty Counsel told Local 10 news that the Liberty Counsel is not a hate group.
""We hate no one, and love all people. All people have inherent dignity and deserve respect because they are created by God in His image,"" Richard Mast said in an email.
President Donald Trump, facing mounting pressure from Republicans and Democrats alike, did what he declined to do over the weekend during an event at the White House on Monday when he directly condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis in a brief statement to reporters.
""Racism is evil -- and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,"" Trump said in response to the attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.
""Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America,"" Trump said.
The comments came in a hastily scheduled White House event in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where Trump -- speaking with the help of a teleprompter -- spoke straight to camera after meeting with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to discuss the Department of Justice's civil rights investigation into the attack.
""To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable,"" he said. ""Justice will be delivered. ""
Trump had been excoriated for his unwillingness to condemn the groups behind the violent protests that left one woman dead who was hit by a car allegedly driven by a man with ties to white supremacy groups.
After blaming the violence ""on many sides"" Saturday, Trump stayed silent for close to 48 hours, letting his trademark bluntness and campaign pledges to call terrorism what it is succumb to silence and vagueness.
Trump was asked by reporters after he spoke why he waited so long to condemn these hate groups by name and did not respond.

0000771,Map details where Texas hate groups are in 2017,"SAN ANTONIO - Hate groups are still active in every state in America in 2017.
According to a map on the
Of those active groups, 55 are in Texas, including several in San Antonio.
The hate groups range from neo-nazi to black separatists.
55 Texas groups:
This list was compiled using hate group publications and websites, citizen and law enforcement reports, field sources and news reports. Groups that appear in the center of states represent statewide groups.
President Donald Trump, facing mounting pressure from Republicans and Democrats alike, did what he declined to do over the weekend during an event at the White House on Monday when he directly condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis in a brief statement to reporters.
""Racism is evil -- and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,"" Trump said in response to the attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.
""Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America,"" Trump said.
The comments came in a hastily scheduled White House event in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where Trump -- speaking with the help of a teleprompter -- spoke straight to camera after meeting with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to discuss the Department of Justice's civil rights investigation into the attack.
""To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable,"" he said. ""Justice will be delivered. ""
Trump had been excoriated for his unwillingness to condemn the groups behind the violent protests that left one woman dead who was hit by a car allegedly driven by a man with ties to white supremacy groups.
After blaming the violence ""on many sides"" Saturday, Trump stayed silent for close to 48 hours, letting his trademark bluntness and campaign pledges to call terrorism what it is, succumb to silence and vagueness.
Trump was asked by reporters after he spoke why he waited so long to condemn these hate groups by name and did not respond.

0000783,Fox News’ Eboni Williams Tears Into David Clarke For Calling John Lewis ‘John Who?’,"Prior to
Right off the bat, co-host Pete Hegseth asked Clarke what he thought about Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), a civil rights icon, deciding not to attend the opening because Trump would be in attendance. Clarke reacted by immediately dismissing Lewis.
“John who?” Clarke mocking stated.
“John Lewis — he was bloodied on the Selma bridge, Sheriff, when trying to protest voting rights and a variety of other things,” guest host Eboni Williams said in response.
Clarke shot back that he knew who Lewis was and that he had become one of the “most irrelevant members of Congress,” adding that Lewis has been “reduced to being a caricature” before praising Trump for realizing that “actions speak louder than words.”
“Sheriff let me say this to you,” Williams said. “For you to say that nobody cares about John Lewis is inaccurate because I assure you that there are many people across this country that absolutely do care about him.”
She added, “As for your commentary on his political record as a congressman, I’m actually not even addressing that part because this museum opening is about the civil rights of American citizens, so when it comes to his record on that, Sheriff Clarke, I think that it’s pretty undisputed.”
The ex-sheriff replied by saying that most people under the age of 35 don’t know who John Lewis is before bringing up that if it weren’t for Republicans, there’d be no Civil Rights Act because President Lyndon Johnson had to get GOP votes to pass it.
“I appreciate that history lesson but as somebody that holds a degree on the subject I really don’t need you to update me on who was required for Lyndon B. Johnson to pass the Civil Rights Act,” Williams stated.
“Apparently, you’ve forgotten some of your history,” Clarke retorted, leading Williams to smile back and tell him that she doesn’t actually have anything against Republicans. Meanwhile, Hegseth jumped back in to help Clarke out by stating he wouldn’t have even known about the museum if it wasn’t for Trump’s visit today. Of course, Clarke was completely in agreement with that comment.

0000788,President Obama honors U.S. Olympians present and past at White House,"USA's Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games teams were honored by President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday.
“We admire your athleticism, but we also admire your character,” Obama said to the packed room. “Remember that you know when someone's watching you for the first time, and they see how hard you work, and what you accomplish, and they feel inspired. They feel like they can take any challenge on. What you do has ripples all across the country.”
The President attributed the success of the American team to its diversity: “Everybody's from all different kinds of backgrounds, and all shapes and sizes … although all very good looking,” Obama said.
“Imagine what it means for a young girl or a young boy who sees somebody who looks like them doing something and being the best at what they do,” he continued. “There's no kid in American who can't look at our Olympic team and see themselves somewhere. That's part of the reason why we're successful.”
He also pointed out how the “preponderance” of U.S. women paved the way to the country's Olympic dominance in Rio, calling out gymnast Simone Biles, swimmers Simone Manuel and Katie Ledecky and cyclist Kristin Armstrong, among others. “2016 belonged to America's women Olympians,” Obama said. “Y'all crushed it.”
The President also took time to pay tribute to track star Jesse Owens, as well as Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who raised their firsts in silent protest during the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City — because they “paved the way” for the current diverse Olympic team.
“We're proud of them,” Obama said. “Their powerful silent protest in the 1968 Games was controversial, but it woke folks up and created greater opportunity for those that followed.”
Here's how some Team USA members shared their day at the White House on social media.

0000792,The Democratic Party's obsession with Hollywood celebrities was bound to blow up | The Fresno Bee,"The Democratic Party’s obsession with Hollywood celebrities was bound to blow up. The party’s reliance on the entertainment industry reached a crescendo during the 2016 presidential campaign when, according to the Wrap, at least 167 Hollywood elites endorsed Hillary Clinton.
And these were not passive endorsements. For Democrats, celebrities became a meaningful source of money, message delivery and even a tool for crowd-building at Clinton’s anemic campaign events.
Anyway, Clinton lost and Donald Trump became president. And then came
But with some 30 women accusing Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, is the Weinstein scandal big enough to cause a break between the Democratic Party and the entertainment industry? The answer is no.
Be the first to know when big news breaks
Recaptcha requires verification.
protected by reCAPTCHA
In January, I cited a useful piece written by New York Post writer and editor Maureen Callahan, “Why celebrity endorsements didn’t help Hillary at all,” and her words warrant repeating: “That those who have money, fame, privilege and status and have no cause to worry – and fail to do so – can only further divide the country and alienate those who, rightly, feel unseen, unheard and looked down upon.”
And after Clinton lost, Callahan wrote, “those celebrities who reacted publicly often did so with a pungent brew of self-pity, condescension and didacticism.”
Today, rather than pause and reflect, many Democrats, led by no less than Clinton, are attempting to deflect from the outcry over Weinstein and the long cover-up of his behavior by citing Trump – as if he is equally guilty. He is not.
Clinton, who is obviously conflicted on the subject as she has a history of targeting women who have accused her husband of sexual assault and of enabling the alleged serial abuser, actually said, “Look, we just elected someone who admitted sexual assault to the presidency.”
When I saw that comment, I was stunned to the point that I thought it might have been a spoof written by the Onion. The hypocrisy on display is stunning.
It is a sure sign of the Democrats’ detachment that they thought being surrounded by Hollywood’s liberal stars would deliver votes. In Clinton’s case, her appeal was so narrow that she began to rely on the rich and famous to not just provide extra flare at rallies, but also to actually be the headline attraction at her campaign events while she was just making an appearance on the sidelines.
So, what will the half-life of the Weinstein scandal’s impact be? Call me a cynic, but the Democrats will stick with Hollywood and there will be more Harvey Weinsteins. The Democrats need Hollywood and Hollywood is legendary for this behavior.
Some Democrats knew this about Weinstein, and it is safe to say they probably know it about others today. The Democrats tolerate it because they are convinced that the star power – and the money – is worth it.
The Democrats need the type of Hollywood show-ponies that Weinstein could control, in part because beyond criticizing Trump, Democrats really don’t have a lot to say. They have become beholden to the special interests of entertainment industry elites, trial lawyers, environmentalists and an assortment of groups with a grievance. The entertainment industry is a core part of the Democratic coalition. Period.
Yet Democrats are quickly moving on from the Weinstein scandal. While some have superficially distanced themselves from the now-disgraced mega-donor, the fact is that Democrats are largely holding on to his money.

0000793,The Story of This Man’s S*x Doll Being Stolen Is a Wild Ride From Start to Finish,"There are some seriously strange people on the planet. Unfortunately in today’s world, they are able to broadcast themselves on different social media outlets. Before our current technological advances, we knew they were out there, but we didn’t really see them much.
That’s all changed now and the weirdos of the world are everywhere. One man proves that when he explains the case of his missing adult doll. This story is wild and will leave you guessing until the very end. Check out the story.
Source: Instagram @b.l.o.themovie
The journey begins when one man posts a picture of his new friend. He claims he did not purchase the doll, but that instead she was given to him. I feel it’s important to mention that this man has a terrifying YouTube channel and I believe he is under the impression that he has fans. He seems be saying that the doll was given to him from an unknown fan.
It’s definitely a strange thing to post to Facebook.
Then, the unthinkable happens! Oh no, she has been stolen!
It would seem that an intruder had broken into this famous young man’s home and the only thing they took was his beloved doll.
He is alone and sad but luckily the police will keep him informed if they discover any information regarding this horrible crime.
Good news, the doll has been found! Bad news, she has been chopped to bits by a crazy meth addict/cook who was pulled over for a measly traffic violation!
Coincidentally, this perpetrator will be locked away for life due to the amount of meth discovered in his car!
Our guy is still very sad. “Gess” he don’t deserve “happyness.”
Now, for the truly unexpected ending.
This man (who is pictured above displaying his confidence) reveals that he, in fact was lying. He was eaten up with the guilt of his lie that he felt the only solution was for him to come clean. Do not forget, all of this he decided was appropriate to share on Facebook.
He revealed that he was actually “using” the doll when a terrible thing happened.
He must have been pounding away a bit too violently when her lady parts ripped in half. Thank god this man is using an object instead of a woman because he got so mad at the doll that he chopped it to pieces and threw it away.
Don’t worry— he apologized to his friends and fans for lying. He left us with this, “I was embarresed and Im sorry for lieing to friends and fans.”
Well, at least he apologized. Sound off in the comments and SHARE this creepy story!",unknown,False

0000795,Is feminism and women misandry for men just women showing their true faces for men?,"Now throughout history women have always had a need for men to provide, give protection for them, strength, ingenuity, get food for them, and help build society up for them. Many feminist like to argue that the lack of female inventors was due to male oppression but the thing is when human existence was young, there was no social structure or patriarch put in place and women had the same equal opportunity as men to come to the discovery of tools/make fire. Hell, a social experiment was done on survivors where men and women were serrated into 2 teams and men worked together to improve their living situation while women were left clueless and passively content with the way things are.
So the driving force for our society progression has been men in term of technological advances and males were still valued and needed and women because of this were submissive, showed respect and were kind to men.
Thanks to technological advances male physical strength is no longer needed as much by society, nor is male protection; a gun beats a big hulking man. Also seeing from the Western bubble we live in, many Western women will never experience the harsh effect of war or need a man to defend her against invaders which has only resulted in them no longer needing men as much. Thus, we see that in many aspect male duties that women once needed are no longer necessarily needed and this coincides right around the time in which feminism showed up.
With feminism women seem to have now showed their true face and feeling for men it seems and have varying levels of misandry for men. It is like a fake ass friend who is nice to you because they need you but once you are no longer needed reveal what they truly think about you.
Updates:
By the way for those saying i hate women, this is not about hate but just me making a question based on observation. Feminism came around the time, society was stabilised with plenty food/water/shelter, there was no war or need for physical strength and basically where many of the usefulness women had for men became ended up becoming less and less important. This question is just asking based on this coincidence.
Nah, lol, but misogyny is obviously poisoning brains of some weak and pathetic men who ignore the difference between feminism and feminazism:
As for the remark about communism and trump, I never mentioned either so I don't understand what your trying to say. If what I stated, if the organizations (which you neglected to address) and the protestors who are comprised of feminist (again you neglected to adress) if the intellectuals and the ones creating the philosophy and teaching it (which again you neglected to adress) are not actual feminist then what is a feminist and why would we call such a minority group within this particular group that has apparently completely different ideals and philosophies, feminist? What is a feminist then if not what I have presented?
@hellionthesagereborn I never asked for your opinion, I said I don't care what you think, I know what kind of idiots invented so-called ""straw argument"", that bullshit is used just because they don't know what else to say as a reply to an argument they can't win, so they promote they ""fallacy"" idiotism (calling it ""logic""), pretending to be ""smart"" by driveling Latin phrases, desperately trying to degrade other people with their egotism and annoying objections, but guess what, they always fail, or they get their asses kicked. Luckily for them, they are just ""internet warriors"", but in real life, they don't dare to face another person, they live like outcasts, in their parent's basements.Feminazi writers are not Feminists, I can say that I'm ""Alien"", or ""Doctor"", or ""Angel"" - but I'm not, Feminazis are just pretenders, not true Feminists.You can keep on living in your world of illusions, quasi-philosophy, and pseudo-intellectualism, but you'll never find a girlfriend that way
No whats happening is feminist and liberals have been conditioning women to hate men, its not inherint otherwise things would be much worse (look at the propaganda against men and then see that most women despite treating men poorly do not treat them nearly as bad as you would expect with how much they are represented as monsters). Its basically the same thing that happens to a spoiled child. When you don't hold them to a standard, when you don't punish them for wrong doing, when you tell them they are above every one else from birth and then have both parents and schools and society stating the exact same things, how women are now is inevitable. Men would turn out the same way too except no one would ever put men on a pedestal to the detriment of women, we are biologically as well as socially inclined to revere women and view men as disposable.",unknown,True

To that end, the committee dropped a new ad Tuesday aimed primarily at the web that tries to use the new news to motivate voters whose distaste for GOP presidential nominee
“It’s time to start asking why are Democrat Senate candidates still standing with Hillary Clinton?” the spot states. A montage then runs that includes Clinton meeting with Arab leaders, a smashed computer, and 1984-like footage that appears lifted from an old ad supporting President
“They already know about the smashed private email servers, sketchy meetings, shady political donations, special immunity deals,” the commercial continues.
“Now Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation… again,” it says, before noting that a pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, is backing the Democrats. (The ad is called “Priorities H.R.C.”)
“If these Democrat Senate candidates are letting her get away with these scandals now, just imagine what they would let Hillary Clinton get away in the White House, the spot concludes.
The FBI has still not suggested its latest review of the former secretary of state will change its earlier decision that she broke no laws, and there’s little evidence that Comey’s announcement has moved voters. But the NRSC at least thinks Comey’s move could help the GOP.
“Democrat Senate candidates across the country must now spend the last week of the campaign explaining to voters why they are so eager to vouch for Hillary Clinton’s honesty and trustworthiness,” said NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek.

0000806,The Oppression and Mass Execution of African-American Men will Cripple America,"The not guilty verdict and acquittal of all charges against George Zimmerman in the case of Trayvon Martin, the decision to not indict Cleveland Police Officers-Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback for the murder and the cover up shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, and the failure to indict ex-police officer Darren Wilson in the case of Mike Brown, along with other similar cases, have angered many people, largely because most people still feel that “justice” was not served in these cases.
Many believe these cases exhibit the state-sanctioned killings of young African-American men. In many ways, those who are offset by the murders are right. What we can all agree on is that the facts overwhelmingly show that all the mentioned cases are tragedies, without question! Many believe that race played a role in most, if not all, of these judgments. So, what does this demonstrate about our country’s ability ― or lack thereof ― to provide justice for all and protect it’s citizens? Let’s discuss these questions.
Let’s be honest, circumstantially most Black people believe they just don’t have the privileges or immunities of citizenship or due process ― of life, liberty or even equal protection of laws granted to other citizens (they are right in many ways). Within the African-American community, most, when asked, will say that they have never stopped being marginalized, criminalized and convicted for their skin color, beginning during slavery, and lasting into the economic and psychological era of slavery that we now call the new Jim Crow.
Strangely enough, there is a similarity between all these cases, but there are some lingering questions we must ask ourselves. We could ask, “Why would any police routinely be allowed take the life of citizens, time after time, and not abide by their public mandate, which is to ‘serve and protect?’” Today, we have questionable cases like Alton Sterling and others. The police murders keep stocking up, and for the most part, the only change around the country is that we are seeing more tragic cases of police murder everyday.
As a nation, did we fail?
Ultimately, some of these more disturbing questions will be answered by police internal affairs investigators, government officials and civic leaders. Other questions — the deeper, subliminal ones that ask about equality and intolerance — must be answered within our classrooms and our courtrooms. These deeper questions have now gone out from our living rooms and onto our televisions in our homes. Their very existence attests that we, as a black nation, have failed our Trayvon Martins, Mike Browns and our Tamir Rices, as well as all young black men.
Before his highly controversial death at the hands of a white police officer, Michael Brown had graduated from Normandy High School – a school whose academic standards and finances were so poor that it had been declared “unaccredited” by Missouri state education authorities.
During the 2011-2012 school year, 829 young black men and women were meted out one out-of-school suspension by Ferguson-Florissant.
However, Chief Charles Hurley of the Miami-Dade School Police Department (MDSPD) had implemented a policy in 2010 that reduced the number of criminal reports, manipulating statistics to create the appearance of a reduction in crime within the school system.
Less than two weeks before Martin’s death, the school system
Another
Deep rooted victim complexes.
Please Note: Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown both were not just victims of their seemingly racist killers alone. They all are victims of the lopsided school systems that failed them. They are victims of a police force that overwhelmingly assumes first that most young black men are criminals, thugs and near animals ― followed by an outright fear of them.
They are a victims of bad legislation, like the
They are victims of a certain moral blindness – which means every single black person, in the eyes of a racist, symbolizes a terrible crime from their ugly past, a reminder that their life is a fraud. These racists need to simply own up to their ugly past of slavery and make it right by society, instead of denying, shifting blame, lying, twisting the facts and making black people into these ungodly creatures that they look down on, laugh at and yet, oddly, fear.
This is a failed attempt to be at “peace,” with themselves. This must stop.
The truth will eventually surface.
We need more love in our communities! We need to love and accept our children unconditionally. Regardless of our child’s age, we have to instill feelings of acceptance and self-worth. Teach children, by how you treat them, that they are valuable and worthy of love. It doesn’t matter if you don’t agree with every choice or interest of your child.Tomorrow, look around your community, your home. Do you have any Trayvon Martins? As an educator, you have the power to stave off feelings of emptiness after another young Mike Brown’s death. Talk to your children about racism ― tell them that Tamir Rice was just an innocent child whose death was motivated by racism.
Question any legislation that endorses police vigilantism.
Nothing will fully fill the void created in the lost lives of Tamir, Trayvon and Mike for family, friends and teachers. But Tamir, Trayvon and Mike’s empty desks must become symbols of awareness and change — a sign to our society that the current state of affairs is not acceptable, and we won’t let racists, or anyone else, destroy us and our future without a fight!

“When it comes to the wall that Donald talked about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president, didn’t even raise it,” Clinton said, referencing a
Clinton dissed Trump’s visit with Peña Nieto in the course of an answer in which she portrayed herself as the much more humane candidate on immigration.
“I don’t want to rip families apart,” she said. “I don’t want to be sending parents away from children. I don’t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have four million American citizen children.”
Trump, for his part, initially seemed to confirm that he wanted to focus on deportation, saying that Mexican drug lords had to be rounded up, which has been a core theme of his campaign.
“We have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out,” Trump said.
But he glossed over his plans to deport as many other undocumented immigrants as possible. He also veered between arguing Clinton wants amnesty and an open border and insisting she wanted a wall along the southwest border and tying her to President Barack Obama’s deportation numbers. He was referring to Clinton’s vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which mandated the creation of hundreds of miles of border fencing that is still unfinished. Trump has said his border wall would be different from the fencing that currently exists ― in suggesting Clinton’s position was the same as his, he was really just arguing against his own claims that she opposes border security.
“Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts,” he said. “Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn’t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.”

0000813,"Miami-Dade Republican mayor condemns Trump's ""shithole"" comments | Miami Herald","Miami-Dade’s Republican mayor condemned as “shameful” President Donald Trump’s reported use of “shithole” to describe Haiti and other countries, releasing a sharp rebuke of a president who has singled out the mayor for praise from the White House.
“If true, President Trump’s remarks are very unfortunate and shameful,” Mayor Carlos Gimenez said in the statement issued after 10 p.m. Thursday.
No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story.
The statement came hours after first reports of Trump’s use of the vulgarity in an Oval Office discussion with senators about U.S. immigration policy. After mentions of protections for residents from Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations, Trump reportedly asked: “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” according to the Washington Post.
The Cuban-born Gimenez used his statement to highlight Miami-Dade’s immigrant-rich population, including one of the largest concentrations of former Haitian residents in the country.
“As Mayor of Miami-Dade County, I have personally experienced the contributions of the thousands of Haitian-Americans, Salvadorans and other residents from throughout the world who call our community home,” Gimenez said. “I can attest to their hopes to build better lives for their familes and their great contributions to our beautiful community and the United States.”

Gimenez has taken heat for accepting Trump’s demand that local governments detain immigration offenders booked on local criminal charges but otherwise free to go. Gimenez, who backed Hillary Clinton during his own reelection race in 2016, was the only big-city mayor to announce a change in policy to comply with Trump’s immigration crackdown just days after the new president took office. Gimenez’s dropping Miami-Dade’s “sanctuary” protections for immigration offenders prompted Trump to call him “Strong!” in a tweet.
Hours before Attorney General Jeff Sessions arrived in Miami to deliver an August speech praising Gimenez and Miami-Dade for its new detention policy, the mayor issued a statement criticizing Trump’s comments that seemed to minimize racist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va. Gimenez wrote there should be no “ambiguity” about the bigotry on display there.
I strongly condemn Mr. Trump’s comments about immigrants from El Salvador, Africa and Haiti not being suitable for admission into the United States. America has always stood for a... (Full post here:
It was the first statement issued from Gimenez’s office explicitly criticizing Trump, and the one issued Thursday on the president’s reported “shithole” comments is the second.
Also Thursday night, Miami’s new Republican mayor, Francis Suarez, condemned the president’s reported comments. “I strongly reject the denigrating comments attributed to the President this afternoon,” he wrote. “If true, they show a lack of respect and appreciation for vibrant and diverse cities like ours.”
Other county leaders reacted to Trump’s reported Oval Office comments, which included a demand that Haitians in particular not be included in any immigration deal. “Why do we need more Haitians?” Trump asked, according to accounts of the meeting reported by the Post and NBC News. “Take them out.” The White House issued a statement that did not deny the media reports, but emphasized the president’s determination to put America first.
Jean Monestime, Miami-Dade’s first Haitian-American county commissioner and a Democrat, posted a statement on Facebook that treated the president’s reported comments as fact.
“I strongly condemn Mr. Trump’s comments about immigrants from El Salvador, Africa and Haiti,” Monestime wrote. “Mr. Trump surely does not understand that what makes America Great is its diversity stemming from the immigration of the ‘poor, the tired and the huddled masses.’”
The Haitian community has added to the fabric that makes our community so unique and vibrant especially in South Florida. I’m proud to represent a diverse community from all backgrounds.
Esteban “Steve” Bovo, a Cuban-American Republican who succeeded Monestime as the commission’s chairman, issued a statement with praise for Haitians but no criticism for the president. “The Haitian community has added to the fabric that makes our community so unique and vibrant especially in South Florida,” Bovo wrote in a post on his chairman’s Twitter account. “I’m proud to represent a diverse community from all backgrounds.”",unknown,False

0000817,Liberty U. Students: ‘Donald Trump & Jerry Falwell Jr. Don’t Represent Us’,"Liberty University students want to be free — of their president’s surrogacy for Donald Trump. On Wednesday, a group of students calling themselves “
In the months since Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed him, Donald Trump has been inexorably associated with Liberty University. We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell’s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.
A majority of Liberty students, faculty, and staff feel as we do. Donald Trump received a pitiful 90 votes from Liberty students in Virginia’s primary election, a colossal rejection of his campaign. Nevertheless, President Falwell eagerly uses his national platform to advocate for Donald Trump. While he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials.
Associating any politician with Christianity is damaging to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But Donald Trump is not just any politician. He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.
The slow-motion suicide of the Religious Right — which has been very publicly conducted over the course of this election cycle — is, among much else, a product of distinctly generational loyalties. It’s no coincidence that most of the Evangelical leaders who have bent the knee to Trump are Baby Boomers:
But a much more confident faith is on display among younger Evangelical leaders — Russell Moore, for example, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Convention. These Liberty students are another example. Here’s how they end their statement:
We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. While our president Jerry Falwell Jr. tours the country championing the log in his eye, we want the world to know how many students oppose him. We don’t want to champion Donald Trump; we want only to be champions for Christ.

0000818,How Democrats Corrupt English to Create Hysteria,"Whenever passable Republican legislation materializes — a rarity these days — Democrats quickly warn that thousands, or perhaps even millions, of lives are at stake. Tax reform? Health care? Bogus international treaties? Internet regulations that were instituted only last year? It really doesn’t matter. Longstanding conservative ideas are not only wrong; they portend the end of America as we know it.
Why are liberals so apocalyptic and bellicose about tax reform (a rare cut that is, according to the sometimes-reliable Washington Post fact-checkers, only the eighth largest in history)? Well, everyone in politics tends to dramatize the consequences of policy for effect. A modern Democratic party drifting toward Bernie-ism, though, is far more likely to legitimately perceive any cuts in taxation as a limiting of state control, and thus an attack on all decency and morality. Taxation, after all, is the finest tool of redistribution. So it’s understandable.
But that’s not all of it. With failure comes frustration, and with frustration there is a need to ratchet up the panic-stricken rhetoric. It’s no longer enough to hang nefarious personal motivations on your political opponents — although it certainly can’t hurt! Good political activists must now corrupt language and ideas to imbue their ham-fisted arguments with some kind of basic plausibility. Many liberal columnists, for example, will earnestly argue that Republicans — who at this moment control the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the White House, thanks to our free and fair elections — are acting undemocratically when passing bills. As you know, democracy means raising taxes on the minority. What else could it mean?
But the most obvious and ubiquitous of the Left’s contorted contentions about the tax bill deliberately muddles the concept of giving and the concept of taking. This distortion is so embedded in contemporary political rhetoric that I’m not sure most of the progressive foot soldiers even think it’s odd to say anymore.
“You really shouldn’t lower everyone’s taxes, because it creates deficits and makes it harder to expand important programs like Medicaid” doesn’t have quite the same jolt as “You’re killing the poor!” And yet, whatever you make of the separate tax bills in the House and Senate, the authors are not taking one penny from anyone (unless you consider debt a tax on future generations, which doesn’t seem to be the case for either party). In fact, no spending is being cut (unfortunately). Not one welfare program is being given a block grant. Not one person is losing a subsidy. It’s just a traditional wide-ranging tax cut without any concurrent spending cuts.
To believe that taxing at a moderately lower rate is the same as “taking” from the poor, you must believe the following: Some arbitrary rates concocted by politicians many years ago for corporations, child credits, or deductions are now baselines that all future generations must hold sacred and/or the state has a natural right to your property, and whatever you keep is stolen from the collective.
Or, of course, you might just be extraordinarily dishonest. Because it’s perfectly legitimate and comprehensible to stake a position that argues that government has a duty to create a fairer nation by redistributing money from the well-off to the less fortunate.
Our progressive federal tax code already places most of the tax burden on the wealthy, but perhaps you believe they should pay more. I get it; you’re worried about income inequality. On the other hand, it is preposterous to claim — as many journalists have — that lowering rates across the board is a state-sponsored “transfer” of wealth. And no amount of pseudoscientific explainer charts will alter reality.
These perversions of basic language aren’t new, but they are becoming more prevalent.
For that matter, overturning the Obamacare mandate to purchase health insurance — a market coercion masquerading, for purely legal purposes, as a tax — does not mean that any Americans will have lost “access” to health-care insurance, as the vast majority of liberal pundits claim. That the Left deliberately confuses consumer choice with a lack of availability says something about its growing authoritarian inclinations. These perversions of basic language aren’t new, but they are becoming more prevalent. Democrats routinely refer to legal actions they disapprove of as “loopholes” and claim that conservatives are trying to “ban” contraception because they don’t want buying it to be a collective responsibility. These aren’t typical political euphemisms; these are a corrosion of language that we shouldn’t allow to be normalized.

0000819,The Ryan Lochte story just keeps getting weirder,"AMERICAN swimmer Ryan Lochte has changed elements of a story claiming he and fellow teammates were robbed at gunpoint by thieves impersonating police in Rio.
The 32-year initially claimed he was in a taxi with several members of the US swim team before they were pulled over, forced to the ground and had their wallets stolen. When he initially refused to lay down, Lochte said one of the robbers cocked a gun and put it against his head.
However, he has since changed tack slightly, reportedly telling NBC’s Matt Lauer they weren’t in fact pulled over, and he did not have a gun put to his head.
Instead, he said the swimmers had a gun pointed in their direction when they emerged from a petrol station rest room and tried to get into a taxi, only for the driver to prevent them from getting in.
He then claimed the driver refused to move before two men approached the car and told them to get on the ground. He stuck to his story about refusing to lay down while his teammates obliged, saying: “I have no reason to get on the ground.
“We wouldn’t make a story up. We’re victims in this,” Lochte reportedly told Lauer.
Matt Lauer on NBC says Ryan Lochte changed his story in call today. No longer says gun was put to his head, nor that they were pulled over
Lauer: Lochte now says they were ambushed after using gas stn restroom when cab driver refused to drive, gun was ""pointed in his direction""
As if the story couldn’t get more confusing, American sportscaster Bob Costas later interviewed Lauer about his interview with Lochte.
Lauer said the swimmer had altered parts of his story, but the guts of it remained true.
“He did (tweak his story),” Lauer said. “He stuck to most of the story. He did change one thing. I would say he softened some things, or stepped back.
“One thing he did not say this time — he didn’t say he was pulled over by these people pretending to be police.”
Lauer then told Costas why Lochte may have changed details about having a gun cocked to his head.
“I think he feels it was more of a traumatic mischaracterisation. I think people listening at home might think that it was an embellishment at the time, but that is up for people to decide.”
Earlier, Lochte had told NBC’s Billy Bush the robbers pulled out police badges when approaching him.
“I was with a couple of swimmers. We were coming back from a friend’s house. We got pulled over in our taxi. These guys came out with a badge, a police badge. No lights. No nothing. Just a police badge.
“They pulled us over. They pulled out their guns.”
Lochte’s story was called into question when footage emerged of the swimmers appearing to re-enter the Olympic Village with their wallets.
Yesterday a Rio judge ordered Lochte, Gunna Betz and Jack Conger’s passports be seized so they could be brought in for further questioning, suggesting there were doubts about the veracity of their claims.

Thousands of country music fans ran for cover Sunday night as a gunman fired hundreds of bullets at them from a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, officials said.
At least 527 people were hurt in the gunfire and ensuing stampede at the Jason Aldean concert, police said.
PHOTOS:
""About five feet from me, you could see a guy with a bullet wound right in his neck, motionless,"" witness Taylor Benge said. ""From there on ... people just started dropping like flies.""
Alexandria Cheplak, 25, called her father as she ran from the bullets.
""Everyone's dying around me,"" Jon Cheplak recalled her saying. ""Everyone's dying. They shot my friend ... I've got to get out of here.""
The gunman, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, unleashed a hail of bullets from the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Monday.
But why the massacre happened remains a mystery.
""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath,"" the sheriff said. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman described the gunman as ""a crazed lunatic full of hate.""
Latest developments
-- Police had no prior knowledge of the gunman before the attack, Sheriff Lombardo said. ""I don't know how it could have been prevented,"" he said.
-- Paddock bought multiple firearms in the past, but investigators believe the firearms were purchased legally, a law enforcement official said. The official said initial reports suggest at least one rifle was altered to function as an automatic weapon.
-- Police found 23 rifles inside Paddock's hotel room, Las Vegas police said.
-- 19 additional firearms were recovered from Paddock's home in Mesquite, Nevada. Law enforcement also found explosives, 1,000s of rounds of ammunition and electronic devices.
-- Law enforcement executed a search on Paddock's second home in northern Nevada, Lombardo said.
Festival turns into massacre
The massacre started around 10:08 p.m. Sunday (1:08 a.m. ET Monday) at the
Benge was enjoying the concert with his sister when he heard a relentless onslaught of ""200 to 300"" bullets.
""The firing went on forever,"" witness Kimberly Chilcote said.
She and her husband ran in short bursts -- sprinting and hiding to avoid being targeted.
""There were purses and shoes everywhere ... there were bodies and blood,"" she said. ""We just kept running.""
Benge lauded the heroics of his sister, who ""threw herself on top of me and said, 'I love you, Taylor,'"" he said.
""Even after an hour and 30 minutes, I didn't know if I was safe.""
Witness Bryan Hopkins said he survived by jumping into a walk-in freezer at the Mandalay Bay hotel.
And country singer Jake Owen, who was on stage with Aldean, said children were among the crowd.
""I saw kids on their parents' shoulders tonight,"" he said. ""This is something they'll never forget.""
The investigation
Police said they believe Paddock acted alone. ""Right now, we believe it's a sole actor, a lone-wolf-type actor,"" the sheriff said.
So far, the massacre has no known link to overseas terrorism or terror groups, a US official with knowledge of the case said.
And a woman who was described as a ""person of interest"" after the attack is now not believed to be involved in the shooting, police said in a statement.
""Marilou Danley is no longer being sought out as a person of interest,"" the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. ""LVMPD detectives have made contact with her and do not believe she is involved with the shooting on the strip.""
The gunman's brother, Eric Paddock, said he was stunned to learn Stephen was responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.
""We're still just completely befuddled. Dumbstruck,"" Eric Paddock said outside his home in Orlando, Florida.
He described his brother, a retired accountant, as ""a wealthy guy. He liked to play video poker. He went on cruises.""
The last time Eric Paddock spoke to his brother was when Stephen texted him, asking how their mother was doing after losing power from Hurricane Irma.
Eric Paddock said he knew his brother owned a few handguns and maybe one long rifle, but said he did not know of any automatic weapons.
Blood donations needed
With hundreds of victims still hospitalized, officials feared the death toll will keep rising.
The sheriff implored the community to donate blood. And before dawn Monday, throngs of donors had already lined up outside a blood bank.
Shanda Maloney tweeted a photo while she stood in line at 4:30 a.m.
""This. Is. Vegas. This is our community. These are our people. Thank you to everyone here donating,"" she tweeted.
Maloney told CNN she also gave transportation to anyone who needed it after the attack.
""I just started picking people up and giving people rides,"" she says.
Aldean speaks out
Aldean posted a statement on Instagram saying that he and his crew were safe.
""My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night. #heartbroken#stopthehate,"" he wrote.
Two Las Vegas police officers are being treated at a hospital after they were injured during the shooting, Lombardo said. One is in critical condition, and the other had minor injuries.
""Pray for Las Vegas,"" Mayor Goodman tweeted. ""Thank you to all our first responders out there now.""
Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said on Twitter that a ""tragic &amp; heinous act of violence has shaken the #Nevada family"" and offered prayers to all those affected by ""this act of cowardice.""
'We just ran for our lives'
Rachel De Kerf filmed her escape from the venue using her cell phone, starting just after the first shots were fired.
She described ongoing gunfire, and played out the video she had recorded during which more than five minutes of gunfire were intermittently audible.
""The gunshots lasted for 10-15 minutes. It didn't stop,"" she said. ""We just ran for our lives.""
De Kerf's sister, Monique Dumas, said that everyone instantly crouched when they heard the shots.
""The band was rushed off the stage, the floodlights came on the crowd, and you see on the right hand of the stage the person who was injured, so they're calling for medics, calling for security, then there was gunfire again,"" Dumas said.
'Go, go, go'
SiriusXM Country radio host Storme Warren was on the side of the stage as Aldean was performing when the shots rang out.
""I thought it was fireworks going off and maybe it mistriggered, and then it happened again. And when it happened the third time, we knew something was wrong,"" Warren said.
""The shells were hitting the deck of the stage when I was on it,"" he said, adding that he could still hear the shells as he went under the stage for protection.
""It seemed there was a pause in the gunfire and the people in the yellow shirts were telling the people to 'go, go, go, go' ... the gunfire never ended, it seemed like it went on and on and on,"" Dumas said.
A concertgoer told CNN affiliate KLAS that everybody was lying on top of each other trying to get out of the shooter's way.
""My husband and I ran out toward our car, and there were people hiding underneath my car for cover,"" she said.
""There was a gentleman who was shot and he said, 'Can you help me?' And so I put him in my car and I had like six people in my car, people without shoes, running, just to get away.""
'Like shooting fish in a barrel'
Audio of the shooting suggested that the shooter had used a military-style weapon, CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano said.
""Automatic weapon(s) like that -- had to be numbers of magazines or a very large drum, it sounded to me like a belt-fed weapon, a military-style weapon and then to be shooting down, to use the analogy, it was like shooting fish in a barrel in that space,"" Gagliano said.
MGM Resorts, which owns the Mandalay Bay, tweeted its condolences.
""Law enforcement and emergency personnel responded quickly to the incident and secured the scene,"" it said in a statement. ""Law enforcement requested that we put hotels in the vicinity on lockdown to ensure guest safety. We will provide more information as it becomes available.""
Later, Lombardo said guests at Mandalay Bay could return to their rooms. Police had completed the search of Paddock's room at the resort, he said.

0000821,Bill O’Reilly Uses Anti-Semitic Dog Whistles Against George Soros To Hit Media Matters,"Bill O’Reilly sank to new lows last night when he attacked liberal philanthropist George Soros with anti-Semitic dog whistles. O'Reilly called Soros “the shadow puppet master behind corrupt far-left groups like Media Matters” and said he “has his tentacles into political organizations.” This, as Media Matters has been hammering O’Reilly over his many fabrications that have been uncovered recently.
But first, O’Reilly used another, racial dog whistle to suggest President Obama is an uber welfare queen.
It all happened in O’Reilly’s Talking Points commentary last night. It purported to be about the “Blockupy” protests in Frankfurt, Germany. Or, as O’Reilly said, “anti-capitalist violence on display.”
But as with just about any subject on Fox, it wasn’t long before O’Reilly exploited this news story to go after Democrats. First, Obama:
O'REILLY: And it all comes back to the same thing: private enterprise being strangled by big government spending and regulations. Entitlements, free stuff, giving people the means to live—giving it to them, rather than having them earn their way.
Here in America, President Obama is sympathetic to the big government economic intrusion.
Then Soros - after a swipe at Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders:
O'REILLY: We do have a quasi-socialistic senator in Elizabeth Warren, who if Hillary Clinton goes down, could compete in the Democratic sweepstakes for president.

0000822,Fox’s Earhardt: Trump’s Tweets Prove He’s Perfect For Dealing With N. Korea And Russia,"Fox &amp; Friends ignored the gift to Vladimir Putin that Donald Trump offered up during his press conference in Poland today. Instead cohost Ainsley Earhardt argued that Trump's attacks on American media make him ""the kind of guy you're going to want"" going up against North Korea and Putin.
We can just imagine the Fox &amp; Friends poutrage we’d have seen this morning if President Barack Obama attacked Fox News, our intelligence agencies and former President George W. Bush on foreign soil. But since it was Dear Leader Donald Trump attacking CNN, MSNBC, the intelligence community and Obama, it was all part of presidential Awesomeness!
During his press conference in Poland, Trump made childish, vindictive and narcissistic comments when asked about his
TRUMP: I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them. As you know, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time. They have been covering me in a very, very dishonest way.
[…]
NBC is equally as bad, despite the fact that I made ‘em a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.
I’m old enough to remember when Fox
EARHARDT: It’s interesting, after a 15 minute press conference, the reporter stands up, and the first question is about North Korea and he coupled that with that CNN question about the wrestling video. It’s like, come on, can we talk about the issues?
On Fox, “talking about the issues” means praising Trump more substantively. So Kilmeade jumped in to argue that the Tweet was no reflection on Trump’s Awesome Things-That-Matter Awesomeness.
KILMEADE: I know you guys have thought about this, but hopefully people at home have put this together. I know the president comes out and he puts out these videos and people think, “that’s unpresidential” or “this is not right” or “this is different, why is he tweeting that?” But in the big picture, when things matter, when it comes to international security and world war, like North Korea, when it comes to relations with Russia, when it comes to the Middle East and Syria and ISIS, he is cool and calculated like a 40-year diplomatic veteran. Look at North Korea. We might have to take some very tough action against North Korea. He isn’t saying, “This little clown has no right doing this, he was given”—he’s being very cool and calculated and very—and parses his speech because he knows the impact. [Transcript excerpt via
But that wasn’t quite enough Trump Awesomeness for Earhardt. She suggested that Trump’s Tweets were an integral part of Dear Leader’s Magnificence:
EARHARDT: Well, the very reason that the left doesn’t like him is because he’s not going to be intimidated. He will put these videos out there to say this is fake news. Yet, that’s the kind of guy that you’re going to want to represent the United States of America when he does have to come up against North Korea, when he does have to have talks tomorrow with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. [Transcript excerpt via
Then cohost Steve Doocy played the clip that contained Trump's gift to Putin. It was in response to NBC’s Hallie Jackson asking Trump if he would “definitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.”
Trump’s answer was mind boggling. First, he equivocated, saying he thinks it was Russia but “it could have been” other countries, which undoubtedly pleased Putin
So how did the Curvy Couch Cheerleaders respond? First, by showing a large banner that said, “THE MEDIA’S RUSSIAN OBSESSION.”
Then cohost Doocy said contemptuously that Jackson had tried to ask a third question, despite the rules only allowing two. “Time ran out,” he sneered.

Soap manufacturers Dove have issued an apology on Twitter and Facebook after a blatantly racist Facebook advert went viral and became the target of justified consumer rage this weekend.
The advert was released on Saturday (October 7) and showed a static compilation of four photos. The first frame shows a black woman in a bathroom with a bottle of Dove body wash in the corner. The frames then show the woman reach down, lift her shift off to reveal a smiling white woman.
The ad has now been removed from Facebook but Twitter users have been resurfacing the images along with Dove’s previously insensitive campaigns.
The soap brand issued a small apology on Twitter that reads: “An image we recently posted on Facebook missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully. We deeply regret the offense it caused”.
Unilever, Dove’s parent company, have not responded to comment requests from Washington Post.
Dove consumers took particular offence to what “missed the mark” pertains to. “What exactly were y’all going for?,” one self-described Dove consumer said on the company’s Facebook page. “What was the mark … I mean anyone with eyes can see how offensive this is.

0000827,FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation,"The FBI has been quietly investigating the Clinton Foundation for months, reviving a probe that was dialed back during the 2016 election amid tensions between Justice Department prosecutors and FBI agents about the politically charged case, according to people familiar with the matter.
The investigation is being run out of the FBI’s field office in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the foundation has offices in the William J. Clinton Presidential Center, the people said. Agents are trying to determine if any donations made to the foundation were linked to official acts when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, these people said.
It was not immediately clear what specific donations or interactions agents were scrutinizing, and there was some skepticism inside both the Justice Department and the FBI that the case would ultimately lead to any charges.
The very existence of such a probe will likely lead to accusations from Democrats that the Republican administration is pursuing old, dead cases to punish political enemies.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and her aides. But while the Clinton Foundation investigation was effectively stopped in 2016, that stoppage at the time was described by people familiar with the matter as temporary because Justice Department officials were concerned that if details of the probe were to become public, it would appear that investigators were trying to hurt Clinton’s chances in the election.
In a statement, Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said: “Time after time, the Clinton Foundation has been subjected to politically motivated allegations, and time after time these allegations have been proven false. None of this has made us waver in our mission to help people. The Clinton Foundation has demonstrably improved the lives of millions of people across America and around the world while earning top ratings from charity watchdog groups in the process. There are real issues in our society needing attention that the Clinton Foundation works hard to solve every day. So we’re going to stay focused on what really matters.”
Republicans, in particular, have long raised concerns about what they viewed as corruption and conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation, in particular Hillary Clinton’s dealings with its donors while she was secretary of state.
The Clinton Foundation probe dates back to 2015, when FBI agents in Los Angeles, New York, Little Rock and Washington, began looking at a variety of different figures who had made donations to the charity, based largely on news accounts, according to people familiar with the matter. In 2016, Justice Department prosecutors rejected a request from FBI agents to expand and intensify the foundation investigation, these people said.
Republican lawmakers had called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions in July and again in September to explore various Clinton Foundation dealings, as well as other matters, by appointing a special counsel to look into Clinton-related issues. In November, the Justice Department wrote that Sessions would direct senior prosecutors to look into the cases about which they raised concerns and hinted that some might already be under investigation.
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that part of what the department would do was assess whether “any matters currently under investigation require further resources,” though he said his letter should not be construed as confirming or denying any probe.
By that time, according to the people familiar with the matter, agents were already investigating the Clinton Foundation.
The Clinton Foundation inquiry is separate from the FBI’s high-profile investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, though Republicans have said that probe, too, needs to be reopened. The email investigation focused on whether Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information by using the private server. Then-FBI Director James Comey recommended in July 2016 the case be closed without charges, and though work on it briefly resumed in October - soon before the presidential election - he ultimately did not change his mind, and the Justice Department endorsed his recommendation.
Justice Department officials have said senior prosecutors are also reviewing investigative records on the Clinton email case to see if any of the concerns raised by Republican lawmakers merit appointment of a special counsel for further investigation.
The Clinton Foundation has raised billions of dollars since it was formed and generally receives high marks from philanthropy watchdog organizations. But, because of its global donor base and Hillary Clinton’s former position as America’s top diplomat, it also faced questions about contributions from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Algeria.",unknown,False

0000837,American-born Muslims more likely than Muslim immigrants to see negatives in U.S. society,"While Muslims born in the United States and their immigrant counterparts share a pride in being American, U.S.-born Muslims are less likely than immigrants to feel comfortable with their place in broader American society.
Muslim immigrants and those born in the U.S. both overwhelmingly express pride in their national identity. About nine-in-ten U.S.-born (90%) and foreign-born (93%) Muslims say they are proud to be American, according to a 2017
Like the larger American public, majorities of both U.S.-born Muslims and Muslim American immigrants say they believe people who want to get ahead can do so with hard work (65% and 73% respectively). Roughly six-in-ten of all Americans (62%) share this belief.
However, U.S.-born Muslim Americans are less likely than immigrants to perceive positive feelings from their fellow Americans. Indeed, just three-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims say the American people are friendly toward Muslim Americans, compared to 73% of immigrants who feel this way.
And U.S.-born Muslims are more likely than their immigrant counterparts to say there is discrimination against Muslims, and to say they have personally experienced at least one of several specific types of discrimination, such as people acting suspicious of them or calling them offensive names, being singled out by airport security or by some other law enforcement, or being physically attacked or threatened.
Nine-in-ten (91%) U.S.-born Muslims say there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims, compared with 65% of immigrants who say this. And six-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims (61%) say that in the past 12 months they have experienced at least one of the specific types of discriminatory behavior asked about in the survey, compared with 39% of immigrants who say this. As might be expected, those who have personally experienced discrimination are more likely to say that there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims.
U.S.-born Muslims also are more likely than immigrants to say that political institutions are unfriendly toward their group. For instance, most U.S.-born and foreign-born Muslims say the Democratic Party is “friendly” or “neutral” toward Muslim Americans, but immigrant Muslims are particularly likely to feel this way. Likewise, U.S.-born Muslims are more likely to say the Democratic Party is unfriendly (23%) than foreign-born Muslims (5%).
And while many U.S. Muslims say that the Republican Party is unfriendly toward Muslim Americans, seven-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims hold this view, while only half of foreign-born Muslims say this.

0000838,The biggest moments of racism in 2017 | Solomon Jones,"In 2017, racism not only won the day. It won the year.
That’s my takeaway from a 12-month span that saw America inaugurate a president who ran on a hate-filled platform that denigrated and demeaned anyone who was not a white male. Some would say that another -ism — sexism — was the watchword for 2017. But I would argue that
For those who doubt the veracity of that statement, I offer you the four biggest moments in racism from the year 2017.
The January ceremony was the crowning achievement of a candidate who replaced the veiled racism of past presidential hopefuls with the overt bigotry of a man who doesn’t give a damn.
Trump understood the racial resentment that many Americans harbored after eight years under Barack Obama, America’s first black president, and Trump used it to his advantage. Having benefited from five years of peddling the racist lie that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore unqualified to be president, Trump repeatedly returned to the well of racism.
Trump asserted that undocumented Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals. Trump proposed that Muslims — most of whom are black and brown — should be banned from the United States. Trump said a judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump’s company could not rule fairly because of the judge’s Mexican heritage, prompting House Speaker Paul Ryan to say, “
But Ryan still backed Trump for president, as did the vast majority of the GOP. That’s what led to the inauguration of Donald Trump, and paved the way for the normalization of racism.
In January, shortly after his inauguration, Trump penned an executive order that he said was focused on keeping America safe from terrorists. But
The ban initially applied to travelers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. It also permanently banned refugees from Syria.
For those keeping score, these countries are primarily composed of black and brown people. And none of these countries is Chechnya, home to the white Muslims who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing. After various court battles over the ban, the Trump administration fashioned a third version that included North Korea and Venezuela — two non-Muslim countries. The Supreme Court then allowed the travel ban to be implemented while court challenges continue.
That, my friends, tells everyone who’s watching that in the eyes of America, terrorists are only black and brown people who practice certain religions.
Nothing says racism like a Justice Department decision to “review” consent decrees calling on police departments to change their patterns of abusing black people.

That’s an interesting viewpoint. Here’s mine: Nothing lowers morale more than being shot dead by a police officer because your skin color was perceived as a threat.
Nor can I imagine the president of the United States saying both sides are to blame when violence erupts from such a march, yet that’s what Donald Trump said in 2017 — the year that race relations went backward.
Trump said anti-racism protesters were partly to blame for the Charlottesville violence even after 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed. She died when reputed neo-Nazi sympathizer James Fields, 20, allegedly drove his car into a crowd of anti-racism protesters. Fields was subsequently charged with first-degree murder in Heyer’s death.
The fact that Heyer was a white woman is significant, because her willingness to stand up against white supremacists tells an irrefutable truth: Not everyone is a racist.
And that fact, more than anything else I saw in 2017, gives me hope. It tells me that perhaps things can change as America drags the heavy weight of racism into a new year.

YOUNGSTERS are being reminded what to do if caught up in a terrorist attack in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting.
The mass shooting at the Mandalay Bay Hotel left 59 people dead and another 527 injured.
Police are still working to establish the motive behind the attack despite Islamic State having claimed responsibility.
Gunman Stephen Paddock, aged 64, opened fire from from a 32nd floor window of the hotel towards the open-air country
Last week, Counter Terrorism Police in the UK launched a new safety campaign directed at 11 to 16-year-olds, teaching them what to do if they are caught in a gun or knife terror attack.
Advice includes not to stop and use their phone until they are safely away from danger.
The campaign is using celebrities, including TV star Bear Grylls and England footballer Jamie Vardy, to try and get the message across.
The UK terror level is still at severe and the advice to children is to run if they are able to do so, hide if they are not and to tell the police of the threat only when it is safe to do so.
Children are also being advised to warn others about an ongoing threat and not to stop and use their phones until they are safely away from danger.
Previous counter terrorism campaigns have been directed at adults but new age-appropriate safety advice is now being given out to engage with young people.
The NSPCC, Childline and Educate against Hate has team up with the National Counter Terrorism Security Office to help and support parents.
The campaign was launched following the Manchester Arena bombing, where children were targeted, and attacks in London.
National lead for protective security, deputy assistant commissioner Lucy D’Orsi, said: “We appreciate that talking to young people about terrorism can be scary, for parents and children alike.
“But the atrocities in London and Manchester have sadly resulted in some of the youngest victims of terror this country has ever seen, and if we are able to teach children to act in a way which could potentially save their lives then it is our responsibility to do so.
“We are particularly concerned when we see people – young and old – using their mobiles to film scenes when they should be moving away from the danger. The recent incident in Parsons Green is a good example of this.
“Our research showed that many young people think filming would be a good thing to provide evidence for police. We must get them to understand that the priority must be their safety.”
Later phases of the campaign will launch the messaging at youth groups such as the Scouts, Guides and Cadets.",unknown,False

This week’s leaks show
Ms. Tanden runs the Center for American Progress, the think tank that is essentially an arm of the Clinton campaign. CAP’s former chief, John Podesta,is now the Clinton campaign chairman, and on June 2, 2015 Ms. Tanden sent an email to Jake Sullivan, a key Clinton aide, copying Mr. Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri, another campaign operative.
The subject line was “King v. Burwell,” the second big legal case contesting the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, three years after the first case in which the Chief sided with the four liberals to uphold the law.
Ms. Tanden wrote that, “As Jennifer will remember, it was pretty critical that the President threw the gauntlet down last time on the Court, warning them in the first case that it would politicize the role of the Court for them to rule against the ACA. As a close reader of the case, I honestly believe that was vital to scaring Roberts off.”
It worked so well the first time that they were considering doing it again in King v. Burwell, this time through Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign:
In her June 2015 email, Ms. Tanden recommended to her Clinton colleagues that they do the same thing again. “I’m not arguing that Hillary spend a lot of time attacking the Court,” she writes. “I do think it would be very helpful to all of our interest in a decision affirming the law, for [Chief Justice] Roberts and perhaps [Justice Anthony] Kennedy to see negative political consequences to ruling against the government. Therefore, I think it would be helpful to have a story of how progressives and Hillary would make the Supreme Court an election issue (which would be a ready argument for liberals) if the Court rules against the government.”",unknown,True

0000844,Trump Threatens to Deal Another Blow to the Palestinian Cause,"By cutting off hundreds of millions in American aid to the Palestinian Authority, the president could radically alter the Middle East.
President Trump set off another Twitter firestorm last week when he hinted that he may be considering cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in annual U.S. aid to the Palestinians. Trump was angered over Palestinian unwillingness to engage in peace talks with Israel after the Trump administration announced the move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
Given that the U.S. channels its Palestinian aid through third-party United Nations organizations, it’s unclear how much money Trump is talking about it. But in total it may exceed $700 million per year, according to reports.
A decade ago, the U.S. row with the Palestinian Authority would have been major news. But not now.
Why?
The entire Middle East has radically changed — and along with it the role and image of the Palestinians.
First, the U.S. is now one of the largest producers of fossil-fuel energy in the world. America is immune from the sort of Arab oil embargo that in 1973–74 paralyzed the U.S. economy as punishment for American support of Israel. Even Israel, thanks to new offshore oil and natural-gas discoveries, is self-sufficient in energy and immune from Arab cutoffs.
Second, the Middle East is split into all sorts of factions. Iran seeks to spread radical Shiite theocracy throughout Iraq and Syria and into the Persian Gulf states — and is the greatest supporter of Palestinian armed resistance. The so-called “moderate” Sunni autocracies despise Iran. Understandably, most Arab countries fear the specter of a nuclear Iran far more than they do the reality of a democratic and nuclear Israel.
A third player — radical Islamic terrorism — has turned against the Arab status quo as well as the West. Because Palestinian organizations such as Hamas had flirted with Iran and its appendages (such as the terrorists of Hezbollah), they have become less useful to the Arab establishment. The terrorist bloodlettings perpetrated by groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda have discredited terror as a legitimate means to an end in the eyes of the Arab world, despite previous support for Palestinian terrorists.
Third, the world itself may have passed the Palestinian issue by.
Israel was founded in 1948. Palestinian rhetoric that they would push the Jews into the sea is by now stale. There have been seven decades of failed intifadas and suicide-bombing campaigns, along with full-scale Arab–Israeli wars.
Equally futile were endless “peace processes,” “peace initiatives,” “road maps,” and “multiparty talks,” plus Middle East “conferences,” “summits,” and “memoranda” all over the world, from Madrid and Oslo to Camp David.
In the meantime, most other “refugees” the world over have long ago moved on. Around the time Israel was created, some 13 million German speakers were ethnically cleansed from East Prussia and Eastern Europe. The word “Prussia” no longer exists as a geographical or national label. Seven decades later, the grandchildren of refugees do not replay World War II. “Prussians” do not talk about reclaiming their ancestral homelands in present-day Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. German-speaking youth do not demand a “right of return” to their grandparents’ homes to the east.
Fourth, the Palestinians have never been able to craft a successful, transparent, consensual government. After 30 years of waiting, the world has mostly given up on their rhetoric of self-government and reform on the West Bank.
Since the Palestinian proclamation of independence in 1988, there have been only two “presidents”: Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas. Neither has allowed open and transparent elections. A Palestinian president gets power by seizing it. He loses it only by dying in office. Over the same period, Israel has elected seven different prime ministers from a variety of political parties.
The Palestinian political party Fatah is engaged in a deadly rivalry with the terrorist-inspired Hamas organization that has run Gaza for over a decade. The beef is not over democracy, but over which faction will bury the other.
The Palestinians’ inability to rule the West Bank in constitutional fashion is why hundreds of thousands of expatriate Palestinians voice their solidarity from a safe distance while living in North America or Europe. More than a million Palestinians prefer to stay put in Israel. They are convinced that they will have more security, freedom, and prosperity in a democratic state than under dictatorial Palestinian rule a few miles away.
Trump may be rash and unfamiliar with the stagnant Middle East peace process, but his political instincts are probably correct. Polls show that less than 20 percent of Americans support the Palestinian cause. Many U.S. citizens are tired of subsidizing those who claim that they do not like their benefactors in the United States.
It finally may be time for the Palestinian factions to fund their own causes and go their own ways.

0000845,Trump Can Fix It,"It is hard to believe that this clangorous campaign of defamations is in its last week. Of course, in the first year of Donald Trump’s largely self-financed campaign, which broke all records for the sale of silly T-shirts, hats, and badges, his pandering was sometimes outrageous, but it was brilliant. As Senator Marco Rubio said as he bowed out of the race, having been bombed in his home state of Florida by Trump by nearly a million votes, “There was a tsunami approaching and only Mr. Trump saw it.”
The political class that had admitted 12 million illegal immigrants, while waffling about “comprehensive immigration reform” and doing nothing, complacently assumed that the country had acquiesced in this cynical outrage. After all, someone had to do the menial work in the U.S. It was a pandemic of almost terminal hypocrisy and when Donald Trump focused national attention on it, he had to be defamed as a racist. Donald Trump has a big mouth and a loose tongue, but he has, unlike many of his accusers, a perfect record as an equal-opportunity employer, and there is not a scintilla of evidence that he is a racist.
He was probably correct that the judge of whom he complained was biased, but was unrigorous and very ungracious in imputing this to his ancestry. Mr. Trump is a great talent, but rigor and grace, like modesty, are not at the forefront of his fine qualities. Not as easily dismissed are Mr. Trump’s attacks on several of the free-trade agreements in place or contemplation. He has no problem with Canada as a fair-trading partner of comparable per capita wealth to the United States, and offered the United Kingdom a free-trade deal with minimal negotiations if it does depart the European Union as it has voted to do.
What he objects to are free-trade agreements that amount to the importation of unemployment into the United States. There is nothing intellectually wrong with this; the desire of all Americans for cheaper goods and natural resources and agricultural products should be balanced against the interests of the U.S. work force. This is not a euphemism for protectionism that allows uncompetitive American enterprises to milk a tariff-insulated market. This was the greatest and most continuous political issue in the United States from the Civil War to the end of World War II, and Trump does not deserve to be branded as a Luddite guardian of feather-bedding and monopolistic practices.
Just as outrageous was the portrayal of Trump as a misogynist. His personal conversation is less coarse than Mrs. Clinton’s, and the tape of his exchange eleven years ago with Billy Bush (of the ubiquitous Bushes), while repulsive, was not how he speaks. He shut Hillary down for months by pointing out that she was an enabler of the most egregious “objectifier” of women in American presidential history, and her campaign waited until they must have thought it unanswerable to drop this fragmentation grenade. Trump apologized for his comments, and entered the second presidential debate under greater pressure than anyone in the history of these exchanges, going back to Kennedy and Nixon in 1960. His campaign was disintegrating. An inconvenient fact, which the Washington media chose not to recognize, is that he overcame the Bush-tape disaster and won the last two debates; qualities of leadership do lurk beneath his efflorescent egotism.
This election has not been so dismal in policy terms. Mrs. Clinton, thanks to the unelected party grandees who are ex officio delegates — the same people who sandbagged her eight years ago in favor of Obama — narrowly beat off a cuckoo challenge from a democratic Marxist. Senator Sanders was magnificently correct in excoriating the essentially totalitarian American prosecutorial system, and even in his objections to excessive concessions to Wall Street engineers of the velocity of money, but his general tax policy, neutral-isolationist foreign policy, and trenchant clamping of his lips around the (unnatural) gas-pipe of global warming, made him an implausible candidate. And Donald Trump, while recruiting the blue-collar reactionaries and bringing them back into the political system after decades of sullen abstention, favors universal health care and a generous hand to disadvantaged African Americans. Both candidates have a sane foreign policy, which would steer between the mindless interventionism of George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s Panglossian appeasement of America’s enemies.
In England, in the last two weeks, I engaged in three widely publicized debates about the U.S. election. The British public largely clings to the view that the United States is a useful oaf of a country of philistines which occasionally tosses up “one of us” like FDR or JFK, and my audiences had drunk the anti-Trump Kool Aid. I opened each time by predicting that there would not be, because there could not be, any argument for the reelection of the Democrats. Their only campaign has been to smear Trump, whose antics have made him an easy target. Because George H.W. Bush was the only president since Theodore Roosevelt who had sons with an aptitude for politics, and Bill Clinton was the only president since Franklin Roosevelt who had a wife with an aptitude for politics, those two families held one of the three greatest public offices in the country for 32 years from 1981 to 2013, and have handed these positions back and forth between each other. Coincidentally, the last 20 years have been the worst period of presidential misgovernment in the country’s history, surpassing even the twelve years before the Civil War, and between Wilson and FDR.
Practically all commentators predicted a race of polemical vehemence unlike any since 1800, when Thomas Jefferson exchanged slanders and libels with John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, and the shadowy maneuverer Aaron Burr almost emerged as president. It was always going to be portrayed as a race between the grotesque caricatures of the Ugly American braggart and materialist and the sleazeball superannuated feminist. When it became clear that Trump had tapped into an electoral geyser (which to me was when he took 49 percent of the minority Republican vote in the arch-liberal state of Massachusetts in a 14-candidate race), and that he would be nominated, it was also clear that he would, in the words of George Wallace nearly 50 years ago, shake the political class “by the eyeteeth.” It is often hard not to adapt to Trump FDR’s comment on his mentor and rival, Alfred E. Smith, that he “loved him for his enemies.”
Trump is the only person who might clean out this Augean stable.
In the end, the majority of Americans could be persuaded not to vote for Trump, as the candidate not complicit in the decline of America these past 20 years, only if they were so horrified by his vulgarity that they overlooked the poor performance of the Bush-Clinton-Obama regency and the ethical frailties of the Democrats. Trump’s offenses are matters of taste, not indictable transgressions, and the revolt of the FBI against the sleazy straddle of Director James Comey’s verbal condemnation of Mrs. Clinton as a perjurer while declining to indict her has blown the race open. Mrs. Clinton has tried to ignore the revelations that her chief aide, Huma Abedin, may have perjured herself, as she has ignored the FBI director’s assertion that she herself lied under oath. She merely “short-circuited” her FBI interrogators. Rabid partisans like James Carville and Tim Ryan have claimed a conspiracy between the Kremlin, the FBI, Trump, and nameless hobgoblins. It was like Alexander Haig’s conjuration of an “unknown spirit” that erased Rosemary Woods’s Watergate tape in 1973. Trump’s manager, Kellyanne Conway, accurately explained why what has occurred is more odious than Watergate. Richard Nixon, an outstanding president, was crucified, though he never lied under oath and there is no convincing evidence that he personally broke any laws. It is time to write history, including current history, straight.
The sadness of Peggy Noonan that the country has been let down by inferior candidates is understandable, but fails to credit Trump for unerringly following a trail no one saw: First he was Archie Bunker, then a lightning rod for excessive abuse, then impresario of the revelation of intolerable ethical strains in the Clinton campaign. Less creditable are the intelligent commentators like Daniel Henninger, who denounced the Hillary Clinton administration as if recounting history, Franklin Pierce or Warren Harding — implicitly expressing anger that Trump wasn’t a respectable enough Republican candidate to deny the move into the White House of the Clinton pay-to-play casino. And most distasteful of all are the sanctimonious conservative intellectuals who departed Trump to legitimize the Clinton sleaze factory, with the feigned majesty of those who felt entitled to name the Republican candidate, and whose public twitches and reflections were bound to shape the intellectual conscience of America. The friendship of decades with many of them prevents my mentioning names. The worst of them are those who accused Trump of fascistic tendencies and even of anti-Semitism. Everyone upon whom the country had the right to rely has failed: the traditional party elders, the national media, the conservative intellectuals, the engineers and conductors of the great liberal gravy train.
In the last week of this tumultuous campaign, Donald Trump, however raucous his delivery, has emerged as the candidate of comparative integrity, and the only person who might clean out the Augean stable of the American political system. Unless Hillary Clinton, whose considerable gifts have never included an excess of spontaneous originality, can pull from the tattered Democratic hat a miraculous Brobdingnagian bunny, the doors of the White House will be opened to the greatest, if far from the most elegant, personal political crusade in American history.

Black Lives Matter leader Shaun King won a full-ride scholarship intended for black men from Oprah Winfrey to attend college.
The 35-year-old is a high profile social activist, campaigning against police brutality towards African Americans, the New York Post reported.
King, who says he is the son of a Caucasian mother and an African-American father, has written extensively about racial tensions he experienced while growing up.
But an investigative blogger has come forward accusing King of being a fraud and claiming he is actually 100% white, Breitbart reported.
Vicki Pate, from the Re-NewsIt blog, claims to have probed King's family tree and alleges that his birth certificate lists his father, Jeffery Wayne King, as being white, not black.
His place of birth is reportedly listed as Versailles, Kentucky - where only one Jeffery Wayne King apparently lives in the entire state.
Police mugshots following multiple arrests of a man of the same name show he is clearly Causcasian, the blogger claims.

Residents who are reluctant to evacuate have been told they and their family 'could die' as the killer storm barrels towards the Atlantic coast.
Experts have warned the powerful
Florida Governor Rick Scott told residents who had not evacuated yesterday their 'time is up', with the storm set to bring winds of 120mph.
He said: ""To everyone on Florida's east coast, if you are reluctant to evacuate, just think of all the people the Hurricane has already killed.
""You and your family could be among these numbers if you don't take this seriously.""

Meanwhile, a Fox News reporter warned viewers that if Matthew moves 20 miles to the west: ""You're going to die. And your kids are going to die too.""
Martin County Sheriff William Snyder also emphasised the strength of the Category 3 hurricane, which has been deemed the biggest storm in a century.
He told NBC: ""People do not seem to get it and are not leaving. I'm not saying this to be theatrical ... I asked my captain of detectives if he had body bags because if we get 140mph winds in mobile home parks, we are going to have fatalities.""
Matthew, the first major hurricane threatening a direct hit on the US in more than 10 years, was initially ranked as a Category 4 storm system.
It has since been downgraded, but wind gusts of up to 120mph, storm surges and torrential downpours are still set to strike the country.
More than three million people have been evacuated from Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina as the hurricane barrels in.
The terrifying storm system is currently around 10 miles off the east coast of Florida, but moving north west at speeds of 14mph.
It has already claimed the lives of 339, mainly in the Caribbean nation of Haiti.
""We are just bracing and the winds are picking up,"" Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry told CNN early today.
He added: ""A great number of our residents have taken heed to our warnings and we are certainly concerned about those that have not.""
More than 140,000 Florida households were left without power due to the severe weather, according to Governor Scott.
In West Palm Beach, street lights and houses went dark and Interstate 95 was empty as the storm rolled through the community of 100,000 people.
Matthew carried extremely dangerous winds of 130mph as it pounded the northwestern part of the Bahamas en route to Florida's Atlantic coast earlier, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
Few storms with winds as powerful as Matthew's have struck Florida, and the NHC warned of 'potentially disastrous impacts'.
The U.S. National Weather Service said the storm could be the most powerful to strike northeast Florida in 118 years.
Hurricane conditions were expected in parts of Florida today and a dangerous storm surge was expected to reach up to 11 feet along the Florida coast, Ed Rappaport, deputy director of the Miami-based NHC, said on CNN.
""What we know is that most of the lives lost in hurricanes is due to storm surge,"" he said.
Some 339 people were killed in Haiti, local officials said, and thousands were displaced after the storm flattened homes, uprooted trees and inundated neighborhoods earlier in the week.
Four people were killed in the Dominican Republic, which neighbors Haiti.
Damage and potential casualties in the Bahamas were still unclear as the storm passed near the capital, Nassau, yesterday and then out over the western end of Grand Bahama Island.
It was too soon to predict where Matthew might do the most damage in the US.
However, the NHC's hurricane warning extended up the Atlantic coast from southern Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina.
More than 12 million people in the United States were under hurricane watches and warnings, according to the Weather Channel.
The last major hurricane, classified as a storm bearing sustained winds of more than 110 mph, to make landfall on U.S. shores was Hurricane Wilma in 2005.
Roads in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina were jammed, and gas stations and food stores ran out of supplies as the storm approached early yesterday.
Scott warned there could be 'catastrophic' damage if Matthew slammed directly into the state and urged some 1.5 million people there to evacuate.
The Governor activated several thousand National Guard troops to help deal with the storm, while Florida, Georgia and South Carolina opened shelters for evacuees.
As of yesterday morning, more than 3,000 people were being housed in 60 shelters in Florida, Scott said.
Those three states as well as North Carolina declared states of emergency, empowering their governors to mobilize the National Guard.
President Barack Obama called the governors of the four states on Thursday to discuss preparations for the storm.
He declared a state of emergency in Florida and South Carolina, a move that authorized federal agencies to coordinate disaster relief efforts.
Late Thursday, Obama declared an emergency in Georgia and ordered federal aid to the state.
""Hurricane Matthew is as serious as it gets. Listen to local officials, prepare, take care of each other,"" Obama warned people in the path of the storm in a posting on Twitter.

""The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. The director himself has said he doesn't know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not. I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,"" she told reporters.
In a letter to members of Congress, FBI director James Comey revealed new messages have been found that are ""pertinent to the investigation"".
In July, FBI officials had recommended that no charges should be brought over the controversy which centres around Ms Clinton's use of a private email server to exchange messages with staff and other officials.
Her use of a private email server led many to think she was hiding secret information and putting the nation’s security at risk however she did not face a trial over the allegations.
Officials say the emails were discovered after the FBI seized devices belonging to Clinton campaign aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner.
He is being investigated after allegedly sending inappropriate messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.
The White House has said it first learned of the decision to re-open the probe in the media – but that President Obama's view of Ms Clinton has not changed as a candidate.
Her campaign chief John Podesta said the announcement's timing was “extraordinary” less than two weeks before the election.
He continued: “FBI Director Comey should immediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee.
""Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is ‘reopening’ an investigation but Comey’s words do not match that characterization.
""Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.”
Her rival Donald Trump was quick to react to the announcement saying the decision not to lay charges over the emails was a ""grave miscarriage of justice"" and added: ""Perhaps justice will finally be done.""
He said: ""Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.
""I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.
""This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody’s hope that it is about to be corrected.”
Addressing cheering crowds at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, he then joked about whether he should continue his speech at all.
He said: ""With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech?""
During the speech he also said the email controversy was ""bigger than Watergate"" – the 1970s political scandal over a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters that led to the resignation of then-president Richard Nixon.
In his letter to Congress, Mr Comey wrote: ""In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server.
""Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.
""In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.
""I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.""
But the new revelations have sparked anger among some members of the Democratic Party who claim Mr Comey has not given enough specifics despite making such a significant announcement just 10 days before Americans head to the polls.
Ms Clinton has repeatedly clashed with Donald Trump over the issue, with the Democratic candidate admitting during the first presidential debate that she had made a mistake by using the system during her time as US secretary of state.
She landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a campaign stop just minutes after the FBI announcement but has so far not made any comment.
Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said the letter raises ""serious questions"" and called for Ms Clinton to be removed from the presidential race.
He added: ""The FBI's decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's secret email server just eleven days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be.
""This stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law.
""What's indisputable is that Hillary Clinton jeopardized classified information on thousands of occasions in her reckless attempt to hide pay-to-play corruption at her State Department.
""This alone should be disqualifying for anyone seeking the presidency, a job that is supposed to begin each morning with a top secret intelligence briefing.""

Daredevil Tim Gallagher can be seen calmly maneuvering into the eye of the
The nerve-wracking footage shows the plane shuddering as it's thrown around while battling through the violent turbulence off Miami.
There's little visibility through the windscreen as the thick clouds and rain lash the aircraft.
Moments later the winds lessen as the plane passes through the other side of the storm, which has already devastated Haiti, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas.
Hurricane Matthew is still on course to hit around 26 million people as it passes through Florida and the east coast of the United States today.
Captain Gallagher and his team are part of self-styled 'hurricane hunters' for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and deliberately fly into terrifying storms.
They posted on their Facebook page ahead of their flights on #NOAA49 (GIV) and #NOAA43 (WP-3D Orion) to say they were preparing to take off at 2am into Hurricane Matthew.
Shortly before 7am BST they posted another update with the incredible video.
It said: ""The crew just returned from a very turbulent flight into the powerful Hurricane Matthew on WP-3D Orion NOAA43.

Incredible radar footage earlier emerged showing flight NOAA43 as it fearless headed into the eye of the hurricane off Miami.
Other aircrafts were forced to remain grounded today as other pilots chose to steer clear of the storm.
Two million Americans were told to leave Florida last night after being told Matthew ""is going to kill people”.
As 150mph winds headed for Miami, the storm was upgraded from Category Three to the second-highest Category Four – an official forecast of “catastrophic damage”.
It has since been downgraded back to Category Three as winds dropped to 120mph.
Matthew has already swept across the Caribbean leaving at least 136 dead in Haiti.

0000852,Do Republicans Believe Their Own Lies?,"In early 2010, Republican Scott Brown unexpectedly won a special election for a Senate seat in Massachusetts. Even though this put passage of Obamacare in mortal danger, President Obama urged Congress not to move ahead until Brown had been seated. They didn’t. Now, Democrats are urging Republicans to play equally fair and not move ahead with their tax bill until Doug Jones is seated following his win in the Alabama special election.
A White House official told CNN on Wednesday that the Brown example is different because Democrats passed health care in 2010 using a process that allowed them to do so with only a 50-vote majority — at the time, they had more than 50 Democrats — rendering Brown’s vote less critical.
The truth is just the opposite. The Senate passed Obamacare under regular order, which meant Democrats needed 60 votes to overcome Republican filibusters. With the election of Brown, their majority was reduced to 59 votes, which means that Brown’s election was more critical than Jones’s.
But here’s the question: was this just a garden variety lie, or does the anonymous official really believe what he said? The reason I ask is that Republicans have been telling the story of Democrats “jamming” Obamacare down their throats using tricky parliamentary procedures for so long that, as near as I can tell, most of them believe it these days. Even though it was only seven years ago, this story has been repeated so often they’ve literally forgotten that it’s not true. But it’s not. After Obamacare was passed normally by both House and Senate, it was only a small “sidecar” that was added under reconciliation procedures that required 50 votes. But the sidecar was optional. Even without it, the vast bulk of Obamacare had already passed.
So: was the White House flack lying, or is he just another Republican who’s come to sincerely believe his own lies? Hard to say. So here’s another question: Why would CNN pass this quote along without explaining that it’s wrong? That’s also hard to say.",unknown,True

Negative numbers are liberal, so Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley give an idea of the current far-left pole of the Democratic Party, while Mike Lee and James Risch are at the far-right pole of the Republican Party. Doug Jones will clearly be the most culturally liberal senator from Alabama since the New Deal, and depending on how he compares to Hugo Black, the most economically liberal too.

An audio clip from 2005 in which Trump bragged about sexual assault has thrown his candidacy and his party into turmoil, further undermining a campaign that was already losing.
As Rachel noted on the show, however, more tapes may yet surface. Indeed, with four weeks remaining before Election Day, and rumors swirling, it wouldn’t surprise anyone if additional recordings created new embarrassments for the controversial Republican presidential candidate.
But don’t worry, Republicans, Trump has a plan. In fact, as Yahoo News
NBC News posted the video of these remarks online
This is not a smart strategy.
First, Trump obviously believes there are additional recordings of him “saying inappropriate things,” as he put it, which will only encourage researchers to keep digging, knowing there’s more newsworthy content out there.
Second, the Republican nominee apparently assumes those in the media doing research on Trump’s record are partisans, motivated solely by Clinton’s electoral interests, which he believes makes his threat potent. That’s absurd. Plenty of journalists are investigating Trump’s record because he’s a candidate for the nation’s highest office, not because they want Clinton to win. Threatening them by saying more tapes will mean more anti-Clinton attacks will have no effect.
And finally, whether Trump realizes this or not, he’s already fired the big gun. Over the weekend, Trump ignored his party’s advice, turned back the clock 20 years, and decided assorted Bill Clinton accusers of varying degrees of credibility are now a central part of his campaign message.
And it landed with a thud. As was the case in the 1990s, the attacks impressed no one except rabid far-right activists who were already going to support Trump anyway.
In effect, his threat last night amounted to, “Stop making me look bad or I’ll repeat an ineffective attack!”",unknown,True
0000859,Why Trump's latest Benghazi theory matters more than most,"Donald Trump has said so many strange things about the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, it may be tempting to look past his latest tirade, assuming it’s more of the same. But when it comes to the Republican candidate’s rhetoric last night, don’t be too quick to dismiss it out of hand.
Trump addressed a crowd in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where he talked about Benghazi while holding a piece of paper in his hand. According to the GOP nominee, he was holding the printout of an email Sidney Blumenthal sent John Podesta – two prominent Hillary Clinton allies – in which, Trump said, Blumenthal “admitted they could have done something about Benghazi.”
As the crowd chanted, “Lock her up!” Trump dropped the printout and said, “This just came out a little while ago.”
So, what was Trump referring to? This gets a little complicated, but stick with me.
Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald wrote
Yesterday, a Russian-controlled news agency screwed up the details, and
Those need not be rhetorical questions.
Remember, as far as Trump is concerned, “This just came out a little while ago.” But as it turns out, “this” refers to a bogus article from the Russian government’s news website, which published a mistaken report just hours ahead of Trump’s rally, where he read the nonsense directly from a piece of paper.
I certainly don’t expect Trump or his campaign to acknowledge the fact that he was lying to his supporters in Pennsylvania last night, but it’d be interesting to learn more about how this came about. How did the mistake go from Russia’s government in the morning, literally into Trump’s hands in the evening?

Protesters also held signs in solidarity with indigenous communities who have been protesting the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The ongoing demonstrations seems now even more urgent as Trump’s “100 day plan” includes lifting the “restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal,” and lifting “Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward.”

0000864,What Is Paul Ryan Thinking?,"The House speaker could have left Trump alone rather than stab him in the back.
Having suffered the political equivalent of a blown tire while driving along an icy mountain road on Friday night, GOP nominee Donald J. Trump stabilized a seemingly fatal situation by Sunday evening. Through his commanding, issue-driven performance against Hillary Clinton in the second presidential debate, Trump steered his vehicle into a turnout. He replaced the flat with a new steel-belted radial and readied himself to return to the challenging road ahead.
But on Monday morning, House speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) raced in, slashed Trump’s tire anew, and nudged him toward the closest cliff.
Ryan could have left things alone, with Trump’s Access Hollywood tape receding in the rear-view mirror. Instead, Ryan donned his peacock feathers for an especially flamboyant display of moral preening.
Ryan erased the gap that Trump had placed between his candidacy and this controversy. Rather than let it be, Ryan dragged this whole episode back into the middle of the road.
During a conference call with GOP House members on Monday, Ryan reportedly announced that he neither would defend Trump nor campaign with him between now and Election Day. Naturally, pro-Clinton journalists (forgive the redundancy) fanned this hot coal into a forest fire.
Ryan could maintain his perch atop the moral high ground and do so quietly. He simply could go about his business and avoid Trump’s events. He could respond to journalists’ questions about the GOP nominee with bromides such as “I wish Donald Trump well and look forward to winning a larger House Republican majority on the night he wins the White House.”
This would have maintained peace on the right.
Instead, the day after Trump’s solid debate effort became the new narrative, Ryan needlessly fathered the unprecedented phenomenon of a Republican standard-bearer and a Republican speaker in open warfare with each other — just four weeks before a general election.
More than merely foolish politics, this episode exposes the reputedly level-headed Ryan as truly, deeply morally warped.
Everyone agrees that Trump’s comments about women (including references to female genitalia) were disappointing and inappropriate. Trump apologized for them twice before the latest debate and did so again at Sunday’s face-off against Clinton.
“This was locker-room talk,” Trump
(Remember: Trump’s words from 2005 are at issue here, not his actions. Conversely, Bill Clinton’s actual behavior somehow is no big deal. Journalists, feminists, and Democrats seem utterly uninterested in his sexual shenanigans with Monica Lewinsky, his widely acknowledged sexual harassment of Paula Jones, his alleged sexual assault of Kathleen Willey, and even a very credible accusation of rape by Juanita Broaddrick.)
But these multiple apologies were not good enough for Ryan. Apparently, Trump’s words are beyond forgiveness. So, Ryan snipped Trump’s brake lines, folded his arms, and is watching Trump’s sedan roll toward a precipice.
Ryan should ask himself these questions, as should those who applaud his behavior this week:
‐Is Trump’s “locker-room talk” so objectionable that Ryan would stand by and let Hillary Clinton win the White House?
If so, then in exchange for having a president who does not use “the P word” (as far as we know), America would be at the mercy of a more liberal, pro-choice Supreme Court. Concurrently, a Hillary-led federal government would work tirelessly to provide tax dollars for thousands — perhaps hundreds of thousands — of abortions.
To hell with Trump’s plans to turn the Hyde Amendment into an actual federal statute.
Hillary wants to kill the Hyde Amendment. But at least she will avoid the P word.
Ryan should ask himself: Which is worse, the sound of Trump on an 11-year-old tape or the silent screams of murdered unborn children whose numbers surely will climb under the militantly pro-abortion Hillary Clinton?
‐ As the price for having a president who does not use the P word, Ryan seems willing to let a President Hillary Clinton keep America’s taxes high, complex, unreformed, and anti-competitive. The corporate tax rate would stay at 35 percent, as taxes overall climbed by $1.55 trillion.
That would stick it to Trump, what with his P word, his 15 percent corporate tax rate, and his $4.4 trillion tax cut.
‐ As payment for having a president who avoids the P word, Ryan would hang back and let the prime mover of the disastrous Iran nuclear deal protect it as president and continue Obama’s policy of appeasing and, even worse, subsidizing Tehran’s radical-Islamic terror state with air-freight deliveries of cash and gold totaling between $1.7 billion and $
Who needs Trump, his P word, and a tough stance on Iran — including scrapping or at least overhauling the Iran nuclear deal and its $150 billion in unfrozen assets?
More federally subsidized abortions, more high taxes, and more goodies for the ayatollahs.
#related#These awful things, and many more, would be the venomous spawn of a Hillary Clinton administration.
Conversely, a President Trump likely would sign most legislation that a Republican Congress put on his desk. What an opportunity!
Who, precisely, does Ryan think would sign any remotely pro-market reform that a GOP Congress sent to a President Hillary Clinton?

0000867,"Just the Facts, Ma’am","Hillary Clinton’s cascading e-mail troubles are dragging her down ─ while issues are lifting Donald Trump up.
We knew there could be a big October surprise before this bizarre and unpopular election finally came to an end. But who knew it would come from e-mails found on a device used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner that was confiscated by the FBI after he allegedly sexted an underage woman — an act that cost him his job, his income, and his marriage?
As I pondered this on Friday afternoon, I had a faint recollection of Winston Churchill describing a tough loss in an MP election. Hat tip to Susan Varga, who located this Churchill gem: “In a twinkling of an eye, I found myself without an office, without a seat, without a party, and without an appendix.” Churchill had his appendix taken out during that election, which took place in 1922.
So let’s see here. Anthony Weiner lost his office and his seat. And while I don’t know about his appendix, he did lose his marriage for referring to matters below the waist.
And Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s aide and Weiner’s soon to be ex-wife, may well lose her seat and her office, although I couldn’t find any information about her appendix, despite a long Google search.
On the other hand, the FBI’s bombshell that it is reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server may well cause the Democratic presidential candidate to lose her office, her seat, and her party. As to the condition of her appendix, we’ll just have to guess, since no one knows the state of her deteriorating health.
And then we have FBI director James Comey, who may well be on his way to losing his office, his seat, and his reputation. (I have no information on the status of his appendix.)
And how bizarrely ironic is it that Comey — who lost considerable credibility a couple of months ago for building an iron-clad case against Hillary and then letting her off the hook — is now reopening her case based not on Russian espionage or Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, but on Anthony Weiner’s electronic sex life?
This will not bring honor and glory to J. Edgar Hoover’s venerable crime-fighting organization. Comey’s announcement, by the way, follows hot on the heels of the revelation that Clinton pal and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe channeled near $500,000 into the failed state senate campaign of Jill McCabe, who is the wife of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who helped oversee the agency’s investigation into Clinton’s private e-mail server. And let it be known that Hillary helped raise $1 million for McAuliffe’s PAC.
Did any of these connections have anything to do with Hillary’s getting off scot free from a criminal indictment? Nah.
But wait, could it be that Donald Trump’s accusation that the system is rigged is correct after all?
Now, from Churchill to Jack Webb. Remember him? He played LAPD Detective Sergeant Joe Friday on the great Dragnet series. He opened the show with, “This is the city: Los Angeles, California. I work here. I’m a cop.”
But the straight-shooting Detective Friday may be better known for this deadpan phrase: “Just the facts, ma’am.” Those are words that may go to the very heart of this presidential election.
No matter what James Comey unveils in the days ahead, if anything, virtually no one in this country believes Hillary Clinton will ever divulge “just the facts.”
#related#That’s what the polls say, and for her they’re getting worse. And that’s exactly what the FBI bombshell has reminded the voting public. Clinton, Inc., is dishonest, above the law, on the take.
New WikiLeaks-provided e-mails from Clinton aide Doug Band reveal the true nature of the Clinton cash operation: No matter what the stated humanitarian goals of the Clinton Foundation, every fiber and sinew of the organization is wrapped in self-dealing, self-enrichment, fraud, and corruption.
This is how the Clinton’s got rich. They traded cash for State Department visits and cash for government favors (like signing away 20 percent of American uranium reserves to oligarchic pals of Vladimir Putin). And let’s not forget those $450,000 speeches by Bill Clinton and those $250,000 speeches by Hillary herself.
And she can’t even tell the truth about that, as leaked e-mails show that she said one thing to Wall Street and quite another to the public.
The election is a week and a half away, and the atmosphere has changed significantly. In the last several days, at long last, Donald Trump has been talking issues on the campaign trail. Issues like the economy, tax cuts, the need to repeal and rewrite Obamacare, and even African American inner-city problems.

0000869,The Trials of Saint Hillary,"Hillary Clinton’s e-mail scandal is about her corruption, not the FBI director’s anti-woman bias.
Hillary Clinton is perfect.
That, apparently, is the Left’s new line on their nominee. It was one thing to label her a corrupt old crone when she was running against newfangled 1930s near-octogenarian Bernie Sanders. It was another thing to sigh over her foibles when she led Donald Trump by double digits.
But in a close election, Democrats have decided to don the blinders: Hillary is a saint. And all who oppose her are angels of darkness.
When Hillary’s e-mail scandal first cropped up, the Left acknowledged Hillary’s dicey relationship with the truth, but praised rival Bernie Sanders for his gentlemanly unwillingness to exploit Hillary’s corruption for political gain. Then, when Sanders finally shuffled off into the political sunset, they shifted their narrative: Now, Hillary was being targeted over speculation and innuendo — but she had some of that coming, given her decision to set up a private e-mail server. When the FBI effectively closed its original investigation, they could point to FBI director James Comey’s supposed rectitude as evidence for their theory that Hillary had made a mistake, but she hadn’t done anything criminal.
Then, like a zombie rising from the dead, E-mailgate returned: twice as brutal, twice as ugly, and twice as unkillable.
It’s too late in the election cycle to ward off E-mailgate with some tut-tutting or a wave of the hand. This election is too close for Democrats to simply acknowledge Hillary’s corruption, then vote for her in order to stop Trump.
No, they must blind themselves to Hillary’s corruption utterly, and blind others to it as well. They must spray lye in the eyes of the public to protect Hillary’s lies. And so the Left have declared their new enemies: James Comey, and supposed sexism.
Parodic New York Times columnist Charles Blow led the way with a column titled “
Senator Harry Reid (D., Nev.), a petrifying political cow dropping, has accused Comey, in full Joe McCarthy fashion, of the same malfeasance. “I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that [your] actions may violate the Hatch Act,” Reid wrote to Comey. “In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government#…#[but] you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.” Reid is now approximately five minutes from brandishing a list of Communists before the cameras, calling for Comey’s resignation.
And Harry Reid isn’t the only one. Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake — a woman who once declared that she would let rioters destroy her city because it was imperative to give them “room” to express themselves — called Comey “reckless” and suggested that “he’s under pressure and he got shook.” Former attorney general Eric Holder, who is still under contempt of Congress, declared Comey’s actions absolutely deplorable.
Most hilarious, Professor Robin Lakoff of the University of California, Berkeley, labeled the entire enterprise sexist. “
Too many Republicans look at how Democrats rally around awful people ranging from Bill Clinton to Teddy Kennedy, and think, ‘How can we do that?’
Lakoff apparently forgot that this re-investigation exists only began because a man, Anthony Weiner, is under FBI investigation; she apparently forgot that General David Petraeus was punished for similar crimes; she apparently neglects that 91 percent of all prison inmates are men, and that virtually every political scandal in history has targeted a man. But never mind that: Hillary must be shielded, and if her genitalia will serve the cause, so be it!
One of the most disappointing aspects of this election cycle has been the realization by some conservatives that many of our fellow conservatives want to be Democrats. They want to be Democrats not in terms of policy, although some Trump fans are indistinguishable from blue dog Democrats. They want to be Democrats in terms of politician-worship. Too many Republicans look at how Democrats rally around awful people ranging from Bill Clinton to Teddy Kennedy, and think, “How can we do that? If we just did that, we’d be able to elect more Republicans!”
There’s truth to that. Obviously, Democrats are willing to stand with their candidates, even after those candidates use their interns as humidors or their female friends as car anchors. But that’s what distinguishes Republicans from Democrats historically. And even when Republicans begin to act like Democrats — when we begin to excuse the worst excesses of our candidates in the name of victory — it doesn’t work all that well. Many Republicans still agonize over the foibles and evils of Trump. Many Republicans won’t vote for him. The same doesn’t hold true for Democrats, who may pretend at skepticism but fall into pure godworship the moment the chips are down.
Hillary Clinton isn’t a victim. She created a private server for her own benefit, and she’s been ensnared in her own paranoia and ambition. The fact that Democrats will cling to her sainthood despite that obvious truth demonstrates that Democrats cannot be trusted with power. To the extent that Republicans imitate Democrats, they can’t be trusted with power either.
Yes, at long last, the Left has pulled its anti-Trump card: Hillary has a vagina, and is being targeted for that supposedly debilitating condition.
The attempts to paint E-mailgate as sexism demonstrate the Left’s blindness to Hillary’s flaws. At least we acknowledge Trump’s faults in the GOP — or at least a major segment of us do. The Left’s attempts to pawn off all anti-Hillary scandals as effects of sexism (and Obama’s as effects of racism) are a basic avoidance maneuver.",unknown,True
0000870,A Fitting Final Chapter to the Sleaze Sweepstakes,"As the presidential campaigns sink to the challenge of demonstrating that there is no such thing as rock bottom, remember this: When the Clintons decamped from Washington in January 2001, they took some White House furnishings that were public property. They also finished accepting more than $190,000 in gifts, including two coffee tables and two chairs, a $7,375 gratuity from Denise Rich, whose fugitive former husband had been pardoned in President Clinton’s final hours. A Washington Post editorial (“Count the Spoons”) identified “the Clintons’ defining characteristic: They have no capacity for embarrassment. Words like shabby and tawdry come to mind. They don’t begin to do it justice.”
Today, Hillary Clinton strives to live again among some White House furnishings that she and her helpmeet were compelled to disgorge. Her campaign flounders because as secretary of state some of the nation’s business might have been melded with the contents of a computer that is pertinent to an FBI investigation of a former Democratic congressman’s alleged sexual texting with a female minor. Ransack the English language for words to do this justice.
During the recent welter of reports about the Clintons’ self-dealing through their charity that has been very charitable to them, The New Yorker, reporting her plans to uplift the downtrodden, quoted her aspiration: “I want to really marry the public and the private sector.” This would solve the Clintons’ problem of discerning the line between public business and private aggrandizement: Erase the line.
So, herewith America’s choice. Restore the House of Clinton. Or confer executive powers — powers that President Obama by his audacity, and Congress by its lethargy, have proven to be essentially unlimited — on another competitor in the sleaze sweepstakes, Donald Trump, who shares his opponent’s disinclination to disentangle the personal and the political.

Into this political maelstrom, FBI director James Comey injected an announcement that intensified the chaos without providing a scintilla of news that voters can use: An unknown number of e-mails of unknown provenance and unknown content might be “pertinent” to an investigation that already has established, beyond peradventure, that Secretary Clinton was “extremely careless” with sensitive material.
Add the FBI, and the Justice Department to which it belongs, to the carnage of institutions that is a byproduct of bad judgments by the political class that have voters asking Casey Stengel’s question. In 1962, Stengel, manager of the New York Mets, an expansion team en route to a record of 120 losses, looked down his dugout at his woebegone players and wondered aloud, “Can’t anybody here play this game?”
It is grimly hilarious to hear it said that the Justice Department, by not holding Comey to established protocols concerning discussions of ongoing investigations, and concerning pronouncements close to elections, has tainted itself. Obamacare would not have passed if Justice Department lawyers had not conducted what a federal judge declared a corrupt prosecution of Alaska’s Republican senator Ted Stevens, costing him reelection. The department has enabled, by not seriously investigating, the IRS’s suppression of political advocacy by conservative groups. Or of the IRS’s subsequent destruction of subpoenaed e-mails pertinent to this. So, unsurprisingly, the most intrusive and potentially punitive federal agency continues to punish conservative groups for being conservative, according to Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer for political groups who confirms there are indeed conservative organizations who were targeted by the IRS and have still not received their tax-exempt status.
In 2013, Barack Obama professed himself “angry” about “inexcusable” IRS behavior, before he decided there was not a “smidgen” of IRS corruption. He claimed to have learned about the IRS behavior from the media. Now he claims that he learned from the media about Clinton’s e-mail abuses, although they had exchanged e-mails using her private server. Perhaps.
The defining scandal of the Obama era has been the media’s lackadaisical consensus that Obama’s administration has had no serious scandal. This, although with the Justice Department protecting the IRS, the administration has (in the words of Richard Nixon’s White House counsel John Dean) used “the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.”
#related#Clinton, the ultimate author of her current agony, resembles no one so much as Nixon in her paranoia and joyless pursuit of joy. Her government career began with the House committee preparing Nixon’s impeachment. Twenty-two years earlier, he had saved his career by addressing a supposed scandal with his nationally broadcast “Checkers speech,” which was mawkish, abasing, and effective. How fitting it would be for a Clinton “Checkers speech” to end our long national nightmare that this campaign has been.",unknown,True
0000871,Who Deserves Credit for the Trump Administration’s Accomplishments?,"Contrary to what many predicted, President Trump’s end-of-year accomplishment list isn’t that skimpy.
That’s an analytical observation. For many, particularly liberals and Democrats, Trump’s first year hasn’t been merely bad. It’s a great evil, a grievous wound to the American body politic.
But even that is a kind of partisan tribute to what’s been accomplished on his watch: a record number of judicial appointments, including a Supreme Court justice; the defeat of Islamic State; repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate; tax reform; and major rollbacks of various regulations, from arctic drilling to net neutrality.
It hasn’t exactly been smooth sailing. Trump is the most unpopular first-year president in American history, for reasons far beyond mere bad press.
Still, among conservatives, the tally of “wins” has sparked some intramural debates. The most prominent one is how Trump skeptics and avowed Never Trumpers should respond to those wins. For writers such as the Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin and The Atlantic’s David Frum, the only legitimate response is either to ignore these successes or denigrate them, lest people lose sight of the threat Trump poses to the country. Others, including myself, argue instead that one needn’t deny the merits of a policy victory simply because the president might get credit for it.
This debate skips over the larger question of whether these victories happened because of Trump or despite him.
On one level, the president always gets the credit — or blame — for anything that happens on his watch. But Trump poses a challenge to such superficial scorekeeping. No president in American history has rejected Harry Truman’s “The buck stops here” motto as vehemently or consistently as this one. He never accepts responsibility for his own mistakes, never mind those of his administration or party. When American troops die, the commander in chief blames “the generals.” When legislation fails, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the “establishment” are at fault.
Trump boosters agree. Conservative writer Roger Simon argues that all “remaining Never Trumpers” must apologize for being wrong about the president. He chalks up Trump’s “astoundingly successful” first year to the fact the president is a “quick study.”
But what evidence is there that Trump has actually learned the art of presidential management?
Aside from the mandatory flattery required of Republican elected officials, there’s remarkably little testimony that Trump has involved himself in the process of governing. Tax reform was carried across the finish line by the GOP congressional leadership. Net neutrality was repealed by independent Republicans at the Federal Communications Commission.
Foreign policy is a more mixed bag. If the president deserves credit for the defeat of Islamic State, it’s because he let “the generals” do their thing. On the other hand, credit (or blame) for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris accord on climate change certainly goes to him.
In general, it seems to me that Trump’s success (such as it is) is less attributable to sudden mastery of the issues than to staying out of the way of rank-and-file Republican policymakers, activists, and bureaucrats.
For instance, the task of selecting judicial appointees, starting with Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, has largely been outsourced to the Federalist Society. When the president revealed his new national-security strategy last week, his speech — the usual campaign blather — had only a passing resemblance to the underlying document. The tax bill is clearly more in line with House Speaker Paul Ryan’s ideology than candidate Trump’s supposed populism. As for a counter-example: When Trump was “hands-on” with Obamacare repeal, he often revealed he didn’t even know what was in the legislation.
In 2016, some conservatives argued that Republicans should vote as if we live in a parliamentary democracy, electing a party, not a person. Trump’s 3,000 political appointees would be better than Hillary Clinton’s. That argument had its flaws, not least that voters tend not to compartmentalize that way — which is why the GOP faces a potential bloodbath in the 2018 midterms.
But there’s merit to it as well. To listen to Trump’s cheerleaders, the biggest obstacle to conservative victories is the party establishment, when in reality it looks more like it’s running the show.

Cruz has been in the news since she publicly slammed Donald Trump for the federal government's lack of adequate response to the disaster in Puerto Rico.

Her latest tweet following the reports of Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault is one of those things.
Luckily, practically the entire Internet piled on, including lauded actor and wordsmith, Don Cheadle.
His epic clap back is loaded with juicy words, and the best part is, they're all used to insult Kellyanne Conway.
Kellyanne Conway used the allegations against Harvey Weinstein of years of sexual harassment and abuse to attack Hillary Clinton (not the president). We would expect nothing more from the woman who's still defending Donald Trump's every move.
It took Hillary abt 5 minutes to blame NRA for madman's rampage, but 5 days to sorta-kinda blame Harvey Weinstein 4 his sexually assaults.
The terrifying subtext of this tweet, of course, is that Republicans are secretly ecstatic that Weinstein is a member of the “liberal elite” and they can use these horrific allegations not to bring to light the systemic problem of sexual assault but to blast Hillary Clinton, even though, she is — say it with me — not the president and not even an active politician.

If this “hidden” most powerful primal muscle is healthy, we are healthy.
Is it…
Take the quiz above and see if you got the correct answer!
P.S. Make sure you check out the next page to get to know the
However I promise what you'll discover today will be completely worth it.
Imagine a rotting corpse draped over your body from head to toe...
...suffocating tissue, restricting blood flow, damaging joints and infecting your healthy cells.
Shockingly, that nightmare is a reality for most:
64% of women and 74% of men carry too much body fat according to the National Institutes of Health.
It's choking their organs, assaulting their metabolism and sucking their energy dry.
But here's the worst part:
For most, this bodyfat has become ""calorie-resistant"":
It's completely unaffected by even the strictest diets... and most intense exercises.
This zombie fat is essentially... ""dead tissue"".
That's important for those who have 10, 25 or 50 or more pounds to lose...
AND for those who aren't technically overweight, but have what's called ""pocket obesity""...
...unsightly patches of fat that cling to specific places, like:
just above your hips, lower belly, where your butt and legs meet... and even arms, neck and face.
However, there's good news:
Obesity researchers have now discovered a ""metabolic jumper cable"":
It jolts dead bodyfat back to life.
This allows your metabolism to burn it as calories and re-energize your entire body.
First though, here's the #1 reason why bodyfat becomes calorie-resistant:
It lacks blood flow. This has 3 effects:
All this means one thing:
Your body can't transform into energy, the 135,000+ of calories the average person stores as fat!
You become a metabolic zombie: NO energy to think. NO energy to move. NO energy to motivate.
Update: calorie-resistant bodyfat can be now removed...
The discovery of this ""metabolic jumper cable"" can now reverse this process:
Not only do those layers of ""zombie fat"" start coming off, but your entire body just works better.
Plus, as your whole body burns more calories, those patches of pocket obesity whittle away.
This ""metabolic jumper cable"" isn't any exercise, machine or pill.
It's a little-known, calorie-burning hormone we all have... just waiting for the right spark to come alive.
It's not
And on
PS - Studies show that not only can healthy levels of this powerful calorie-burning hormone devour bodyfat and fortify soft muscle, but it can also reduce your risk of diabetes by 53.7%, a heart attack by 83.3% and stroke by 51.4%.
In April, 2009, researchers stunned the medical community when they reported chronic inflammation as the root cause of several major diseases.
See, every year 610,000 people in the U.S. die of heart disease.
Truth is, we now know... chronic inflammation is responsible for 7 out of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States! Hundreds of studies and scientific reviews prove it.
Fortunately, newer research shows you can prevent-even reverse-most major diseases by ""turning off"" inflammation. And in our new book, we show you how to do just that.
If you or a loved one is suffering from a debilitating condition-and you""re not sure what the culprit is-now's the time to find out...while you can still do something about it!

But there is a lot of confusion as to where bread fits into a healthy diet.

And for a poison, we sure eat lots of it…

The answers to these questions may surprise you!
Be sure to read #5 – the biggest surprise of all!
Recently, Doctor of Naturopathy, weight-loss expert and best-selling Amazon author Liz Swann Miller, creator of the Red Smoothie Detox Factor, revealed 2 of the secrets to easy, steady weight loss. Secrets the big food corporations do their best to hide from us.
Secret #1: Enjoy real food. Don’t fall for the lie that you have to deprive yourself to lose weight.
Secret #2: stop eating out. You will automatically eat less without even noticing.
Then start detoxing your body with tasty, nourishing smoothies that are just as easy on your wallet as they are easy to make.
Because a single day of enjoying Liz’ smoothies demonstrated the radical power of her superfood-packed red smoothies to make me feel incredibly good.
Now prepare yourself for one of the biggest weight loss secrets there is. A secret that, when you use it properly, can transform your body and your health.
You probably know most of us eat too much processed food. What you may not know is that it’s full of toxic chemicals and substandard, dirt-cheap ingredients designed to make you eat more…and force you to gain weight.
Here’s how it works.
“That stuff is just a lot of calories your body can’t use,” Liz told me, “Some are poison. And all these foods are stripped of the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that help your body detox. The result? Your body expends huge amounts of calories to eliminate some toxins—the rest, it stores in your fat to protect you. This is why most people are hungry all the time. They’re not getting energy they need.”
“So… what’s going on with me? Why am I losing weight but not going hungry?”
Liz paused, then dropped the bombshell.
Your body is designed to burn fat. You just have to let it.
“What? I thought we were designed to store fat?!?” We were Skyping and I was practically shouting. Then I heard Liz say…
What good is a fat reserve if you can’t burn it?
Mind blown.
Liz continued: “You’re drinking smoothies packed with phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that pull toxins out of you like a tractor beam. Allowing your body to burn those toxin-filled fat stores… and releasing tremendous amounts of stored energy.”
So that’s why I’m losing weight without going hungry.
Watch Liz’ free presentation. It’s packed with revolutionary weight loss information—information that works. Because it’s based on how nature.
Click the button only if you want to wear smaller clothes, breathe easier, move more freely and just plain feel better.

5) Turmeric is amazing. The problem is - It's hard to absorb!
6) Wonder why your stomach still sticks out even though you're hammering the core exercises every day? It's a common myth that bulging belly is due to weak abdominal muscles.

In fact, Hannity’s entire oeuvre for much of the Trump presidency has been built around a massive, all-encompassing conspiracy theory: That a
On one occasion, Hannity
Hannity’s conspiracy theory has several key benefits: It allows Hannity to delegitimize any possible sources of negative information about the Trump administration by tying them into the plot; it encourages his viewers to stick with the president because he is beset by such malicious foes; and, perhaps most importantly, it allows Hannity to shift attention from the possible malfeasance Mueller may discover in his investigation to the question of whether Mueller himself is a criminal running an illegitimate probe
The Times appears to have missed all this. Indeed, for someone claiming to be steeped in Hannity’s work, Shaer appears to have largely ignored Hannity’s discussion of the Russia investigation, perhaps the most important story of the year. The profile does not mention Mueller at all, and references Russia only a handful of times. A few of the dots are there -- the Times writer mentions, for instance, that Hannity’s Seth Rich theory was intended to undermine the case for Russia’s role in hacking the DNC to bolster Trump, and that Hannity views the Uranium One conspiracy as a way to “boomerang” the Russia investigation on Democrats -- he just doesn’t quite pull them together. And given how wild Hannity’s claims have become -- and the potential results they might have if his most powerful fan were to act on him -- that’s a big miss.
Take last night’s edition of Hannity. Monday morning, ABC News
But if you were one of the 3-million-plus viewers to turn in to Hannity’s show last night -- perhaps including the president -- you saw him assemble a case aimed at encouraging the audience to disbelieve anything Flynn might say following a plea deal, and instead direct their fire at Mueller’s team. Or, as Fox judicial analyst Gregg Jarrett, a Hannity
SEAN HANNITY: How could this happen in the United States of America, Gregg? This is not a banana republic here.
GREGG JARRETT: Because the Department of Justice, and particularly the FBI and Comey and Mueller at the FBI, have turned into this renegade rogue deep state that operates under their own rules.
HANNITY: Do they really -- they don't want Manafort. They don't want General Flynn. They want Trump.
JARRETT: Yes. And what I worry about are ruthless prosecutors who suborn perjury. What they do is they make promises and threats to defendants. You’re gonna spend 10 years behind bars unless you sign this statement and the witness says, “but that's a lie,” and the prosecutor doesn't seem to care.
HANNITY: Or I’m gonna go after your son.
JARRETT: It's extortion. It's bribery. When they do it it's legal. When you and I do it it's illegal. It's got to stop.
That’s the message going out to Hannity's millions of viewers, perhaps including the president: Trump is being persecuted by an illegal cartel that will do anything and lie to anyone to force the innocent Trump from office. The only plausible deniability Hannity has is that which people like Shaer are willing to grant to him.

0000881,Politics — not as dirty as you think,"The success of a marriage nearly always depends on the expectations of the parties going in. If you believe marriage is going to be a rose garden of happy trips to the beach interspersed with moonlight dinners and foot massages, you're more likely to end up cheating on your spouse when that doesn't materialize. If you believe marriage is a mechanism for changing your potential spouse, you likely are to end up estranged. If you believe marriage is about a lifelong union devoted to self-improvement and the creation and rearing of children, you likely are to make decisions that lead to that outcome.
Americans don't trust politicians. That's for good reason. Politicians fib to get elected; they pander to particular constituencies; they leave principle at the door in favor of convenience in order to maintain power and position. But they do not, at least not that often, murder people and collude with foreign governments.
But thanks to popular culture, that's exactly what many Americans think politicians do. If you watch ""House of Cards,"" you likely are to believe top-level politicians ""off"" each other on a regular basis — and you might be more willing to believe conspiracy theories about the murder of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. If you've seen ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" you're more likely to believe either former President Obama or President Trump is one.
President Trump, who was a layman until he became president, obviously believes a lot of the pop culture mythology surrounding politics. That's why he told Bill O'Reilly it's not that big of a deal Russian President Vladimir Putin kills his political opponents.
""You think our country's so innocent?"" he said in jaw-dropping fashion.
That's why Trump believes politics is such a ""dirty business"" — dirtier, even, than Manhattan real estate, where Trump worked with mafia figures. Politics, in Trump's mind, is the lowest of the low.
That means a more corrupt administration. If you believe, as Trump assuredly does, anyone would take a meeting with Russian government figures to dig up dirt on an opponent, then you'll do it, too. Why be martyred just because you were too holy to get down in the mud? If you think Hillary Clinton is the way politics is done — we shouldn't be outraged because she's just another politician — then why not play by the same rules?
Voters like to believe, as Trump does, politics is filthy because we refuse to acknowledge, in a representative republic, we're the ultimate sources of blame. We keep electing these moral idiots. We keep voting for them, demanding they give us things and suggesting they've ""sold out"" if they don't. We're the ones who decry crony capitalism while complaining the local factory will leave unless the government ""does something.""
Politicians like to believe, as Trump does, politics is sordid because that's a tailor-made excuse for participating in bad behavior. It's also an excuse for legislating morality, as Sen. John McCain tried to do with campaign finance reform — you can use the public distrust of politicians to restrict the political speech of citizens, all in the name of ""cleaning up the system.""
It always is easier to shift our vision of politics than to shift our vision of ourselves.
And so, we get the politics we deserve. Our belief politics is a squalid affair finds realization in our politicians, who reflect that view, and in ourselves as we vote for those politicians. And then, we're surprised when politics seems to grow more and more disreputable.

0000882,A canceled cruise to Cuba cost this couple hundreds of dollars,"A cruise to Cuba is a dream for many people, but there are specific rules that a company must follow and a special certification it needs to run a cruise. When Pamela Gillet booked her dream cruise to Cuba with Pearl Seas Cruises, she assumed the company had secured permission to run the trip it sold her.
We consistently advise our readers to do their research, but in this case Gillet needed to go beyond the terms and conditions for the cruise line. She needed to know whether the company had complied with U.S. law. The fact that she didn’t cost her $528. Can we help her get it back?
Three weeks prior to her scheduled embarkation date, Gillet had not received final documents, so she called Pearl Seas Cruises. She was told that one cruise had already been canceled, and a second one would also be canceled. The company admitted that it had not received the required certification to sail, but couldn’t tell Gillet for certain if her cruise would sail.
One week prior to the embarkation date, Gillet was finally given the bad news: The cruise had been canceled. The company refunded the full amount that Gillet paid for the cruise, but then she requested a refund on the amount she paid for a nonrefundable hotel stay one night before the cruise embarked and nonrefundable flights to Ft. Lauderdale.
Approximately 90 days after she requested a refund of these costs, Pearl Seas Cruises told her that her request was “still under consideration.” While we don’t specifically list contact information for Pearl Seas Cruises (our research team is on it, though), Gillet says she knew that Pearl Seas is owned by
What might have helped Gillet was researching the company with which she planned to travel, to determine if it had the authority to operate the trips. Travel to Cuba has been problematic for decades. It’s the only country to which U.S. citizens are banned from traveling — even travel to North Korea isn’t currently banned.
Travel to Cuba and the prohibition of financial and commercial transactions by U.S. citizens was enacted in 1963 under President Kennedy. The travel ban was lifted in 2009 when President Obama lifted restrictions for Cuban-Americans, allowing them to visit relatives and provide financial support to their families in Cuba. Americans of non-Cuban descent were still generally prohibited from traveling to the island neighbor.
In January 2011, what is now known as the “people-to-people” travel rules were enacted, expanding the categories of people who were allowed to travel to Cuba to include U.S. citizens pursuing “purposeful travel,” including academics, religious groups, students and charities. At this time, most travel to Cuba was through affinity organizations like alumni associations, as well as through churches or cultural groups.
After the “diplomatic thaw” near the end of 2014, travel rules became even more relaxed, allowing Americans to travel to Cuba. In March 2015, MasterCard became the first company to unblock credit card use in Cuba, and later that month the first direct U.S.-Cuba charter flight was operated by Sun Country Airlines. Airbnb began listing rentals around Cuba the following month.
Although travel restrictions have clearly relaxed, operating tours to Cuba still requires a People-to-People license. Unlike the other 11 categories of authorized travel to Cuba, the People-to-People license allows any American to legally travel to Cuba, as long as they have a full schedule of activities that enhance contact with Cuban citizens and result in “meaningful interaction” between American and Cuban citizens.
The Pearl Seas Cruises website is clear that its voyages are subject to obtaining the required permissions on its
Operation of the planned voyages is subject to obtaining all necessary approvals, permits and licenses from the governments of the U.S. and Cuba. All passengers must comply with U.S. and Cuban laws and regulations related to travel to Cuba.
Cruise companies plan their cruise far in advance because travelers book their travel far in advance. It is common that not all licenses have been granted at the time a cruise is planned and sold, and that’s likely one of many reasons that cruise lines include this clause in their
PSC reserves the right to change, cancel or substitute any itinerary, vessel, port of call, schedule, tour, excursion or duration of voyage at any time and for any reason whatsoever without prior notice (including reducing or extending days of voyage or continuing or finishing a voyage via other means of transportation) and shall not be liable for any claim whatsoever by Passenger for such change, including, but not limited to, loss, compensation, or refund; except Passenger shall be entitled to (i) a pro rata refund, calculated on a per day basis, of fare actually paid less applicable fees and charges, if a Cruise is cancelled or terminates early, and (ii) a refund of deposit actually paid to PSC for a tour or excursion, if that tour or excursion is cancelled.
Gillet claims that the Pearl Seas Cruises representative recommended arriving one day before the cruise embarkation date, which is good advice — if your flight is delayed and you miss embarkation you may have to either spend more money to get yourself to the next port or cancel your cruise with no refund.
Pearl Seas Cruises offers to book hotel nights and air for their guests, and had Gillet booked her overnight and air through the cruise line, the company likely would have immediately refunded her in full — or at least offered a credit on a future cruise, when it finally received authorization to operate travel to Cuba. The other option would have been to book refundable air tickets, but most canceled air tickets retain their value for one year after the booking date.
Gillet contacted us in an effort to recover the $528 she lost on her nonrefundable hotel room and air tickets. We contacted Pearl Seas Cruises multiple times on her behalf, but it ignored us. It did eventually offer Gillet a $528 credit on another Cuba cruise in 2017, but it took so long for the company to make that offer that Gillet had already booked other travel plans and cannot do another trip this year, so she refused the offer.
It’s certainly understandable that travelers prefer to book pre-cruise travel on their own — often at a cheaper rate — but as long as cruise lines continue to get away with the “we can do whatever we want with our itinerary and we don’t owe you anything” clause, if you choose to cruise, it may be best to book your air and additional nights through the cruise line or buy travel insurance from another source (not the cruise line) that will cover itinerary changes, cancellations, and company defaults.
We’re sorry we couldn’t help Gillet, but we still hope Pearl Seas Cruises comes to its senses and refunds her money.",unknown,True
0000883,Is Avis’ 42 euro “referral” fee in Milan a scam?,"Italy’s infamous restricted traffic zones have struck again, this time snagging Douglas Schmucker, an unsuspecting Avis car rental customer.
Schmucker doesn’t have a problem with the law, or following the law. Instead, his dispute is with Avis, which he says failed to warn him that its car rental facility in Milan was located in a “restricted” parking zone.
And neglecting to disclose that little detail cost him money.
AirHelp is the world’s leading flight delays compensation company, helping passengers apply for compensation following a delayed or canceled flight or when boarding has been denied. It is AirHelp’s mission to fight for passenger rights by holding airlines accountable for flights disruptions that are out of passengers’ control. AirHelp has already helped 5 million people, taking the stress out of applying for compensation and making it as hassle-free as possible for travelers around the world.
“We recently received a letter from the legal office of Avis Italia informing us that we received a charge of 42 euros on a credit card to cover the cost of providing our rental information to the parking authority for driving in restricted Zone C in Milan,” he says. “We were entirely unaware that the Avis location was in a restricted driving zone and the Avis staff made no effort to inform us of that fact.”
Actually, Avis does inform customers of the Italian traffic laws, and
Are there any roads or zones where I need to pay a fee before I can enter?
Yes, certain areas, such as the centre of Milan-area C, have congestion charging zones meaning you need to pay a fee if you wish to drive in certain areas, on certain days and during certain times. In addition, there are toll roads and toll bridges which require you to pay a fee if you wish to use them. If you do not pay these charges before you enter such areas or use such roads or bridges, you will incur a fine.
We recommend you check the Internet to find out about any restricted areas before you travel. Websites such as
But who has the time to read all of the fine print? Besides, someone from Avis should have said something to Schmucker, right?
“Avis Milan must inform all clients who use the Piazza Diaz office of the need to obtain a permit for the restricted area for pick-up and drop-off of rental vehicle,” he says. “Avis also needs to revisit the 42-euro charge simply for providing clients’ contact info to the municipal authorities.”
That’s a point worth underscoring. The 42 euros isn’t the traffic fine — it’s a referral fee so that Italian authorities can send Schmucker a fine. That’s a hefty price to pay for simply giving authorities a name — something that is likely automated, anyway.
All of which leaves me wondering: Is this a scam?
Consider that Avis must know that the location is in a restricted parking zone. While it warns customers in the fine print of its website, it surely knows that most customers will not bother to read it. Let’s assume the actual cost of sending Italian authorities to the name and contact information of its drivers is 2 euros.
Isn’t that a little bit like raising the cost of your car rentals by 40 euros?
Then again, customers were warned. Avis is just following the law. And maybe, just maybe, it actually costs Avis 42 euros for a referral — in other words, maybe it isn’t making any money from the transaction.
I think you know which way I’m leaning on this one.
“The 42 euro surcharge and the eventual traffic violation costs should be either dismissed or covered by Avis,” says Schmucker.
I agree — that would be the ideal outcome.",unknown,True
0000884,DirecTV Has Americans Cheering After NFL National Anthem Protests,"The NFL sparked a massive controversy over the past few days after hundreds of professional football players refused to stand for the national anthem in protest. Although this protesting has been going on since last year, the number of participants drastically increased after President Donald Trump’s controversial remarks; Trump insinuated, a few days prior to Sunday’s games, that the NFL should fire those who take a knee during the anthem.
The protests, started by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in support of Black Lives Matter, were originally created to fight against police brutality and racial injustice. However, several teams, including the Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos, confirmed that they knelt directly in response to Trump’s comments.
Therefore, the protests were no longer about racial injustice, but became an anti-Trump movement. Many Americans were angered by the protesting of the football players and threatened to boycott the NFL altogether because they felt it was disrespecting our American flag and those who serve(d) our country.
These apparently were not empty threats. DirecTV announced that they are offering refunds to customers for purchases of the NFL Sunday Ticket if they desire to cancel in relation to the national anthem protesting. Hundreds of people have reportedly called the company in regards to cancellations.
This is a big deal since the original policy clearly states that refunds cannot be issued once football season has begun, according to
Americans are praising DirecTV for their bold move. Although the company has not directly said they are against the #TakeAKnee movement, customers appreciate the fact that they are giving their clientele this option.

0000885,Young Boy Undergoes Sex Change Three Times and Tragically Suffers,"As conservatives have dedicated a notable amount of time trying to stop efforts to let children suffering from gender confusion “change” their sex, the Left has responded with calls of “transphobia.” By listening to the Left, you’d think that conservatives were nothing short of inhumane and insensitive, opposing a measure that helps people be comfortable in their own bodies. That's at least the Left's narrative about this supposed struggle for ""equality"" and ""civil rights.""
But nothing can be further from the truth. In fact, the Left’s effort to let children suffering from gender confusion “change” their sex has created many victims, one of them being 23-year old Brad Cooper, who has “changed” his sex a reported three times.
“Doctors controversially backed her belief she was a girl in a boy’s body,” writes the Daily Wire. “She was given blockers to stop her going through puberty, followed by injections of female hormones to impede face and chest hair and triggered the formation of breasts.”
Despite being hailed a hero by the Jacobin Left, the confused young man then reversed his sex change process at the age of 18. And now, at the young age of 23, Cooper is “changing” his sex for a third time from a girl back to a boy.
Cooper’s gender confusion has impacted him in more ways than the pains of being under continual gender-changing efforts. After undergoing his first sex change effort at the age of 15, Cooper attempted to commit suicide twice. He also got hooked on drugs, and even resorted to prostitution while still a minor, in part to pay for his lavish new female wardrobe. After suffering tragically from his disordered sexuality and painful lifestyle, he decided to stop his hormone treatment and once-more “change” back to a male, his biological sex.
“I made so many mistakes,” remarked Cooper. “On the surface I was hard as nails, but underneath it hurt like hell. The puberty blockers and hormones made me moody and angry. I was all over the place. My mom supported me, but I moved out and went wild, drinking and taking drugs to cope with being different.”
Now Cooper wishes to once more “return” to be a “woman.” He claims that being a woman is his true identity, and that one day he wishes to get married and have children.
After embracing his biological sex, Cooper remarks that “it just felt wrong.” He continues, “I came to the realization pretty quickly I was doing it because I wanted all the problems associated with being transgender to go away. I was no longer able to hide who I really am. Not for family, or friends or potential boyfriends. I have to be true to myself.”
“It’s hard to see a bright future for this poor victim,” remarks the Daily Wire. “Transgendered people suffer from an astronomical attempted suicide rate of 40% (eight times the rate of non-trans folk) and are much more likely to experience homelessness.”
“Moreover, it’s clear that Cooper’s 15-year-old experience only compounded his problems,” continues the Daily Wire. “Upwards of 80% of children who suffer from gender dysphoria grow out of such confusion before adulthood; should cooper have been cared for as a 15-year-old in a manner that thoroughly addressed the condition psychologically, instead of opting for medical means to ‘change’ his biological sex, perhaps Cooper would have had a different future.”
Rather than criticizing Cooper, who is clearly suffering, perhaps the best thing we can do is pray for him – pray that he abandons his disordered sexual proclivities and finds peace. Cooper, too, is a creation of God and a human being with inherent dignity who deserves a good life.

Kilmeade then suggested that Kimmel speak directly with Cassidy and Graham. (Kimmel, of course, already spoke with Cassidy, who appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live
UPDATE: Kilmeade once again addressed Kimmel’s comments on his Fox News radio show, defending himself against — of all things — the idea that he ever wanted a career in Hollywood.
“For him to go out and attack me personally, and try to get into my personality, saying, ‘He wants to be a Hollywood celebrity’? I’ve never… Why would I ever leave the number one network in all of cable… to get out to Los Angeles and do entertainment? I mean, what… what point is that? ‘No one will hire him’? It’s not even based in fact.”
The rant, which lasted nearly seven minutes, also found Kilmeade taking umbrage with Kimmel suggesting that he was short. (Yes, really!)
“I guess you said, ‘this little man,’ or something like that. I’m 5’10, 174 pounds. Sorry that’s not good enough for you, but I just think if you look at the average chart of a male in America, I think I’m pretty much on target.” Kudos?
Adding fuel to the fire, Sen. Cassidy on Wednesday suggested to CNN’s Chris Cuomo that Kimmel simply “does not understand” the bill at all.
“Oh, I get it. I don’t understand because I’m a talk show host, right?” Kimmel asked, sarcastically. Then, after listing over a dozen major health care organizations that “vehemently oppose the bill,” the late-night host suggested that perhaps the problem is that “I do understand, and you got caught with your G-O-Penis out.
“I don’t want to turn this into a Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation, but when Senator Cassidy was on my show in May, he told me that he believed that every American family regardless of income should be able to get quality health care, and I believed he was sincere,” Kimmel continued. “Sadly, the bill he unveiled last week with Senator Lindsey Graham indicates that he was not sincere. It is, by many accounts, the worst health care bill yet.”

0000887,Trump Jr. calls charge of collusion 'ridiculous',"Trump Jr. allowed Tuesday night in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel that ""he has probably met with other people from Russia"" but insisted that he did not attempt to coordinate to impact the election or try to damage Hillary Clinton.
He repeatedly suggested that the charges of collusion were ""ridiculous"" and ""overplayed"" and insisted that his father knew nothing about the June 2016 meeting.
""It was such a nothing there was nothing to tell"" his father, said Trump Jr.
Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father's campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton, according to the emails.
The
President Donald Trump says his eldest son is ""a high-quality person,"" and he applauds ""his transparency.""
In a tweet Tuesday night, the president promoted his son's appearance on Fox News and called him a ""great person who loves our country.""
My son, Donald, will be interviewed by
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a brief statement from the president Tuesday in response to revelations that Trump Jr. agreed to hear damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's effort to help his father.
Trump Jr., who was deeply involved in his father's presidential campaign, released the emails along with a statement describing the disclosure as an effort ""to be totally transparent."" The emails with publicist Rob Goldstone show that Trump Jr. was told that the Russian government had information that could ""incriminate"" Clinton and her dealings with Russia.
Here's my statement and the full email chain
The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said sought to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. As congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, investigate, the emails will almost certainly be reviewed for any signs of potential campaign collusion with the Kremlin, which the White House has repeatedly denied.
Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the emails, citing the ongoing investigation.
Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints).
In the emails, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that the information ""would be very useful to your father."" Goldstone was working to connect Trump Jr. to Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who later met with Trump Jr. in New York at Trump Tower.
Veselnitskaya has denied that she ever worked for the Russian government and said on Tuesday that she doesn't represent the Russian government, only herself. She also said she ""couldn't have had"" information on Hillary Clinton.
""If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,"" Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges the younger Trump posted to Twitter.
The emails, dated early June, show Goldstone telling Trump that singer Emin Agalarov and his father, Moscow-based developer Aras Agalarov, had ""helped along"" the Russian government's support for Trump. The elder Agalarov was involved with Trump in hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. The two men also had preliminary discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow that fell through. Trump also appeared in a music video with the younger Agalarov.
Goldstone at one point said he could send the information to Trump's father first directly ""via Rhona,"" an apparent reference to the elder Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff.
The email release followed days of evolving accounts from Trump Jr. about the nature of the meeting and its purpose. The president's son posted the emails only after they were obtained by The New York Times.
On Saturday, Trump Jr. described the encounter as being a ""short introductory meeting"" focused on the disbanded program that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended the adoptions in response to Magnitsky Act sanctions created in response to alleged human rights violations in Russia.
A day later, Trump Jr. changed his account, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information ""helpful"" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton.
In his third description of what occurred, on Tuesday, Trump Jr. said he had believed the information he would hear about Clinton would be political opposition research. He said that he first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didn't work out, he was told that the attorney would be in New York ""and I decided to take the meeting.""
""The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official,"" Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. ""And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.""
The Trump Organization has confirmed the authenticity of Trump Jr. posts on Twitter releasing the email chain.

0000889,France sets up tax dept to investigate Jews,"Tel Aviv (Tribune News Service) - In Paris's 12th arrondissement, on Bercy Street by the banks of the River Seine, on the 13th floor of the Ministry of Finance is France's tax authority headquarters. Something has been afoot there recently that is liable to upset French Jews and spook their relations with the country in which they live. Under the radar, a secret department has been created with the sole purpose of handling tax evasion by French Jews. ""Globes"" can reveal for the first time the details of the secret department that is targeting Jews in France and new immigrants from France in Israel.
Sources inform ""Globes"" that over the past year, the tax authority in the Fifth Republic founded a special department for dealing with French Jews. The department currently has 20 Hebrew-speaking employees, and is in the process of hiring five more. This extraordinary department is one of a kind. Tax authorities do not usually establish departments targeting a specific nationality or religion. The action is astonishing, especially when the country involved is France, which is constitutionally defined as a secular republic that refrains from ""marking"" people according to their religion. Tax authorities around the world do establish teams to deal with sectors whose tax reporting is questionable. They target a specific market when there is concern that it contains a large amount of unreported capital, such as the real estate market or the diamond market. Setting up a specific department dealing with a designated nationality or religion, however, is not an accepted practice.
The only ""department"" ostensibly close in character to this secret French department is a new department established in the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for dealing with cases of Israelis, American-Israelis, and Americans with assets and money in Israel. This US department, however, resulted from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) signed by Israel and the US, in which huge amounts of information are transferred by the countries about their taxpayers, and someone has to handle that information. This was not the purpose for which the department was set up in the French tax authority.
The French department was established to handle French Jewish tax evaders, and hired employees with professional experience and a profound understanding of Israeli law in order to examine whether Jews were using these laws to evade tax in France. The aim of the department is to catch French tax evaders using Israel as a tax shelter.
Examining real estate deals An international lawyer specializing in taxation who is familiar with the secret department says, ""It is very, very irregular to hire 20 Hebrew-speaking employees, or any other language, in a foreign tax authority. Most tax authorities have one or two Hebrew-speakers, and there are English or French-speaking employees in Israel for the purpose of signing conventions and conducting relations with the tax authorities of other countries. Every tax authority has employees that speak a foreign language, but hiring 20 or more Hebrew-speaking investigators is very irregular."" The lawyer adds that he learned from his acquaintance with the department and its employees that some of the employees hired previously lived in Israel. ""They hired Hebrew-speaking French people, some of whom previously lived in Israel and moved back to France,"" he told Globes. According to information obtained by Globes, as part of the department's activity, its employees take out Land Registry extracts in Israel for the purpose of examining deals contracted in Israel and reaching French residents who have acquired properties here. The investigators have mapped the main streets in various cities in Israel, including Tel Aviv, Herzliya, Ra'anana, Netanya and Jerusalem, in which many purchases by Jewish residents of France take place. They have obtained Land Registry extracts and examined the particulars of a deal in order to detect foreign passport numbers. The investigators cross-referenced the information with information in their databases and the reports by those French Jews about their assets and income. In cases in which it was found that the person did not report the properties he bought in Israel, he was also summoned for questioning.
Sources inform Globes that a French Jew recently went to the secret department for an ""audit"" without knowing exactly what was to be discussed. For safety's sake, he took his lawyer with him - a fact that proved extremely important for him. During the discussion about his declarations of his assets and funds, the questioners very quickly presented a Land Registry extract including all of the French Jewish client's housing units in Israel. The discussion took place, and at the end, the lawyer wondered in what framework the new investigation was taking place. A seemingly innocent casual conversation in the corridor with one of the investigators revealed the amazing fact that a special department for dealing with French Jews and their tax evasion was involved.
Targeting immigrants to Israel from France, French Jewry boosts demand for Israeli homes not because of antisemitism, but for love of Israel. Through the special division, in addition to mapping the properties of French people in Israel, the tax authority in France has begun direct interrogations of Jewish residents of France who are in the midst of immigrating to Israel, and examining whether they possess money or assets that they did not previously declare, and whether this is the reason why they decided to immigrate to Israel.
According to figures from the Israel Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, i
These figures are surprising to no one. Massive purchases of properties in Israel by French people have been spoken of for years, some by immigrants and some not, and a number of international investigations were opened against French people on suspicion of tax offenses and evasion on an enormous scale in France and laundering money in Israel through real estate purchases. These developments apparently attracted the attention of the French tax authority, which decided to target French Jews.
The sources also told Globes that the French tax authority is one of the main tax authorities that contacts the Israel Tax Authority in order to obtain information about French residents with exceptionally large assets in Israel, compared with other countries, but many of the requests are rejected. ""They call the Israel Tax Authority almost every day with requests for information about some person or other, but many of the requests are rejected, because they do not meet the conditions of the conventions on exchanges of information. ""They are just fishing,"" says a source involved in information exchanges between the two countries.
The French embassy in Israel said in response, ""In the framework of the campaign against tax evasion, the authorities in France conduct investigations concerning individual cases, in accordance with the international agreements. The authorities in France deny the existence of a special department. It is extremely important to state that the things that were written are false.
""Taxes in France are calculated according to risk considerations. There is therefore no connection whatsoever to the national affiliation or ethnic origin of taxpayers. Next year, automatic exchanges of information are scheduled between OECD member countries."" ©2017 the Globes (Tel Aviv, Israel) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency.

0000890,[★BREAKING] 14-Year-Old Korean Girl Brutally Attacked By 5 Students,"WARNING: This article contains graphic photos of the victim and video from the brutal attack on her.
A group of four middle school students brutally beat another student, nearly murdering her in the process.
The horrific event was captured fully on camera. It shows the victim being beaten with a chair, a metal pipe, soju bottles and lit cigarettes.
Three of the attackers are 14 years old, while one is still 13 years old. The victim is also 14 years old.
They attacked her for 1 hour and 30 minutes straight and took photos of her bloody body.
After the attack, one of the girls sent a photo to another student, bragging about what she had done.
Student: What did you do? Attacker: I hit a kid. They say it’s attempted murder. Student: Sigh [Photo of victim] Attacker: Is it too much? Student: You did that? Student: Was it just you two? Student: Did you hit her alone? You’re a real psycho ㅋㅋ Did you both do it? Answer me. Answer me you b*tch. Are you really sending that to me and asking me if that’s too much? Wow. Until when are you going to keep doing that ㅋㅋ I’m getting really sick of you. You’ve already done enough, you should control yourself now. Attacker: Sorry. I’ll act properly now. Student: Was it just you two? Attacker: Yeah Student: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
The unconscious victim lay beaten and bloody until discovered by a woman walking by. They called the police and she was immediately hospitalized.
“She was covered in blood and was lying on the floor, with a hat covering her face…”
— Witness
Hospital photos show extremely deep cuts that ripped her scalp open. Her face was unrecognizable after the brutal attack.
The attackers turned themselves into police, two hours after the initial attack. They confessed to the crime.
The attackers justified their attack by telling police that they “didn’t like the victim’s attitude”.
“We hit her because we didn’t like the way she talked and her attitude.”
— Attackers
The victim’s mother made a statement on her Facebook and uploaded photos of her daughter, after the attack. It wasn’t the first time she was attacked.
“My daughter was beaten up a second time and her face is now a mess. They say the reason was because they wanted revenge for the last time we reported them.
Two months ago, a boy she knew contacted her. He was [one of the attacker’s] boyfriend. She was beaten up for picking up his call, and now she was beaten up for reporting the first attack.
Her forehead is bloated like there’s silicon in it. I was going to dismiss the previous incident, being a parent myself, but I don’t think this is right.
Reporters, please don’t write ridiculous things, I have a lot of evidence. I have an audio recording too, so don’t say she wasn’t injured too badly. My baby can’t even eat congee….
As a parent, I don’t like revealing everything, but why do you think I am? I just hope my daughter’s misfortune can help other kids from suffering the same fate.”
— Victim’s Mother, Han Joo Yeon
Korean netizens are flooding the mother’s post with support and expressing outrage at Busan police for how they handled the incident.
Koreans have questioned why police did not step in sooner after the victim filed her first complaint.
All four of the girls have been taken into custody for the horrific attack. However, the 13-year-old is protected under Juvenile Law and will not be detained, but can still face charges.
WARNING: The video is very violent and disturbing.

Amazingly, Jackson followed a nagging feeling that she should go back to Elmer. There was something about his demeanor that made her think he could use some help.
When she approached him and asked if she could help him in any way, his eyes filled up with tears. He replied, “I have colon cancer, and I have had a really bad accident. If I get up out of this cart everyone will know. What should I do?”
A lump grew in Jackson’s throat. It broke her heart to see the loss of dignity spread across the man’s sad face.
Jackson quietly approached Kroger employees, who kindly assisted as well. They allowed him access to the employee’s bathroom so that Elmer would have more privacy.
They gave him wipes and new clothing. As he walked out, he continued to cry out of both embarrassment over the accident and gratitude for the help.

He apologized for the inconvenience, but said he had to leave quickly. He was worried about leaving his wife home alone for much longer.
Amazingly, he found that somebody had already paid for and bagged his groceries! Jackson and Elmer hugged and cried together.
Instead of being ignored and left to deal with the mess himself, he was taken care of with dignity and respect. He no longer felt forgotten by his country.

During a fun day on the Black Sea full of sailing and swimming, they ventured out way beyond the mainland.
It wasn’t until the family was passing a remote island that they heard an unusual sound. At first, all they could make out was a faint black creature yelping from a cluster of rocks near the shore of the island.
“The sound gradually intensified. At first it was nearly invisible, but then I could see this black spot moving in the distance,” said Natalia Nikitina.

After the dramatic rescue, the family decided to bring her home and adopt her! They named their new kitten Aurora and her is now living happily with Natalia’s mother.

0000894,Is Illegal Immigration Responsible for the Decline in Labor Force Participation?,"Why are prime-age men dropping out of the labor force? And what can we do about it? A few days ago the Two Jasons tackled this question and came up with very different answers.
How about restricting low-skill immigration to encourage recruitment of Americans? No, Furman says, because — well, actually, he does not mention immigration at all, not even to dismiss its importance. Omitting the i-word in discussions of labor-force dropout is an unfortunate habit on both the left and the right. Amy Wax and I wrote our Inquirer op-ed (based on a much longer essay in American Affairs) to show that employers turned to immigrants as the native work ethic declined. As evidence, we point both to the much higher labor-force participation of low-skill immigrants compared to low-skill natives, as well as to the near-universal preference expressed by employers for immigrant labor. Restricting the flow of foreign workers would generate a major incentive for business owners, politicians, and opinion leaders to reintegrate American men into the labor force. It is, in our opinion, a crucial part of any reform strategy.
I don’t have a huge dog in this fight since, by lefty standards anyway, I’m pretty open to policies that humanely restrict illegal immigration. But I have a couple of questions for Jason R that I’m genuinely interested in. First, there’s this:
Labor force participation of women rose steadily starting with the feminist revolution of the 60s. However, participation peaked in the late 90s and has been declining ever since. In other words, for the past couple of decades this is a problem that’s not restricted just to men. Is illegal immigration affecting the labor force participation of women the same way?
Second, if illegal immigration really is a factor, then labor force participation of native workers should be correlated with the amount of illegal immigration. But it doesn’t seem to be:
I don’t want to make too much of this, since the Great Recession obviously had a big impact on both illegal immigration rates and labor force participation. Still, overall labor participation turned down in 2000 and then turned down even more in 2009. But illegal immigration rates didn’t change in 2000, and then changed in the wrong direction in 2009. Lower immigration rates should have increased labor force participation. What’s more, labor force participation among men has been dropping steadily since the 60s, with the rate hardly changing at all even as illegal immigration has spiked up and down.
There are so many other, bigger factors that affect labor force participation that I don’t really expect much from this comparison. But I’d expect at least a glimmer of something if unauthorized workers from Mexico really are causing native workers to just give up on the job market. Why don’t we see anything?",unknown,True

The EPI researchers clustered states based on the level of protection their laws afford to the earnings of tipped employees. According to their analysis, 28 states fall into what basically translates into the least protective category, meaning they do the poorest job of making sure that employees’ tips make it home with them. These are the states most vulnerable to the rule change. (Some of that vulnerability stems from them falling outside of enforcement guidelines flowing from rulings in the

I’d have to go to the Feds, and what Trump is essentially doing is saying that at the federal level, he’s going to legalize employers stealing from their workers.”

0000898,"L’Affaire Moore, &c.","The tragedy in Alabama, the tragedy in Venezuela, the arrogance of presidents, a medal ceremony in the Persian Gulf, and more
If you’re Roy Moore’d out, I don’t blame you. But I’d like to make a few Moore points nonetheless. (I didn’t mean that as a pun, I really didn’t.)
From what he has said over the years, Moore regards the 9/11 attacks as punishment for America’s sins. I wonder whether he sees his current predicament in a similar light. It would be interesting to see him address this at some point (after the election, surely).
‐A lot of good Alabamians, no doubt, contributed to Moore’s charity, the Foundation for Moral Law. (Wonderful name, wonderful concept.) He ripped them off, using the foundation as a personal piggy bank. And now he has ripped them off in another way, you could say: He has embarrassed them and the “cause.”
For years and years — ever since the Scopes trial in the 1920s — the religious Right has tried to escape the stigma of Gantryism. And time after time, the Roy Moores — the Jimmy Swaggarts, the Jim Bakkers, the Falwell Juniors — kill them.
At least that’s the way I see it …
‐Nigel Farage was one of the many people who rallied for Roy Moore in the Alabama primary. (The Right welcomes foreign interference, at least some of the time!) He saw the primary in a global light. Support of Moore, he said, was “important for the whole global movement across the West that we have built up and we have fought for.”
(Farage had just been in Germany, campaigning for that country’s alt-Right — a literal alt-Right, known as the AfD, which stands for “Alternative für Deutschland.”)
Has “the whole global movement” been harmed by the Moore affair?
‐Farage was doing his radio show the other day — a call-in show. In called Ahmed from Leyton, who had a point to make: People were talking about the Kremlin’s influence on America, but what about AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and Israel?
A good point, said Farage. “There are about 6 million Jewish people living in America, so as a percentage it’s quite small, but in terms of influence it’s quite big.”
Wrapping up, Farage thanked his “new caller from Leyton” and said, “He makes the point that there are other very powerful lobbies in the United States of America, and the Jewish lobby, with its links with the Israeli government, is one of those strong voices.”
Get the difference: The Kremlin is a foreign government, interfering in American elections; the “Jewish lobby” is composed of Americans, petitioning their government. And what is the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States? Christians United for Israel, with more than 2 million members.
Perhaps Mr. Farage could mention them the next time he is highlighting the Jewish influence on America.
‐While we’re on the subject: A man posing as a Washington Post reporter was trolling around Alabama. He was offering cash in exchange for dirt on Roy Moore. Between $5,000 and $7,000! He was trying to discredit the Post’s reporting, of course.
And what was he calling himself? “Bernie Bernstein.” Interesting. Wonder if the name was chosen at random. Could just as easily have been “John Smith,” right? Or even “Lucy Hickenlooper.”
(This was the real name of Olga Samaroff, the pianist who married Leopold Stokowski, the conductor, who was also married to Gloria Vanderbilt, who is Anderson Cooper’s mother.)
‐Have you seen the Nicolás Maduro video? It’s great. Maduro, the boss of Venezuela, had already been criticized for gaining weight in the midst of a food crisis. Venezuelans are starving.
Maduro was giving a speech on live television. After he finished, he reached into his desk and pulled out an empanada, which he readily chomped. The cameras were still rolling.
“Not a good look,” as they say on Twitter.
To see it, go
‐We on the right often criticized President Obama for his arrogance, among other things. We often quoted something he said in 2008, when he was running: “I think that I’m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters. I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors. And I’ll tell you right now that I’m gonna think I’m a better political director than my political director.”
I thought of that when listening to President Trump — who was asked about all the vacancies at the State Department. “Let me tell you, the one that matters is me. I’m the only one that matters.” (This is a cousin of “L’Etat, c’est moi.”)
Here is Trump again: “The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me. I’ve always been great with money.”
This puts Obama in the shade, I think.
‐Bernie Sanders (not “Bernie Bernstein”) tweeted this: “We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. How is it possible that 2 months after Hurricane Maria half the people of Puerto Rico don’t have electricity?” The senator may be right about Puerto Rico: that reconstruction is going way too slow. I don’t know, as I have not studied the issue.
But I think I know this: If we are, indeed, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, it’s because we have steadfastly rejected the system that Senator Sanders would impose on us.
‐The Virginia gubernatorial race seems a thousand years ago, I know. But I’d like to mention this: The GOP gave the impression that they liked immigrants less than Confederates. This is, I think, a bad impression.
How can you propose a sensible immigration policy, and staunchly oppose illegal immigration, without coming off as anti-immigrant? For one thing, you can point out that immigration has been a boon to this country. To us all. We owe our very presence here to immigration.
That is not too elementary to point out. And it might make the “medicine” of restrictionism go down better.
‐A musician friend of mine writes something funny (maybe inadvertently so): “How is ‘molto moderato’ not a contradiction? What the hell does it mean?”
“Very moderate.” Heh. True. Kind of a puzzler. I think it might mean “determinedly moderato. Don’t you budge from it!”
‐I learned something, and saw something, via Tom Gross. The video is
A big international judo competition was held in Abu Dhabi. Israelis participated — though they were the only participants forbidden to attach their national flag to their clothing. One of them, Tal Flicker, won a gold medal.
At the medal ceremony, flags of the place-finishers were raised. But not the Israeli flag. In its place — the gold-medal position — was the flag of the International Judo Federation. The Israeli national anthem (“Hatikvah”) was not played. In its place was the anthem of the International Judo Federation. (Who knew?)
There on the stand, the gold medalist sang his national anthem anyway. “The anthem that they played from the world federation was just background noise,” he later said. “I was singing ‘Hatikvah’ from my heart.”
So great, so great.
‐I returned to the United States from abroad the other day. There were two lines at the airport: “U.S.” and “Non-U.S.” Oh, give me a break. “Non-U.S.”! People are terrified to say “foreign.”
Remember when Ted Turner forbade CNN to say “foreign”? You had to say “international” (which has a different meaning).
Golf announcers, announcing PGA Tour events, speak of foreign players as “international players.” Oh, you mean the guy holds multiple passports? He’s from Trieste or something?
So silly, so unnecessary. Anthony Daniels — a.k.a. Theodore Dalrymple — says that he likes being a foreigner: He likes the status of foreigner, he likes being in countries not his own. Anyone can understand this.
‐Earlier this week, I passed a restaurant called “Mexicue.” Now, I love Mexican food and barbecue above most things on earth. What about the combination? Heaven? Or more like a hell? Two great things are not necessarily great combined. (Fruit and chocolate, my sister would argue, and I tend to agree.)
I’ll let you know …

The good, decent Christian morals and values that this country is built upon have been attacked and erased by the liberal left. So ultimately some godless, gutless, slime ball is going to think, why not?
It’s Liberals who have attacked the gospel underpinnings of this nation, creating a society where unborn babies are considered non-human organisms that can be butchered and killed as they see fit. Perverts who raised their children to be transsexual used to be put in jail.
Now Liberals and the liberal media lift them up as wonderful and desirable.
And anyone who opposes even this are they themselves considered to be evil and hated by Liberals. So within this godless vacuum, some think why not?
So thank you to the Liberal Democrat politicians, godless lowlifes that they are, for craftily blaming others for what they have unleashed upon our society. And the same also to all those who support them, and to others who remain silent and never speak out against this liberal evil.

Every year, there are nearly 12,000 firearm homicides in our country. That’s more people than live in Catawba, Claremont, and Conover, combined.
According to a study published in The American Journal of Medicine, compared with 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. Why?
It comes down to regulations, enforcement, education, and expectations – in short, the culture.
One pundit, Bill O’Reilly, blogged that gun violence is “the price of freedom.” I disagree. My vote is with the majority of Americans who support firearm control. I don’t mean outlawing them, but enacting sensible policies on background checks, silencers, and assault weapons, to name a few.
What will it take? Thoughtful lawmakers who will consider and support reasoned legislation.
Let’s look at our representatives. At the federal level, we have Sen. Richard Burr, who voted against a ban on assault weapons, and Sen. Thom Tillis, who voted against prohibiting the transfer of firearms to suspected terrorists.
Last year, both senators voted against universal background checks for firearms purchases.
Our congressman, Patrick McHenry, says on his website that he is “currently a co-sponsor of legislation that will protect Second Amendment rights, including the SAFE Act and National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, allowing for concealed carry reciprocity among states.”
He earned an A rating from the National Rifle Association, while State Sen. Andy Wells has received an NRA 93 percent rating. State Rep. Jay Adams sponsored the “Constitutional Carry Act,” which would allow any U.S. citizen 18 years or older to be able to carry a concealed handgun, unless otherwise disallowed by state or federal law. What is the sense in that?
Responsible gun owners tell me the N.C. permitting process is reasonable and sound. Why let someone, like me, carry a weapon without checking whether I understand the weapon and safety?
Remember the lesson relearned from Watergate? Follow the money. In 2016, the NRA gave Donald Trump, Burr, and five other Senate candidates $50.2 million (Burr got $6.2 million, the biggest chunk after Trump).
Imagine how much education, and more, you could fund for $50.2 million? You could even train people in firearm safety.
At this point, after 477 days with 521 mass shootings, I’m with Rosanne Cash, who says, “The NRA funds domestic terrorism.”

0000900,The Truth About Russiagate: What the Media Doesn’t Want You to Know,"(
And, if you think the pillars of the U.S. mainstream media – The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN and others – will apply some quality controls, you haven’t been paying attention for the past year or so. The MSM is just as unethical as the NGOs are.
So, we are now in a phase of Russiagate in which NGO “scholars” produce deeply biased reports and their nonsense is treated as front-page news and items for serious discussion across the MSM.
Yet, there’s even an implicit confession about how pathetic some of this “scholarship” is in the hazy phrasing that gets applied to the “findings,” although the weasel words will slip past most unsuspecting Americans and will be dropped for more definitive language when the narrative is summarized in the next day’s newspaper or in a cable-news “crawl.”
For example, a Times
The story, which fits neatly into the current U.S. propaganda meme that the Russian government somehow is undermining American democracy by stirring up dissent inside the U.S., quickly spread to other news outlets and became the latest “proof” of a Russian “war” against America.
However, before we empty the nuclear silos and exterminate life on the planet, we might take a second to look at the Times phrasing: “a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia.”
The vague wording doesn’t even say the Russian government was involved but rather presents an unsupported claim that some Twitter accounts are “suspected” of being part of some “network” and that this “network” may have some ill-defined connection – or “links” – to “Russia,” a country of 144 million people.
It’s like the old game of “six degrees of separation” from Kevin Bacon. Yes, perhaps we are all “linked” to Kevin Bacon somehow but that doesn’t prove that we know Kevin Bacon or are part of a Kevin Bacon “network” that is executing a grand conspiracy to sow discontent by taking opposite sides of issues and then tweeting.
Yet that is the underlying absurdity of the Times article by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Scott Shane. Still, as silly as the article may be that doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous. The Times’ high-profile treatment of these gauzy allegations represents a grave danger to the world by fueling a growing hysteria inside the United States about being “at war” with nuclear-armed Russia. At some point, someone might begin to take this alarmist rhetoric seriously.
Yes, I understand that lots of people hate President Trump and see Russiagate as the golden ticket to his impeachment. But that doesn’t justify making serious allegations with next to no proof, especially when the outcome could be thermonuclear war.
However, with all those millions of dollars sloshing around the NGO world and Western academia – all looking for some “study” to fund that makes Russia look bad – you are sure to get plenty of takers. And, we should now expect that new “findings” like these will fill in for the so-far evidence-free suspicions about Russia and Trump colluding to steal the presidency from Hillary Clinton.
If you read more deeply into the Times story, you get a taste of where Russiagate is headed next and a clue as to who is behind it:
“Since last month, researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, have been publicly tracking 600 Twitter accounts — human users and suspected bots alike — they have linked to Russian influence operations. Those were the accounts pushing the opposing messages on the N.F.L. and the national anthem.
“Of 80 news stories promoted last week by those accounts, more than 25 percent ‘had a primary theme of anti-Americanism,’ the researchers found. About 15 percent were critical of Hillary Clinton, falsely accusing her of funding left-wing antifa — short for anti-fascist — protesters, tying her to the lethal terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and discussing her daughter Chelsea’s use of Twitter. Eleven percent focused on wiretapping in the federal investigation into Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, with most of them treated the news as a vindication for President Trump’s earlier wiretapping claims.”
So, let’s stop and unpack this Times’ reporting. First, this Alliance for Securing Democracy is not some neutral truth-seeking organization but a neoconservative-dominated outfit that includes on
How many of these guys, do you think, were assuring us that Iraq was hiding WMDs back in 2003?
This group clearly has an ax to grind, a record of deception, and plenty of patrons in the Military-Industrial Complex who stand to make billions of dollars from the New Cold War.
The neocons also have been
The Times article also might have mentioned that Twitter has 974 million accounts. So, this alarm over 600 accounts is a bit disproportionate for a front-page story in the Times, don’t you think?
And, there’s the definitional problem of what constitutes “anti-Americanism” in a news article. And what does it mean to be “linked to Russian influence operations”? Does that include Americans who may not march in lockstep to the one-sided State Department narratives on the crises in Ukraine and Syria? Any deviation from Official Washington’s groupthink makes you a “Moscow stooge.”
And, is it a crime to be “critical” of Hillary Clinton or to note that the U.S. mainstream media was dismissive of Trump’s claims about being wiretapped only for us to find out later that
However, such questions aren’t going to be asked amid what has become a massive Russiagate groupthink, dominating not just Official Washington, but across much of America’s political landscape and throughout the European Union.
Beyond the obvious political motivations for this bias, we also have had the introduction of vast sums of money pouring in from the U.S. government, NATO and European institutions to
For example, last December, President Obama signed into law a $160 million funding mechanism entitled the “Combating Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act.” But that amounts to only a drop in the bucket considering already existing Western propaganda projects targeting Russia.
So, a scramble is on to develop seemingly academic models to “prove” what Western authorities want proven: that Russia is at fault for pretty much every bad thing that happens in the world, particularly the alienation of many working-class people from the Washington-Brussels elites.
The truth cannot be that establishment policies have led to massive income inequality and left the working class struggling to survive and thus are to blame for ugly political manifestations – from Trump to Brexit to the surprising support for Germany’s far-right AfD party. No, it must be Russia! Russia! Russia! And there’s a lot of money on the bed to prove that point.
There’s also the fact that the major Western news media is deeply invested in bashing Russia as well as in the related contempt for Trump and his followers. Those twin prejudices have annihilated all professional standards that would normally be applied to news judgments regarding these flawed “studies.”
On Thursday, The Washington Post ran its own banner-headlined
The “evidence” cited by Lankford’s office was one “Twitter account calling itself Boston Antifa that gives its geolocation as Vladivostok, Russia,” the Post reported.
By Thursday, Twitter had suspended the Boston Antifa account, so I couldn’t send it a question, but earlier this month, Dan Glaun, a reporter for Masslive.com,
In an email to me on Thursday, Glaun cited
And, by the way, there are
Another example of this mindless Russia bashing appeared just below the Post’s story on Lankford’s remarks. The Post
Of course, any Americans living in “battleground states” could tell you that they are inundated with all kinds of election-related “junk,” including negative TV advertising, nasty radio messages, alarmist emails and annoying robo-calls at dinner time. That’s why they’re called “battleground states,” Sherlock.
But what’s particularly offensive about this “study” is that it implies that the powers-that-be must do more to eliminate what these “experts” deem “propaganda” and “junk news.” If you read deeper into the story, you discover that the researchers applied a very subjective definition of what constitutes “junk news,” i.e., information that the researchers don’t like even if it is truthful and newsworthy.
The Post article by
“The researchers also categorized reports from Russia and ones from WikiLeaks – which published embarrassing posts about Democrat Hillary Clinton based on a hack of her campaign chairman’s emails – as ‘polarizing political content’ for the purpose of the analysis.”
So, this “study” lumped together “junk news” with accurate and newsworthy information, i.e., WikiLeaks’ disclosure of genuine emails that contained such valid news as the contents of Clinton’s speeches to Wall Street banks (which she was trying to hide from voters) as well as evidence of the unethical tactics used by the Democratic National Committee to sabotage Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign.
Also dumped into the researchers’ bin of vile “disinformation” were “reports from Russia,” as if everything that comes out of Russia is, ipso facto, “junk news.”
And, what, pray tell, is “conspiratorial political news”? I would argue that the past year of evidence-lite allegations about “Russian meddling” in the U.S. election accompanied by unsupported suspicions about “collusion” with the Trump campaign would constitute “conspiratorial political news.” Indeed, I would say that this Oxford “research” constitutes “conspiratorial political news” and that Timberg’s article qualifies as “junk news.”
Predictable Outcome
Given the built-in ideological bias of this “research,” it probably won’t surprise you that the report’s author, Philip N. Howard, concludes that “junk news originates from three main sources that the Oxford group has been tracking: Russian operatives, Trump supporters and activists part of the alt-right,” according to the Post.
I suppose that since part of the “methodology” was to define “reports from Russia” as “junk news,” the appearance of “Russian operatives” shouldn’t be much of a surprise, but the whole process reeks of political bias.
Further skewing the results, the report separated out information from “professional news organizations [and] political parties” from “some ‘junk news’ source,” according to the Post. In other words, the “researchers” believe that “professional news organizations” are inherently reliable and that outside-the-mainstream news is “junk” – despite the MSM’s long record of getting major stories wrong.
The real “junk” is this sort of academic or NGO research that starts with a conclusion and packs a “study” in such a way as to guarantee the preordained conclusion. Or as the old saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out.”
Yet, it’s also clear that if you generate “research” that feeds the hungry beast of Russiagate, you will find eager patrons doling out dollars and a very receptive audience in the mainstream media.
In a place like Washington, there are scores if not hundreds of reports generated every day and only a tiny fraction get the attention of the Times, Post, CNN, etc., let alone result in published articles. But “studies” that reinforce today’s anti-Russia narrative are sure winners.
So, if you’re setting up a new NGO or you’re an obscure academic angling for a lucrative government grant as well as some flattering coverage in the MSM, the smart play is to join the new gold rush in decrying “Russian propaganda.”

0000902,Ron Paul: What Did Washington Achieve in its Six Year War on Syria?,"(
Remember that President Obama initially involved the US military in Iraq and Syria to “prevent genocide” of the Yazidis and promised the operation would not drift into US “boots on the ground.” That was three years ago and the US military became steadily more involved while Congress continued to dodge its Constitutional obligations. The US even built military bases in Syria despite having no permission to do so! Imagine if Syria started building military bases here in the US against our wishes.
After six years of war the Syrian government has nearly defeated ISIS and al-Qaeda and the US-backed “moderates” turned out to be either Islamist extremists or Kurdish soldiers for hire. According to a recent report, the US has shipped two billion dollars worth of weapons to fighters in Syria via eastern Europe. Much of these weapons ended up in the hands of ISIS directly, or indirectly through “moderates” taking their weapons with them while joining ISIS or al-Qaeda.
“Assad must go,” proclaimed President Obama back in 2011, as he claimed that the Syrian leader was committing genocide against his own people and that regime change was the only way to save Syrians. Then earlier this year, when eastern Aleppo was about to be liberated by the Syrian government, the neocons warned that Assad would move in and kill all the inhabitants. They warned that the population of eastern Aleppo would flee from the Syrian army. But something very different happened. According to the UN’s International Organization for Migration, 600,000 refugees returned to Syria by August. Half of the returnees went back to Aleppo, where we were told Assad was waiting to kill them.
What happened? The neocons and “humanitarian interventionists” lied. Just as they lied about Libya, Iraq, and so on.
While it was mostly ignored by the mainstream media, just this week a Christian was elected speaker of the Syrian parliament. The new speaker is a 58-year-old Orthodox Christian law graduate and member of President Assad’s Baath party.
How many Christians does our “ally” Saudi Arabia have in its parliament? Oh I forgot, Saudi Arabia has no elected parliament.
Why does it seem that US policy in the Middle East always hurts Christians the most? In Iraq, Christians suffered disproportionately from the 2003 US invasion. In fact there are hardly any Christians left. Why aren’t more US Christian groups demanding that the US get out of the Middle East?
The US is not about to leave on its own. With ISIS all but defeated in Syria, many in Washington are calling for the US military to continue its illegal occupation of parts of the country to protect against Iranian influence! Of course before the US military actions in Iraq and Syria there was far less Iranian influence in the region! So US foreign interventionism is producing new problems that can only be solved by more US interventionism? The military industrial complex could not have dreamed of a better scheme to rob the American people while enriching themselves!
What have we achieved in Syria? Nothing good.

Authorities with San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit service are refusing to release surveillance videos of several crimes because doing so “would create a high level of racially insensitive commentary toward the district.”
Over the last three months, there have been at least three robberies on BART trains, but footage of those crimes won’t see the light of day, if officials with the transportation service get their way, KPIX-TV
John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters.
Debora Allen, a member of the BART board of directors, said she was told that releasing the video surveillance “would create a racial bias in the riders against minorities on the trains.”
Allen, unsatisfied with what she had been told, emailed BART assistant general manager Kerry Hamill about the issue, writing: “I don’t understand what role the color of one’s skin plays in this issue [of whether to divulge information]. Can you explain?”
Hamill replied: “If we were to regularly feed the news media video of crimes on our system that involve minority suspects, particularly when they are minors, we would certainly face questions as to why we were sensationalizing relatively minor crimes and perpetuating false stereotypes in the process.”
BART assistant general manager Kerry Hamill even went so far as to insinuate the only thing people are interested in are TV ratings and sensationalism concerning these videos. “They know that video of these events will drive clicks to their websites and viewers to their programs because people are motivated by fear,” Hamil said. You know… I don’t think that’s it dumbass. I think people are fearful of riding BART now, especially at night, because these thugs are violent and they don’t want to be robbed.
So, let me get this straight… BART doesn’t value their passengers as much as they do the racial sentiments of criminals. Interesting. According to BART spokesman Taylor Huckaby, state law protecting “juvenile police records” bars them from releasing the surveillance footage. He added that blurring out the faces of the minors would only lead people to pointlessly watch the videos. First off, if they aren’t caught, they don’t have a police record. Second, this isn’t about voyeurism of surveillance videos… it’s about identifying and catching criminals who are hurting and robbing others. You people are just nuts and you are idiots on top of it. People will start avoiding BART and I don’t blame them. They care less about their passengers than the criminals that attack them. Sick AND twisted.",unknown,True
0000904,BUSTED? NY Democrat To Linda Sarsour: Where’s the $100k You Raised for Jewish Cemetery?,"Islamic activist and Sharia law apologist Linda Sarsour has come under a lot of fire lately. She recently faced withering criticism after she called for “Jihad” against the Trump administration and has responded to her critics time and time again by accusing them of “Islamophobia.” But now,
Dov Hikind is a Brooklyn Democrat and a New York state assemblyman, and he slammed Sarsour for not giving money she promised to a Jewish cemetery that is in desperate need of repairs. Sarsour raised $100,000 for Golden Hill Cemetery in Lakewood, CO., but the cemetery director has said that they have not received a check, despite repeated calls.
Sarsour joined with Tarek El-Messidi, the founder of non-profit Islamic education organization Celebrate Mercy, in February and March to raise money from the Muslim community to go towards anti-semitic attacks and vandalism after Donald Trump’s election — a noble goal, indeed. And the Muslim community responded generously. Sarsour’s original goal was a mere $20,000, but they quickly soared past that goal. And some money was given. $50,000 was given to repair two Jewish cemeteries and a synagogue that had been vandalized. But the money promised to Golden Hill Cemetery has not materialized. And Hikind has called her out for it.
“Sarsour is a fraud,” Hikind said. “She talks out of both sides of her mouth. One minute she’s claiming to be a disciple of the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the next she’s standing with a terrorist on stage at an event [Rasmea Odeh], and singing praises of that terrorist to an audience. I won’t be the least bit surprised to hear that her little Jewish cemetery publicity stunt wasn’t quite what she made it out to be.”
“I understood that Sarsour’s fundraiser was just a publicity stunt meant to mask her efforts to hurt the State of Israel while glorifying her terrorist pals in various Tweets and speeches,” he continued. “But I also hoped that the money she raised would at least help these cemeteries. After all, Sarsour has no loss of affection for dead Jews. But this new report raises questions about where the money went. Perhaps if this story gets out, the shame will cause Sarsour to direct the funds to the people it was promised to. Then again, shame implies an elevated sense of self-awareness, and someone who glorifies terrorists is rarely sullied by a scruple.”
Ouch.
Sarsour wasted no time responding on Twitter.
She also went on a rambling Facebook rant, blaming the issue on “Zionists.” But it sounds like she’s going to need a much better excuse than that if she doesn’t pay up soon.",unknown,True
0000905,"Gatekeeper of DC Society Comes Out As Occultist, Admits Using Hex To Kill People","I have never been part of high society and I have been thankful for that small blessing my entire life. I view all people as the same until they prove otherwise. That proof for a woman named Sally Quinn just surfaced and it is dark and evil. She is the widow of Ben Bradlee, the Washington Post’s powerful executive editor from 1968 to 1991, who then served as the paper’s vice president until his death in 2014.
This power couple ruled the social scene in Washington, DC for nearly 50 years. They were hailed as the New Camelot. In fact, Bradlee had his career take off because of his friendship with John F. Kennedy. They decided who was ‘in’ and who was ‘out’, as if they were royalty and I guess in a way they were. They are the epitome of the elite… they are the very face of the Ruling Class in America. These are the people who have weaponized the media against middle America, against conservatives and Christians, against you and me.
It turns out that Sally Quinn is an occultist. I would never have believed it, but it is evidently so. According to her own memoir, she is a witch and has murdered three innocent people by way of a hex. One was a young woman who committed suicide after flirting with Quinn’s boyfriend at the time. Another was a magazine editor who published an unflattering profile of Quinn… he died of cancer decades later. Last but not least, her last victim was a psychic who died of a cerebral hemorrhage before the end of the year after telling Quinn something she did not want to hear. I have no idea what that was.
Now, I’m not sure I buy the whole ‘hex’ thing. But I do know the power of suggestion is very powerful. So is hatred and persecuting others you don’t like when you wield the kind of power Quinn does. Who knows? Either she’s delusional, insane and needs to be locked up, or she’s deeply evil and needs to be put down. Maybe both. The media is spinning it as her journey from atheism to magic in her quest for spirituality. I call it all kinds of wrong.
Quinn practiced the occult in the darkest ways possible into adulthood. She finally stopped, but not because she felt guilt or remorse: “She outs herself as a believer in the occult and as an erstwhile practitioner of voodoo … [and t]he book is awash in tales of Quinn’s occult prowess—she wants people to take this seriously, or at least to believe she takes this seriously. At the very least, she scared herself so badly when her third curse hit its mark—prompting a panic that her previous hexes had been karmically responsible for her son’s illness—that she vowed never to dabble in the dark arts again.” Gee, didn’t Hillary Clinton just discuss voodoo dolls and getting back at Comey, Trump and Congress for coming after her on her email scandal? What are the odds?
Quinn also plotted to break up Bradlee’s marriage (which she did) and used the threat of adultery to bend Bradlee to her will. Just as disturbing as these actions is the way the Washington Post outs them. in the Outlook section under the matter-of-fact headline, “Sally Quinn’s hexes, marital ultimatums and visceral love of her son,” they casually tell of Quinn’s occult endeavors. The piece was written by Connie Schultz and she had an odd criticism of Quinn: “Had Sally Quinn stayed true to the promise of her book’s whimsical title, “Finding Magic: A Spiritual Memoir,” she might have led readers on a journey of self-exploration as she shared her stories of hope and the many faces of faith in the aftermath of despair.”
This comes out and no one bats an eye over it. Call me crazy, but a powerful socialite who controls one of the biggest media outlets in the US coming out as an occultist is a bombshell. It’s discussed as casually as plastic surgery or sex. This same Ruling Class jokes about hexing President Trump as well. There has been all sorts of rumors in the media about those in DC, especially on the left, who are involved in witchcraft and occultism. Most of them I discount. But as more and more is admitted like this about Quinn, you start to wonder.
With all the character assassination, the stoking of racial conflict, the hate campaigns, the advocating of violence, the unending cultural bigotry and the communist agendas, I find myself wondering if all that goes on among the elite goes well beyond corruption and into much darker realms. In my opinion, there is no doubt these people are evil. But coming out of the demonic closet is something else. SMH.",unknown,False

Comey told lawmakers in the close door session that he raised his concern with the attorney general that she had created a conflict of interest by meeting with Clinton’s husband, the former President Bill Clinton, on an airport tarmac while the investigation was ongoing.
During the conversation, Comey told lawmakers he confronted Lynch with a highly sensitive piece of evidence, a communication between two political figures that suggested Lynch had agreed to put the kibosh on any prosecution of Clinton.
Comey said “the attorney general looked at the document then looked up with a steely silence that lasted for some time, then asked him if he had any other business with her and if not that he should leave her office,” said one source who was briefed.
It’s beyond obvious to anyone paying attention that Lynch suppressed evidence against Clinton. She was and is corrupt. Comey was dismissed from Lynch’s presence because she knew what he had shown her was the truth. In a Twitter post Tuesday, President Donald Trump weighed in on the revelation, writing, “A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes…gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!” Yes, it was. But I still don’t understand why Trump let Clinton walk as well.
Comey has repeatedly said that Lynch tried to get him to use certain phrasing concerning the investigation into Clinton’s dealings. By the way, he’s been saying this for months. Everyone acted as though it was new during the hearing… it wasn’t. But we all knew this to be the case. The challenge is that no one did anything about it. Comey may have been bullied by Lynch, but in the end, he didn’t do the right thing. He’s lied and manipulated his way through all of this and his credibility is entirely gone. But this description of Lynch definitely has the ring of truth to it. It certainly doesn’t surprise me.",unknown,True

So, the environmental revolutionaries are on the move and I might remind everyone that they are radicals that commit terrorist acts here in the US. This is also part and parcel of the global warming cult.

According
The
“The Labor 2016 program sought to ‘elect Hillary Clinton and pro-worker candidates across the country,’” according to the OSC report.
Postal workers from North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin and Nevada took part in this. The government found out about the blatant violation of the Hatch Act when a whistleblower from Wisconsin came forward. This person contacted their congressional representatives to inform them that they thought the election was impeding the work of the US Postal Service. This prompted an investigation.

0000909,"Hillary Clinton Slams Trump, Says Campaign Comforted Millions of White People [VIDEO]","Major face palm. SMH. Hillary, you really need to shut it and just go walk in the woods for a few years… maybe forever. You are doing far more harm to yourself than good. Now she is saying that President Trump comforted “millions of white people” with his campaign during an interview airing Sunday on CBS. That’s right… she’s calling everyone who is white a racist. I’m sure her intent was to call Trump one, but once again… open mouth, insert hoof. “He was quite successful in referencing the nostalgia that would give hope, comfort, settle grievances, for millions of people who were upset about gains that were made by others,” Clinton leveled at Trump’s campaign.
“What you’re saying is millions of white people,” host Jane Pauley stated. “Millions of white people,” Clinton confirmed. “Yeah, millions of white people.” Wow… way to alienate most of America in one fell swoop. That’s worse than the slur of ‘baskets of deplorables’ and I thought that was the gaff to end all gaffs. She did address that piece of stupidity as well and made it even worse. Instead of apologizing for insulting so many people, she blamed… you guessed it… Trump. She said she regretted handing Trump a political gift, but also for saying a “large number of people” didn’t care about Trump’s behavior. She still doesn’t get it. She never will.
The interview was pre-taped yesterday. Pauley asked Clinton about her so-called ‘surprising’ defeat. No one is surprised by it except Clinton and the left, But I digress. She wanted to know what derailed Clinton’s campaign that was “supposed to make history” by electing her the first female president of the United States. In a word, Hillary. But that’s not how the Hildabeast sees it of course. She blamed it on stereotypes, sexism and misogyny. She insinuated that people were just too backward and stupid to wrap their teeny tiny brains around a woman being president. No, Hillary… it’s you, not your sex, that people couldn’t stomach.
John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters.
In the interview, Clinton said she knew she was going to have to “have to work extra hard to make women and men feel comfortable with the idea of a woman president.” Instead, she should have worked extra hard to be an actual likable candidate. She should have not kept on committing crimes and lying about them. She should have given a damn about Americans in general. But she did none of that. Then Donald Trump happened to her and she royally deserved it.
While Hillary is promoting her book and blaming anyone and anything but herself for her loss of the presidency, the rest of America is either bored by her, amused at her stupidity or angry that no one seems interested in prosecuting this shrew. This part of the interview I found particularly ironic… Clinton did give one direct answer to Pauley’s question about things she did that cost her the election. “Oh, I think the most important of the mistakes I made was using personal email,” she said, referring to her use of a private server for official State Department business. Bwa ha ha ha ha! Ya think? She should have gone to prison for that alone, but alas, DC is covering for her yet again.
In the closing of the interview, Hillary shows yet again that she is beyond clueless and doesn’t understand Americans at all. “I believed that it was my responsibility to try to offer answers to it, not to fan it,” she said of the public’s anger over the financial crisis. “I think, Jane, that it was a mistake because a lot of people didn’t wanna hear my plans. They wanted me to share their anger. And I should’ve done a better job of demonstrating I get it.” So, she just wasn’t angry enough. Not only does she think we are a bunch of racists and deplorables, she thinks we are unstable anger cases. That’s how little she thinks of Americans and how much she holds us in contempt y’all.",unknown,True
0000910,Slick Donald Trump Jr. BURNS Hillary After Supreme Court Ruling,"Hillary Clinton has not been a gracious loser towards Donald Trump. Ever since she lost, she’s been taking potshots at Trump every chance she gets. Unfortunately for Hillary, though, she’s just proven to be the loser… again. And Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr.,
In February, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court upheld a ruling that kept Trump’s travel ban from taking effect. Hillary wasted no time boasting about this “loss” on Twitter:
That tweet backfired on her pretty much immediately, with people pointing out that she didn’t have much of a track record to brag about herself.
Fast-forward to today, and the Supreme Court has now allowed for the travel ban to be partially reinstated. And Trump, Jr. decided to give Hillary a taste of her own medicine:
Ouch.
Other people on Twitter quickly piled on:
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hillary has yet to weigh in on the decision from the Supreme Court reinstating Trump’s travel ban. Maybe she’s finally learned her lesson about celebrating a victory too early and has learned, once and for all, to keep her mouth shut, especially when it comes to trashing Donald Trump.",unknown,True
0000911,5 Yr-Old Christian Girl Forced Into Muslim Foster Care,"The child has sobbed and begged not to go back to this foster home. I don’t blame her. Both of her female caretakers covered their faces with Islamic veils when they accompanied the child out of the house. This means they are Salafi-influenced Muslims, which is a puritanical form of Islam. The first foster caretaker, who she was with for four months, wore the niqab; the one she is living with currently wears a burqa. If a Muslim child were in the system, you can bet they would only place the child with Muslims. So again I ask… why was a Christian child placed in a Muslim home like this?
From
A white, Christian, five-year-old girl has been forced to live with Muslim foster carers who removed her cross, encouraged her to learn Arabic, and told her European women were alcoholics.
The five-year-old girl was put into the foster care system by scandal-ridden Tower Hamlets borough council, and has spent six months in two Muslim households against the parents’ wishes, reports The Times.
In local authority reports seen by the newspaper, a social services worker describes the sobbing child begging to not be returned to the foster home, saying “they don’t speak English”.
Another report, which describes the girl as “very distressed”, reads that the girl was not allowed to eat a carbonara meal because it had bacon in it (forbidden in Islam), and recorded claims she had her necklace and Christian cross pendant removed by one carer, and was allegedly encouraged to learn Arabic.
During a visit with her mother, the girl said she was told that “Christmas and Easter are stupid” and that “European women are stupid and alcoholic”.
The child should be in familiar surroundings and comforted as she is already traumatized from being separated from her parents. This is cruel and shows either a hatred of Christianity, or a stunning ignorance of religion. The Tower Hamlets borough council is known for widespread election fraud and was once controlled by Islamist-linked former mayor Lutfur Rahman, who was banned from public office for five years in April 2015 after facing allegations of rigging elections, serious corruption and using “undue spiritual influence” over voters. Now this.

In April of 2017, care and education regulator Ofsted pronounced Tower Hamlets children’s services as “inadequate,” with politicians and officials criticized for “widespread and serious failures in the services provided to children who need help and protection.” Only 31 percent of the borough is white. Schools in this area are said to be hotbeds of Islamic extremism. This is where a Christian couple was told by a social worker that christening their infant son would lessen the chances of him being adopted. This poor little girl doesn’t stand a chance here and will be forced to become a Muslim. Britain is lost.",unknown,True
0000912,"Loretta Lynch, Clinton Campaign, Soros Officials – ALL Called Into Senate PROBE","From Breitbart:
The Senate Judiciary Committee announced Friday it sent four investigatory letters, including one to former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters.
The letters, dated Thursday and signed by the committee’s bipartisan leadership, demand answers and documents related to the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, especially reports that Clinton campaign operatives expressed confidence Lynch would keep that investigation from “going too far.”
The demand comes as the Judiciary Committee investigates the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of ex-FBI Director James Comey, in which the material may take on a new significance.
This investigation has legs and is going to stick because there was actual intent and actions that went towards covering up corruption and crimes on Hillary Clinton’s part. The Department of Justice is sinking their teeth into this one. George Soros was in this up to his neck facilitating criminal activities. It would be a dream come true if he was nailed over all this.
Lynch’s meeting on the tarmac with Bill Clinton could be her undoing. There is surely an NSA tape of that conversation since it was on a government plane. When Comey was testifying to Congress over his being fired by President Trump, he threw Loretta Lynch under the bus over her instructing him to refer to the Clinton criminal investigation as a “matter” and that request “concerned and confused” him. Comey also hinted that there were further actions taken by Lynch with regard to the Clinton investigation “which I cannot talk about yet.” I would say there is an excellent chance that a number of people are going to go down over this. At least, I sure hope so.",unknown,True
0000913,"CNN: ‘Keep In Mind, Country Music Fans Are Likely Trump Supporters’ [VIDEO]","Son. Of. A. B*tch. If I despised CNN before, I detest them now. Especially Jeff Zeleny. He had the nerve to randomly point out that country music fans were probably Trump supporters. Like somehow, that makes it okay. 58 people are dead. Over 500 are hospitalized now. And this asshat is justifying it because conservatives tend to like country music and President Trump. He said this after President Trump conveyed his condolences to those in Las Vegas that were affected by this horrific tragedy. It’s the deadliest mass shooting in US history and Zeleny just couldn’t resist throwing in a political dig.
Zeleny is a senior White House correspondent. He should have his press pass and privileges yanked over that comment. I mean that. Zeleny said he found the speech to be “pitch perfect,” but then asked people to “keep in mind” that many country music fans are Trump supporters. WTH? So, because he couldn’t find fault with the President’s speech, he attacked those that died last night. Nice touch CNN. “Something else, I think, to keep in mind–a lot of these country music supporters are likely Trump supporters,” Zeleny said. “This is something, of course, hitting the tapestry of all Americans and there are going to be victims from across the country here.”
I’m beyond disgusted over this. I’m still in shock this happened in Las Vegas, which by the way, is one of the greatest cities in the world. It has its drawbacks, but I love Vegas. For twenty years it was my home and I know the city inside and out. The best years of my life were spent in Vegas and my best friend still lives there. Shame on CNN… you people are a bunch of soulless ghouls. Zeleny also noted a Trump hotel in the area before saying of the President: “So, this is something I’m not surprised at all to see him go there visiting early.” What the hell does that have to do with anything? Exactly, what is this jerk saying?
Obviously, he was trying to demean President Trump. Dozens of people are dead on the Strip and hundreds are wounded and that’s what CNN is concerned with? Scoring cheap shots off the President? You guys are just sick and twisted. I’ll leave you with this brief transcript while I go vomit. CNN is a disgrace. What a jackass.

JEFF ZELENY: By saying he will go to Las Vegas on Wednesday, by visiting, it is something that puts him in line with what so many presidents before him have done and paid their respects. Of course, Las Vegas is a town that he [Trump] is connected to and knows well. His name is emblazoned on the top of a hotel there as well. He campaigned there a lot. So, this is something I’m not surprised at all to see him go there visiting early. But, again, I think the moment here is what comes after this. This invariably after today and tomorrow, will become a discussion of politics, of guns. It’s not appropriate for that moment today. You will hear it from some Democrats. What will the President do in that respect? Will he take a leadership role in that respect? We will watch that as the days unfold, but the President clearly, as John said, striking a pitch-perfect tone there.
Something else, I think, to keep in mind, a lot of these country music supporters were likely Trump supporters. This is hitting that, of course, is hitting the tapestry of all Americans and there are going to be victims from across the country here. So this is something that is a national tragedy as the President said and the flags he ordered at half staff today in memory and thought of all of the victims in Las Vegas.",unknown,True
0000914,MSNBC’s Joan Walsh: ‘Really Good Research’ Proves Trump Voters Motivated By ‘Fears Of Brown People’,"The idea of liberals doing any sort of research, let alone “really good research,” is nothing short of absolutely laughable. The fact that Joan Walsh had the gall to get up and say that she researched something (or someone else researched it and she’s just parroting it without taking a gander into the facts) is humorous enough.
Yet more hilarious is the idea that “really good research shows” that Trump voters only elected the Republican President because of their “fear of brown people.”
Of course, what else would you expect from someone who penned a book literally titled: “What’s The Matter With White People?” If it’s not race related, that’s because you’re not looking hard enough.

While on MSNBC’s show AM Joy, Walsh took the time to remind all three of their viewers that white people are what’s wrong with the country and Trump is the result of our deep-seated fear of anyone who looks different than us. Which is rich coming from her. Projection, maybe?
“The really good research that’s taken place since the election shows that fear of a changing America is the number one factor that you can see drive––really divides a white Trump voter from a white non-Trump voter, that it’s fears of brown people, fears of losing the majority.”
She then went on to hawk up some baseless drivel about the Trump-Russia collusion nonsense. You know, going back to the talking points that – despite having been essentially debunked – sound good while bouncing around the leftist echo chamber.
“But you know what’s also sad to me is that this cohort, I wrote about my Irish Catholic working class family, this cohort used to be so patriotic, and so much America—love it or leave it, things that I didn’t like about it, but that was just so stirred by this country’s—what they perceived as its values and much of the same cohort is with Donald Trump—dismissing the Russia allegations, doing nothing to support the people who are trying to get answers, and I find this kind of relative, this relativity about well, you know, if my guy doesn’t think it’s important or if my guy might even be threatened by it, then I don’t care either. That is not patriotism. That is something else entirely.”

0000915,First Lady Shares 4th Of July Message That Her Haters CANNOT Argue,"Despite Melania’s elegance and quiet ways, she is the never ending target of the left’s unhinged hatred and vitriol. But she stiffens her spine, holds her head up high and moves forward letting all of that fall by the wayside. That’s the sign of a woman who is courageous and is used to fighting opponents. Compliments are few for our First Lady… they say she is too beautiful (is that possible?), too cold, too quiet, too aloof… it’s always something, when in reality she is none of those things. These detractors know nothing of Melania… they don’t know ‘her’. But what she feels in her heart and soul is laid bare for everyone to see.
From Allen West:
Our first lady, Melania Trump is sadly not exempt from the hatred and vitriol the left showers on her husband.
Mrs. Trump has been attacked for being too beautiful, too cold, too exotic and too quiet. She’s been attacked for making her son Barron the number one priority in her life. She’s been ripped to shreds over her modeling career and her marriage.
She’s been ridiculed for taking up the cause of “cyber bullying” when her husband is perhaps the world’s most notable user of Twitter, if not for bullying than certainly for “needling.”

Nonetheless she comports herself in public unfailingly with grace and composure.
Today she posted a message of Independence Day with which no one can possibly disagree.
“We are the land of the free because of the brave. Thank you to the heroes who serve!”
Few women comport themselves with the style, grace and dignity of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But Melania pulls it off effortlessly. The message she posted today to celebrate Independence Day is one that no one can argue with or deny. It goes towards who Americans truly are. We are only as good as our warriors and our protectors… and we should thank them every day. The Fourth of July is a very good day for thanking those that selflessly serve.
I’m going to agree with Michele Hickford over at Alan West’s place… this does not include the likes of Edward Snowden, Bowe Bergdahl or Bradley Manning. Traitors are not welcome here especially on this day. Thank you to those patriots who put their lives on the line for all of us. You are truly what makes this nation great.",unknown,True

Schultz is clearly delusional.
In a speech he gave to Starbucks workers, he let everyone feel a rock he brought back from Auschwitz and compared the slaughter of millions to what is going on now in America. The company published an article about the speech and quoted a new worker about what he got from the Schultz speech. He said:
“That rock represented the blood of millions who fell victim to something very similar to what we are facing now,” he said quietly.
These people have a fascist fetish and don’t realize that they are fascists themselves. Schultz insinuates that America is like the Holocaust in Nazi, Germany. Really? Actually, we didn’t have racial problems rise up again until Barack Obama came into office. Now, it is the weapon of choice for the left to bring President Trump down because the whole Russian farce didn’t pan out. What next? Aliens?
Starbucks is an overpriced luxury that I don’t find attractive. Once they started bringing politics in the mix, they became expendable in my world. Schultz should check his own personal white privilege before he starts lecturing Americans. I’m sick of all of this and I’m definitely fed up with the left pushing a race war for political purposes. Just say no to Starbucks.",unknown,True
0000917,[WATCH] DEMANDS That Whites Open Bank Accounts Solely to Pay Reparations For Their Ancestors Owning Slaves,"The idea of reparations has been around for a long time. Some activists believe that white Americans should be forced to pay black Americans whose ancestors were slaves. It’s not something that most people take seriously, but HBO host Bill Maher
Maher recently landed in hot water for using the n-word on his show “Real Time with Bill Maher” and he’s only just come back on the air. One of his first guests was Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson, who unsurprisingly lectured Maher about his racist slip-up.
“That’s our word, and you can’t have it back,” Dyson told Maher, who agreed. “I did a bad thing,” Maher responded. “For black folks, that word, I don’t care who you are, has caused pain. I’m not here to do that.” The real question, of course, is how Maher still has his job, but apparently celebrities can commit any manner of sins and have them excused, as long as they’re liberals.
Dyson seemed eager to give his forgiveness to Maher for something he did directly, but strangely, he’s not so eager to forgive every other white American for things they had nothing to do with. Dyson wants all white Americans to be forced to open bank accounts which would be used as an “individual reparations account,” with the money within given to black groups in an effort to make up for the history of slavery in America.
Never mind the countless white Americans who fought — and died — to end slavery.
“Look, if it doesn’t cost you anything, you’re not really engaging in change; you’re engaging in convenience,” he argued. “You’re engaged in the overflow. I’m asking you to do stuff you wouldn’t ordinarily do. I’m asking you to think more seriously and strategically about why you possess what you possess. That is what I meant by an I.R.A.: an individual reparations account.”
So even though white Americans living today had nothing to do with slavery, they should be forced to pay reparations for it? Sure, buddy.

0000918,Fmr Black Panther Takes to Social Media Calling For ACTION After Vegas Shooting ‘Our Culture Is Under Attack’ [VIDEO],"Mason Weaver, a former Black Panther, did an awesome video on the shooting in Las Vegas. In it he points out that it doesn’t matter whether it was a leftist, an Islamic extremist or a communist Antifa goon. The reason this happened is because our culture has changed and he’s right. Somewhere down the road, it became acceptable to hurt others and to kill if you felt offended enough. Everything has been uber politicized and the anger is being stoked by both sides. The results are deadly as you can see in Las Vegas with 58 dead and over 500 wounded.
We have forgotten what it means to be an American… to defend our culture and our way of life. To take pride in our country and our citizens, and yes, in our President. The killer knew he would become infamous for killing so many and probably hoped to hurt conservatives and the President by doing so. He wanted the infamy and he knew there was no way out for himself. That’s why he committed suicide before SWAT could get to him on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. As Weaver points out, this is not how we behave as Americans. And he’s also right when he says this guy didn’t just ‘snap’. This was pre-planned and well-organized. It was premeditated mass murder. He brought over ten weapons and checked into the hotel three days before the killing spree even happened. He was waiting for the perfect moment and carried out his plan meticulously.
Weaver calls this a cultural glitch in who we are as a people. Again, that is exactly right. This is the radical fringe. Think of it as a circle where the violent radicals congregate. It’s where fascists and communists meet… it’s where terrorists play. Instead of pulling together as Americans, we have Balkanized America. We have divided our country into smaller, mutually hostile groups. Now we have 28 different genders, homosexuals, African Americans, Native Americans and the list goes on and on and on. This was all part of a communist plan to tear us apart as a culture, a nation and as a society and we fell for it. Just ask an ex-Black Panther and he’ll tell you. There is no one who knows communism better than an ex-communist, or someone who knows terrorism better than an ex-terrorist.
It’s not in fashion to be American. People try to bully Americans and shame them for being patriotic and for loving their country. They label them as racist and violent, when for the overwhelming majority, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, you almost exclusively find the violence on the left with the communists who created this mess in the first place. We’ve allowed cowardly, wimpy, pansified leftists to take over our country and teach and control our children. Shame on all of us.
Americans know we are the freest, greatest nation on earth. Yet, we allow those who would destroy us and our way of life to control the narrative. It’s time to put all the division aside and declare that you are a proud American period. No race, no gender, no religion, no political affiliation… you are simply and greatly an American. Start acting like one.",unknown,False
0000919,Cast Your Eyes On This List of the First US Black President’s Accomplishments,"by Cassy Fiano
Since Donald Trump took office, liberals have immediately been reminiscing about the Obama administration, waxing poetic about how Barack Obama was the greatest president ever to sit in the Oval Office. But how much did Obama really accomplish while president? And was it even good? According to one source,
Barack Obama was the country’s first black president and so for liberals, that was all that mattered. But between 2008 and 2017, he sure did rack up a lot of accomplishments — although America’s Freedom Fighters points out that they aren’t necessarily good ones.
Here are a few of the highlights:
First President to preside over a cut to the credit-rating of the United States. First President to violate the War Powers Act. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters. First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat. First President to order a secret amnesty program that stopped the deportation of illegal immigrants across the U.S., including those with criminal convictions. First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees. First President to tell a CEO of a major corporation (Chrysler) to resign. First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space. First President to cancel the National Day of Prayer and to say that America is no longer a Christian nation. First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present. First President to arbitrarily declare an existing law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it. First President to threaten insurance companies if they publicly spoke out on the reasons for their rate increases. First President to tell a major manufacturing company in which state it is allowed to locate a factory. First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN). First President to side with a foreign nation over one of the American 50 states (Mexico vs Arizona). First President to tell the military men and women that they should pay for their own private insurance because they “volunteered to go to war and knew the consequences.” Then he was the First President to tell the members of the military that THEY were UNPATRIOTIC for balking at the last suggestion. (Thank God he didn’t get away with THIS one.) First president to allow Iran to inspect their own facilities. First president to have blood on his hands from Benghazi to the assassinations of several police officers. First president to trade 5 terrorist for a traitor First president to facilitate the Iranians to acquire nuclear weapons.
They also pointed out that Obama has broken quite a few records, too:

0000920,Chelsea Clinton Tweets About ‘Moms In Prison’ — Gets Mocked On Twitter Hilariously,"Last year’s
Which makes Chelsea Clinton’s recent tweet all the more awkward. See tweet below.
No doubt Chelsea has no idea the vitriol and resentment a great many Americans bear toward her mother, for her years and years of alleged lawless deeds and never being held to account for them. But Twitter let her know in a hurry that the irony of a Clinton tweeting about moms in prison, was just too good an opportunity to ignore.
The program Chelsea referred to in her tweet is the Girl Scouts of America’s “Girl Scouts Beyond Bars.” It enables young girls in the program to visit their incarcerated mothers, in a room that is more like a classroom instead of a typical prison visitation room. And no doubt the program is a good one that is filling a need. It has probably helped many young ladies to continue a relationship with their mother while she serves her sentence. And certainly no one faults Chelsea for supporting such a program.
But of course any reference by Hillary’s daughter to moms in prison is going to bring a big response from Americans who are tired of seeing Democrats get away with things that other Americans would never be able to do without repercussions.
So, to the GSA, good job on this program. It’s a benefit to young girls. But to Chelsea Clinton? There is talk of the DOJ opening investigations into Hillary’s list of questionable activities. And if there is any justice, it may be only a matter of time until you, Chelsea, have to visit your mom in prison.",unknown,True

It’s either irony, or some sort of hilarious prank played by Costco, because they know her book is so full of crap.
This is absolutely hilarious and for reasons you don’t quite understand, it will have you laughing for hours. The longer you look at it, the harder you will laugh.
From aspirations of life in the White House to signing copies of her books next to something that belongs in an outhouse, Hillary Clinton has had a difficult year. With all of the bullcrap that comes out of her mouth, perhaps Clinton should set up a permanent residence in that aisle.
Meanwhile, millennial protestors set up shop across the street to protest the appearance of Hillary, chanting “lock her up,” wearing MAGA hats and holding Trump campaign signs.
Watch the video below:
I genuinely want to feel bad for her, because to be this far along in your life and have absolutely nothing to show for it? That’s just sad. I mean, the only reason she’s even as important enough to sign books in a Costco is because she rode her husband’s coattails to fame. She’s done absolutely nothing to make a name for herself and anything she has done, such as her time as Secretary of State, has ended in abject failure and in the case of SoS, bloodshed. You can’t claim that as a success when your actions got innocent people killed when it could have been avoided.
We are watching her decline in relevance and influence in real time, and it’s fabulous. It couldn’t be happening to a nicer witch and I’m sure the Benghazi 4 and her other victims are watching from their perches in Heaven, enjoying some great beer and watching this the way most people would watch a football game.
I am just going to kick up my feet and watch her implode while America prospers and thrives under a Presidency that isn’t hers. This is the America that we have dreamed of during the last 8 years of the Obama administration and we’re actually here to witness it. It’s beautiful karmic justice and let’s not pretend she doesn’t deserve it. Even the left needs to recognize that she is a sinking ship and jump off like rats.
Perhaps not the best comparison.",unknown,True
0000922,Miley Cyrus Rolls Back On “Threat” To Leave America Because Trump- ‘I’m Not F*cking Leaving’,"You know. I can’t think of anyone more irrelevant and inept at traversing the heart of Americans everywhere and really relating to the rest of the world than Miley Cyrus.
The Disney child actor turned pop star adds as much contribution to society as her talent does to the music industry. Yes, I know she is actually successful. I’m just knocking on what a terrible, horrible voice she has. But now that we have the petty out of the way, let’s get down to the dirty. Where this young star likes to play.
Okay, that was the last one.
Cyrus gave NME Magazine an opportunity to interview her and it was during that interview that her mouth became an unceasing anti-Trump bugle. If you can remember, it was Cyrus along with a bunch of other dopey celebrities that vowed that they would be exiting the U.S. if the devil himself, Donald Trump was to win the White House.
Well, he won, and we are still waiting for these lying sacks of worthless cow dung to actually pull through with their ‘convictions’. Well, now it would seem that Cyrus herself has proclaimed that she will never leave, instead deciding to what?…You guessed it! Stay in the U.S. and FIGHT Trump with everything she’s got!
…America, are you as bored and fed up with the virtue signaling as I am?
Cyrus claims that she will attack Trump by fighting “hate with love.” Oh please, what a load of nonsense. These idiots’ idea of love is agreeing with everything they say. Love. Give me a break. The only love these degenerates like Cyrus have is love of themselves and anything that is like them. The only truth that Cyrus speaks during this whole mess of an interview is that she admits that her previous plan to leave the country if Trump won was completely ‘dumb’.
“I’m not leaving the country, that’s dumb. Because that’s me abandoning my country when I think I’ve got a good thing to say to my country. And trust me, I hear every day on my Instagram, ‘Just leave already! When are you going to leave?’ Wherever I am, my voice is going to be heard, and I’ll make sure of it.”
Oh please. One horribly sang pop song after another is all we need. Please! No more!
The dope went on to explain:
“I’m fighting hate with love. I’m doing this concert this week in Vegas and for ‘Party In The USA’ the screens will say ‘education’ and ‘healthcare’ and ‘equality’, ‘justice’, ‘freedom’, ‘liberation’, ‘expression.’ These things are what make up our country. It’s not a party in the USA if it’s filled with hate, discrimination, walls, violence, all these things.”
She has no idea what makes out country great…",unknown,True
0000923,MSNBC’s Joan Walsh: ‘Really Good Research’ Proves Trump Voters Motivated By ‘Fears Of Brown People,"The idea of liberals doing any sort of research, let alone “really good research,” is nothing short of absolutely laughable. The fact that Joan Walsh had the gall to get up and say that she researched something (or someone else researched it and she’s just parroting it without taking a gander into the facts) is humorous enough.
Yet more hilarious is the idea that “really good research shows” that Trump voters only elected the Republican President because of their “fear of brown people.”
Of course, what else would you expect from someone who penned a book literally titled: “What’s The Matter With White People?” If it’s not race related, that’s because you’re not looking hard enough.
John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters.
While on MSNBC’s show AM Joy, Walsh took the time to remind all three of their viewers that white people are what’s wrong with the country and Trump is the result of our deep-seated fear of anyone who looks different than us. Which is rich coming from her. Projection, maybe?
“The really good research that’s taken place since the election shows that fear of a changing America is the number one factor that you can see drive––really divides a white Trump voter from a white non-Trump voter, that it’s fears of brown people, fears of losing the majority.”
She then went on to hawk up some baseless drivel about the Trump-Russia collusion nonsense. You know, going back to the talking points that – despite having been essentially debunked – sound good while bouncing around the leftist echo chamber.
“But you know what’s also sad to me is that this cohort, I wrote about my Irish Catholic working class family, this cohort used to be so patriotic, and so much America—love it or leave it, things that I didn’t like about it, but that was just so stirred by this country’s—what they perceived as its values and much of the same cohort is with Donald Trump—dismissing the Russia allegations, doing nothing to support the people who are trying to get answers, and I find this kind of relative, this relativity about well, you know, if my guy doesn’t think it’s important or if my guy might even be threatened by it, then I don’t care either. That is not patriotism. That is something else entirely.”

0000924,Sports Stars Who Committed The Worst Crimes,"Some athletes think that they rule the world and can get away with anything just because they’re famous.
We treat and pay them like celebrities. Sometimes, they start to feel as if they’re invincible. But for some crimes, money can’t buy their freedom.
Here are the worst crimes ever committed by an athlete:
Rae Carruth is a former wide receiver of the Carolina Panthers. In 2001, he was convicted of conspiring to murder a pregnant woman who was carrying his child. Cherica Adams was 8 months pregnant with Carruth’s child and was shot 4 times in the stomach near his home.
Adams wasn’t dead and was able to call the police and explained that Carruth had drove in front of her to stop her while another man shot her. She fell into a coma at the hospital and died less than a month later.
Carruth fled and was eventually caught hiding in a trunk of a car with $3,900, a cell phone, candy bars and bottles of his own urine.
If you’ve been living under a rock for the last decade, Michael Vick was arrested for running a interstate dog fighting ring in his home. While the police were investigating possible drug charges against Vick’s cousin, they discovered everything in his backyard.
Vick hosted fights at his Virginia home for 6 years before being caught. He bred over 50 dogs and has admitted to shooting, hanging, drowning and electrocuting dogs that didn’t perform well.
The news quickly spread and there was a lot of public outrage, especially from animal rights activists, and soon the feds stepped in and slapped Vick and 3 others with felony charges. Vick was sentenced to 23 months in prison for financing the interstate operation and admitting to personally participating in the fights as well.
Aaron was convicted of the murder of Odin Lloyd, the boyfriend of his fiance’s sister. Lloyd was shot and his body was found only a mile away from Aaron’s house.
It was believed that Aaron’s motive for killing Lloyd was that he knew too much information about a drive-by murder that Hernandez was involved with in Boston back in 2012. The drive-by shooting allegedly started over a spilled drink at a club. Hernandez is still awaiting trial for that incident.
Again, the murder of two people could have all been started over a SPILLED DRINK.
Prosecution had a plethora of evidence pinning Hernandez to Lloyd’s murder, including witnesses, cell phone records and home surveillance video.
He was ultimately sentenced to life in prison without parole and in April of 2017, he was found dead in his cell from an apparent suicide.
Charles Barkley is probably one of the most well-liked basketball analysts ever. He’s won 2 Emmy’s for his sports commentary and the program he co-hosts, Inside The NBA, has won 9 Emmy’s. His wild tangents often not relating to basketball and ability to poke fun at his co-hosts while laughing at himself at the same time all make him a great TV personality.
He displayed his sense of humor when he was caught driving drunk after speeding through a stop sign with a female passenger in his car. When the officer pulled him over and asked him why he was in such a hurry, Barkley’s response was that he had received oral sex from the female passenger the week before and it was the best he’s ever had. He was rushing around the corner to receive the same treatment from said woman. You have to give him some points for honesty, right?
Then, to top it off, when he was taken to the police station, he told an employee that he would let them tattoo his name on their butt if they got him out of the DUI. What he meant to say was that he’d tattoo their name on his butt… Way to go Charles.
Shaun White, the 2-time Olympic gold medalist and undisputed best snowboarder in history, was arrested while staying at a hotel in Nashville, TN.
He was apparently drunk out of his mind and trashed his hotel room. When he was confronted by the hotel staff, he took off and tried getting away in a cab. A guest at the hotel who overheard everything ran after Shaun and told the driver not to move because the police were on their way. Shaun kicked the guest and took off running again.
The guest, not wavering, chased after him and when Shaun stopped suddenly and turned around, the two crashed and Shaun’s head hit the ground hard rendering him motionless. When the cops came, Shaun was so drunk that he couldn’t sign the misdemeanor papers and forced them to arrest him. But before they could bring him to the station, he needed to make a stop at the hospital first.
In the early 90’s, Mike Tyson was on top of the world. He was the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history and was set to fight for his title back against the then champion, Evander Holyfield. But just months before his scheduled bout, he was arrested.
Miss Black Rhode Island, Desiree Washington, who was 18 at the time, accused him of rape. She claimed that Tyson lured her into his hotel room, pinned her down and forced himself on her. She told him no, but he didn’t listen.
Mike Tyson’s defense was that she knew exactly what she was signing up for as Tyson was very upfront on his intentions. Just moments after they first met, Tyson literally told her “I want to f**k you.”
The jury ultimately found him guilty of rape and he was sentenced to 6 years in jail. After serving 3, he was released and was finally able to get his title shot against Evander Holyfield. We all know how that turned out..
You can’t have a worst athlete arrest list without including Plaxico Burress formerly of the NFL’s New York Giants. He famously shot himself in the leg while dancing at a nightclub in New York City. The gun was apparently slipping down his jeans and when he tried to bring it back up, he accidentally shot himself in his right thigh. He turned himself in 2 days later.
The worst part is that he never had a concealed weapon license for New York and the one he had in Florida was expired; making it a felony with a minimum sentence of 3 and a half years in prison.
Plax was suspended for the remaining 4 games of the season and missed the entire playoffs. But that was the least of his worries. The grand jury indicted him on 2 counts of criminal possession of a weapon and 1 count of reckless endangerment, all felonies. He was sentenced to 2 years in prison and did just over 20 months before being released.
Darrell Armstrong played 14 season in the NBA and after retiring, he became the assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks.
While his team was in LA to face the Lakers and then the Clippers in back to back games, he was arrested for an outstanding felony warrant for not paying a debt he owed to a casino in Vegas. Apparently he racked up $37,500 in debt to Harrah’s in Las Vegas by taking credit, then writing a bad check to “pay” for it and never returning.
The crazy part is he was released the next day, after posting $40,000 for bail… Yes, that makes sense.
Lawrence Taylor was charged with statutory rape when he was arrested for sexually abusing a 16 year old girl in Rockland County. She said that she was beaten and forced to go into Taylor’s hotel room by another man and did everything she was ordered to do because she was afraid of what they would do if she didn’t listen.
Apparently Taylor thought she was 19, even though she had a very young looking face, but he did admit to paying her $300 for her services. He pled guilty to sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. Instead of getting jail time, he was only sentenced to 6 years probation, but had to register himself as a sex offender.
The worst thing out of all of this is that apparently sex with minors runs in the family. Lawrence Taylor’s son, Lawrence Taylor Jr., was found guilty of statutory rape and child molestation just this past May. Two 13 year old girls came forward and accused him of sexually abusing them on different occasions. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison, maybe he should’ve joined the NFL first..
Cecil Collins is probably the most talented player you’ve never heard of. That is because halfway through his rookie season with the Miami Dolphins, the running back was arrested and sent to prison for 15 years.
His offense? He broke into a home to watch a woman, who worked out at the same gym as him, sleep. The kicker is that this was the second time he committed this crime.. different woman.. but the same. exact. crime.
But apparently he has been thankful for the sentencing because his life was not heading in the right direction back then and during his time in prison, he met the love of his life. It was a woman who was visiting another inmate in the prison and they somehow fell in love and even married while he was still in his blue jumpsuit.
Jayson Williams was a former Philadelphia 76er and New Jersey Net. After a career ending injury forced him to retire, he took to charity work to give back for all the NBA has given him.
One day, Williams decided to give a tour of his large estate to his NBA charity team while playing with a shotgun. The shotgun accidentally went off and shot and killed the limo driver, Costas Christofi, who drove his charity team to his home.
Williams tried to cover up what had happened even though he had an entire team as witnesses. He was ultimately convicted of 4 counts of trying to cover up the shooting and sentenced to 5 years in prison with the possibility of parole after 18 months.
Adam “Pacman” Jones has one of the longest arrest sheets of any active player in the NFL. He was on probation during the summer that he was drafted in 2005, and was arrested on assault and felony vandalism charges in Nashville that summer. He was arrested three times in 2006 for drugs and alcohol issues.
But his biggest arrest came in 2007, while he was in Las Vegas for the NBA All-Star weekend. He went to a strip club with his friends and was reportedly throwing thousands upon thousands of dollars at the strippers. The two strippers started to fight over the money and chaos erupted. While Jones and his friends were being kicked out by security, one of his friends shot 2 security guards. Both men survived, but one was partially paralyzed. Pacman Jones only received a year probation for his involvement but was forced to pay over $12 million to the paralyzed victim.
The all-time leader in penalty minutes for NHL players, Durbano spent eight years in the league and was known as one of hockey’s toughest players. He had several legal issues following his retirement in 1979.
He was sentenced to seven years in prison in 1983 after he was linked to cocaine importing into Canada. He has been arrested for shoplifting, and was sent back to prison for trying to recruit a police officer in an illegal escorting service.
One of the most talented and successful skaters of the early 1990s, Harding became infamous with her involvement in an attack on fellow American figure skater Nancy Kerrigan.
While she avoided jail time for the 1994 attack in what was an attempt to break her leg and end her career, Harding pleaded guilty to conspiring to hinder prosecution of the attackers who attempted the attack.
She served three years of probation, 500 hours of community service, paid a fine of $160,000, withdrew from her remaining competitions and was banned from skating professionally.
A seven year career running back and 2002 Pro Bowl selection, Henry was eventually suspended in 2008 for being involved in cocaine trafficking operation.
He was the financier behind the ring and faced 10 years to life for his involvement being the operation. He eventually was sentenced to three years in prison and required to pay at least $4 million in fines.
He was also arrested for failing to pay his child support which amounts to roughly $175,000 per year for 11 different children.
A Los Angeles native that stayed local for college and professional football. He was a consensus All-American cornerback for the UCLA Bruins in 1988 and was drafted in the second round by the Los Angeles Rams. He recorded 12 interceptions during his five year NFL career.
He is currently serving a 41-year sentence for trafficking cocaine and in addition, he attempted to murder the judge and witness that were part of the trial by hiring hitmen.
One of the most decorated and feared linebackers to ever play the game, Lewis won two Super Bowls and received 13 Pro Bowl nominations.
Following the Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl victory in 2000, Lewis was involved in an after party altercation between his friends and another group of people.
Two people were subsequently stabbed to death leading to Lewis and two of his friends being arrested for assault and murder charges. Lewis was able to plea the charges down and the others were later acquitted.
Hurd went undrafted out of Northern Illinois that had a fairly successful five year career before his arrest in 2011.
He was arrested during the NFL lockout after being investigated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a possible connection to drug traffickers that were recently arrested.
He was arrested again for failing drug tests and violating his bond. He is currently serving 15 years in a Texas prison.

The news website Tuesday surfaced the existence of a Facebook group called “Being Patriotic,” which the Daily Beast said bears many of the trademarks of other shady Facebook accounts that are believed to have had Russia ties. “Being Patriotic” went dark around the time Facebook deleted accounts linked to a Russian troll farm, according to the Daily Beast. The social media giant would not confirm to the Daily Beast the group’s Russian origins, but it did not challenge the Beast’s suggestions either.
“Being Patriotic” pushed at least four pro-Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton rallies, according to the Daily Beast, including a flash mob that was promoted to occur simultaneously in 17 different Florida locations. In at least a few cases, those events came to fruition, according to the Beast report, and resulted in known Trump activists showing up and promoting the events on their own social media pages.
Facebook’s disclosure of the inauthentic accounts appears to only be the tip of the iceberg of what sort of activity those accounts were involved in, per the Daily Beast:
After The Daily Beast found known Russian accounts that used Facebook’s Events tool to
But the discovery of the “Being Patriotic” rallies suggests that the fraudulent activity on Facebook did indeed involve messaging on behalf of Trump, did prompt at least some Americans to rally on Trump’s behalf, and did result in the Trump campaign volunteers subsequently sharing material from those events.
Russia’s use of Facebook in its alleged campaign to interfere with the 2016 election has come under major scrutiny since the disclosure of the inauthentic accounts. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe has reportedly
The Facebook page the Daily Beast identified Wednesday promoted flash mob events in Florida, a key swing state, in August 2016. Two of the planned locations — Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs — were sites of gatherings by Trump fans, according to photos and videos posted by Dolly Trevino Rump, the Trump campaign’s chairwoman for Broward County. Rump did not respond to the Daily Beast’s inquiries.
Other people who were listed as contacts on Being Patriotic’s events told the Daily Beast they remembered vaguely being contacted by the group to promote the rallies. Betty Triguera, listed as a coordinator on a Sarasota event page, said she heard about the event from Being Patriotic’s Twitter account — which has also been shut down, according to the Daily Beast. Jim Frische, whose name was attached to a Clearwater event page, remembered only vague details of being contacted about the event, and that it ended up being “a dozen or so people out on the street corner.”",unknown,True

“NATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with [U.S. Defense] Secretary [James] Mattis and our allies and international partners,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.
America’s favorite war hawk, John McCain, also praised President Trump’s strategy for Afghanistan. He
“To do this, the President must conduct himself as a wartime commander-in-chief. He must speak regularly to the American people, and to those waging this war on their behalf, about why we are fighting, why the additional sacrifices are worth it, and how we will success.”
On Fox News, Lindsey Graham
“President Trump has the smarts and the moral courage to listen to his generals and take their advice rather than go the political way.”
Despite such fawning praise, the president is now contradicting multiple previous statements he made on the quagmire in Afghanistan. Here are 14 times Donald Trump called for the U.S. to withdraw from the war torn country on Twitter and television:

0000927,Happy Birthday CIA: 7 Truly Terrible Things the Agency Has Done in 70 Years,"(
After spending years as a wartime intelligence agency called the Office of Strategic Services, the agency was solidified as a key player in the federal government’s operations with then-President Harry Truman’s authorization.
In the seventy years since, the CIA has committed a wide variety of misdeeds, crimes, coups, and violence. Here are seven of the worst programs they’ve carried out (that are known to the public):
But the CIA has had a hand in
“The aim [of Operation Paperclip] was to find and preserve German weapons, including biological and chemical agents, but American scientific intelligence officers quickly realized the weapons themselves were not enough.
“They decided the United States needed to bring the Nazi scientists themselves to the U.S. Thus began a mission to recruit top Nazi doctors, physicists and chemists — including Wernher von Braun, who went on to design the rockets that took man to the moon.”
They kept this plot secret, though they
They praised the book’s historical accuracy, noting “that the Launch Operations Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, was headed by Kurt Debus, an ardent Nazi.” They acknowledged that “General Reinhard Gehlen, former head of Nazi intelligence operations against the Soviets, was hired by the US Army and later by the CIA to operate 600 ex-Nazi agents in the Soviet zone of occupied Germany.”
Remarkably, they noted that Jacobsen “understandably questions the morality of the decision to hire Nazi SS scientists,” but praise her for pointing out that it was done to fight Soviets. They also made sure to add that the Soviets hired Nazis, too, apparently justifying their own questionable actions by citing their most loathed enemy.
“In October 1967, a handful of CIA analysts joined in the first big Washington march against the war. The president regarded protesters as enemies of the state. He was convinced that the peace movement was controlled and financed by Moscow and Beijing. He wanted proof. He ordered Richard Helms to produce it.
“Helms reminded the president that the CIA was barred from spying on Americans. He says Johnson told him: ‘I’m quite aware of that. What I want for you is to pursue this matter, and to do what is necessary to track down the foreign communists who are behind this intolerable interference in our domestic affairs…’”
Helms obeyed. Weiner wrote:
“In a blatant violation of his powers under the law, the director of central intelligence became a part-time secret police chief. The CIA undertook a domestic surveillance operation, code-named Chaos. It went on for almost seven years… Eleven CIA officers grew long hair, learned the jargon of the New Left, and went off to infiltrate peace groups in the United States and Europe.”
According to Weiner, “the agency compiled a computer index of 300,000 names of American people and organizations, and extensive files on 7,200 citizens. It began working in secret with police departments all over America.” Because they could not draw a “clear distinction” between the new far left and mainstream opposition to the war, the CIA spied on every major peace organization in the country. President Johnson also wanted them to prove a connection between foreign communists and the black power movement. “The agency tried its best,” Weiner noted, ultimately noting that “the CIA never found a shred of evidence that linked the leaders of the American left or the black-power movement to foreign governments.”
“Dulles kept in close touch with the men who ran the New York Times, The Washington Post, and the nation’s leading weekly magazines. He could pick up the phone and edit a breaking story, make sure an irritating foreign correspondent was yanked from the field, or hire the services of men such as Time’s Berlin bureau chief and Newsweek’s man in Tokyo.”
He continued:
“It was second nature for Dulles to plant stories in the press. American newsrooms were dominated by veterans of the government’s wartime propaganda branch, the Office of War Information…The men who responded to the CIA’s call included Henry Luce and his editors at Time, Life, and Fortune; popular magazines such as Parade, the Saturday Review, and Reader’s Digest; and the most powerful executives at CBS News. Dulles built a public-relations and propaganda machine that came to include more than fifty news organizations, a dozen publishing houses, and personal pledges of support from men such as Axel Springer, West Germany’s most powerful press baron.”
The CIA’s influence had not waned by 1977 when journalist Carl Bernstein
The CIA has also successfully
Researchers Tom Secker and Matthew Alford, whose work has been
“The project, which continued for more than a decade, was originally intended to make sure the United States government kept up with presumed Soviet advances in mind-control technology. It ballooned in scope and its ultimate result, among other things, was illegal drug testing on thousands of Americans.”
Further:
“The intent of the project was to study ‘the use of biological and chemical materials in altering human behavior,’
“Under MKUltra, the CIA gave itself the authority to research how drugs could:’ ‘promote the intoxicating effects of alcohol;’ ‘render the induction of hypnosis easier;’ ‘enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion;’ produce amnesia, shock and confusion; and much more. Many of these questions were investigated using unwitting test subjects, like drug-addicted prisoners, marginalized sex workers and terminal cancer patients– ‘people who could not fight back,’
Further, as Weiner noted:
“Under its auspices, seven prisoners at a federal penitentiary in Kentucky were kept high on LSD for seventy-seven consecutive days. When the CIA slipped the same drug to an army civilian employee, Frank Olson, he leaped out of the window of a New York Hotel.”
Weiner added that senior CIA officers destroyed “almost all of the records” of the programs, but that while the “evidence that remains is fragmentary…it strongly suggests that use of secret prisons for the forcible drug-induced questioning of suspect agents went on throughout the 1950s.”
Years later, the CIA would be accused of distributing crack-cocaine into poor black communities, though this is currently less substantiated and
As Weiner detailed later in his book:
“The Pakistani intelligence chiefs who doled out the CIA’s guns and money favored the Afghan factions who proved themselves most capable in battle. Those factions also happened to be the most committed Islamists. No one dreamed that the holy warriors could ever turn their jihad against the United States.”
Though some speculate the CIA directly armed Osama bin Laden, that is yet to be fully proven or admitted. What is clear is that western media
Weiner noted that as the CIA failed in other countries like Libya, by the late 1980s “Only the mujahideen, the Afghan holy warriors, were drawing blood and scenting victory. The CIA’s Afghan operation was now a $700-million-dollar-a-year-program” and represented 80% of the overseas budget of the clandestine services. “The CIA’s briefing books never answered the question of what would happen when a militant Islamic army defeated the godless invaders of Afghanistan,” though Tom Twetten, “the number two man in the clandestine service in the summer of 1988,” was tasked with figuring out what would happen with the Afghan rebels. “We don’t have any plan,” he concluded.
Apparently failing to learn their lesson, the CIA adopted nearly the exact same policy in Syria decades later, arming what they called “moderate rebels” against the Assad regime. Those groups ultimately

0000928,Why Trump Should Consider a Post-Twitter Presidency,"Almost every supposedly informed prediction about President Donald Trump’s compulsive Twitter addiction has so far proved wrong.
He did not tweet his way out of the Republican nomination. Spontaneous social-media messaging did not lose Trump the general election race with Hillary Clinton. Nor has Trump tweeted his presidency into oblivion.
Instead, Trump’s tweets have not just bypassed the mostly progressive media; they’ve sent it into a tizzy. In near-suicidal fashion, networks such as CNN have melted down in hatred of Trump, goaded on by Trump’s Twitter digs.
Trump has often bragged that having a large following on social media — he has more than 44 million Twitter followers and connects with millions more via Facebook and Instagram — is “like having your own newspaper.”
He has a point.
While the media goes ballistic over Trump’s inflammatory Twitter attacks on “fake news,” the vast majority of Trump’s electronic messaging simply reports on his daily activities and various agendas.
Trump has created a Twitter empire with a reach that far exceeds the combined subscriber base of the New York Times and Washington Post, and he has vastly expanded on Barack Obama’s use of a presidential Twitter feed to connect with voters.
Almost all of the people who have climbed into the Twitter ring with Trump — from Hillary Clinton to the take-a-knee millionaire National Football League players — have come out on the losing end. Trump has proven far better than seasoned journalists and ego-driven celebrities at creating go-for-the-jugular put-downs of 240 characters or less.
Trump’s stream-of-conscious Twitter observations have sometimes proved eerily prescient. He tweeted warnings about the dangers of illegal immigration shortly before the tragic murder of Kate Steinle by an undocumented immigrant with a lengthy criminal record. Soon after Trump retweeted incendiary and controversial videos about radical Islamic violence, earning him condemnation from British prime minister Theresa May, it was announced that two men had been arrested in London for plotting a terrorist attack and assassination — of none other than May herself.
Why, then, should Trump ever consider pruning back his controversial tweets or confining them to the reportage of his daily achievements, in the manner of every other mostly boring politician?
Because personal dueling with journalists, celebrities, and politicians is not only becoming superfluous, but it is now distracting Trump’s audiences from a growing record of achievement.
Nine months ago, critics left and right were writing off Trump as an irrelevant buffoon without a clue of what to do in the White House. They predicted perennial sloth and inaction.
Not now. Trump’s Cabinet and judicial appointments, executive orders, and deregulation measures are systematically overturning the progressive Obama project.
Abroad, the Trump national-security team has recalibrated U.S. foreign policy from an apologetic recessional to engaged, principled realism.
Republican politicians once grumbled about the utopian Paris climate accord but never thought of doing much about it. Trump, like him or hate him, summarily withdrew America from the agreement — and shrugged off the ensuing green outrage.
Members of Congress occasionally expressed support for the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel — but on the expectation that no barnstorming candidate would ever dare to officially recognize Jerusalem as such if elected president.
Prior to 2017, conventional economic wisdom dictated that the Dow Jones industrial average would not soon climb above 22,000, that the unemployment rate in peacetime could not fall to 4 percent, and that the GDP could not grow at an annual rate of 3 percent. All those shibboleths have either been blown up or may yet be blown up in 2018.
Trump is no longer written off by the Left as a sleepy dud. Instead, he suddenly is being redefined by many of his progressive enemies as a dangerous workaholic and right-wing revolutionary.
Never-Trump Republicans no longer insist that Trump is a liberal Manhattan wolf in conservative sheep’s clothing. Grudgingly, they now confess that he is ramming through a conservative agenda not seen since the days of their heartthrob, Ronald Reagan.
In other words, Trump’s record speaks louder than his tweets and now transcends his electronic spats.
So why should Trump still care what a minor journalist tweets about him to get much-needed attention? Why does the president need to keep pounding increasingly irrelevant former FBI director James Comey, who has been reduced to tweeting anti-Trump slogans?
Trump’s record has now transcended his Twitter ankle-biters, who have become ever shriller in seeking attention in the form of electronic counter-put-downs.
In sum, Trump has outgrown the Twitter wars. He should now just declare victory, retire as Twitter champ, hang up his tweeting gloves, and leave the slap-down ring for others.

0000929,"Kennedy, Clinton, and Weinstein: A Convenient Reckoning","Now it’s safe to denounce the worst acts of serial abusers on the left side of the aisle.
In April, the historical drama Chappaquiddick will arrive in theaters. Variety declared the film “a tense, scrupulous, absorbingly precise and authentic piece of history — a tabloid scandal attached to a smoke-filled-room travesty.”
The reviewer, Owen Gleiberman, suggested that the film could spur a dramatic reevaluation of the Liberal Lion of the Senate:
Ted Kennedy should, by all rights, have stood trial for involuntary manslaughter, which would likely have ended his political career. The fact that the Kennedy family — the original postwar dynasty of the one percent — possessed, and exerted, the influence to squash the case is the essence of what Chappaquiddick means. The Kennedys lived outside the law . . . those are the facts, and they are facts that liberals, too often, have been willing to shove under the carpet.
If you’re a Kennedy critic, or just fume at a famous senator enjoying the sort of legal unaccountability usually reserved for Heisman Trophy–winning USC running backs, this film will constitute a form of justice, correcting the record and tearing down the mythical façade. But it’s a rather convenient one for Ted Kennedy, as he died in 2009. Considering the ongoing reverence for the Kennedy family in so many powerful circles in this country, Chappaquiddick is a brave film. But it would have been much braver — perhaps impossible to make — a decade ago.
If the spring brings a reevaluation of Ted Kennedy, it will probably come on the heels of a sudden and dramatic reevaluation of Bill Clinton as a consequence of the explosion of sexual-harassment and assault allegations in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. New York Times opinion columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote Tuesday:
Of the Clinton accusers, the one who haunts me is [Juanita] Broaddrick. The story she tells about Clinton recalls those we’ve heard about Weinstein. She claimed they had plans to meet in a hotel coffee shop, but at the last minute he asked to come up to her hotel room instead, where he raped her. Five witnesses said she confided in them about the assault right after it happened. It’s true that she denied the rape in an affidavit to Paula Jones’s lawyers, before changing her story when talking to federal investigators. But her explanation, that she didn’t want to go public but couldn’t lie to the F.B.I., makes sense. Put simply, I believe her.
A New York Times columnist declaring in print that she believes the 42nd president of the United States is a rapist ought to make people stop and think. But since we’re seeing a tide of slime from predatory men gradually oozing out of Hollywood studios, television networks, and state capitals, it seems fair to ask whether Clinton’s experience left many powerful and abusive men convinced that they could escape serious consequence.
It seems fair to ask whether Bill Clinton’s experience left many powerful and abusive men convinced that they could escape serious consequence.
Another New York Times columnist, David Brooks, asked a question on Charlie Rose a week ago that should leave Democrats awake at night: “How much did tolerance of Bill Clinton create the environment in which the rest of this was given permission?”
The United States had seen infamous and widely covered allegations of sexual harassment before, most notably in the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas and the forced resignation of Oregon GOP senator Bob Packwood. But in January 1998, the Monica Lewinsky scandal set off a year-long national discussion, one that occasionally noted the mounting pile of accusations of sexual misconduct: Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones. The Clinton machine smeared the women viciously, with James Carville nastily declaring, “Drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park and you never know what you’ll find.”
It’s worth remembering the infamous Clinton-finger-wagging moment, when he addressed a skeptical nation and vehemently denied the nature of his encounters with Lewinsky: “I did not . . . have . . . sexual . . . relations with that woman . . . Miss Lewinsky, and I never told anybody to lie.” He did so because in January 1998, admitting to even a consensual relationship with 22-year-old White House intern would have spurred bipartisan demands for his resignation. There was a time when there was a broad cultural consensus that a man in a powerful position is not supposed to look upon his female subordinates as a potential harem. And if Clinton saw Lewinsky as a sexual plaything in the workplace, it’s plausible he could have been less concerned about consent from other women in earlier years.
A few days ago, Matt Yglesias of Vox articulated what was heresy on the Left during those years: “I wonder how much healthier a place we’d be in as a society today if Bill Clinton had resigned in shame back in 1998.”
(One of the great ironies is that if Clinton had resigned and Al Gore had become president, Gore probably would’ve had a greater advantage in the 2000 election. Gore reportedly confronted Clinton forcefully after the 2000 recount and blamed Clinton for his defeat.)
Was Bill Clinton a role model for how men can indulge their worst impulses and get away with it? Since the 1990s, how many men in powerful positions have seen Bill Clinton in that light? After all, all sorts of powerful people — from prominent feminists to powerful lawyers to the leaders of Clinton’s party — came to the consensus that the whole Lewinsky mess was a “private matter.” Perhaps the affair with her was — although Americans are right to expect better from a president — but the claims of Jones, Willey, and Broaddrick were not private matters in the slightest.
After the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, Lee Smith, writing in The Weekly Standard, asked a difficult question that few Democrats will really want to confront. Would the enormously consequential New York Times article detailing the accusations about the Hollywood producer have been published if the 2016 election had ended differently and Weinstein had the president of the United States on speed-dial?
The court over which Bill Clinton once presided, a court in which Weinstein was one part jester, one part exchequer, and one part executioner, no longer exists. . . . If the story was published during the course of a Hillary Clinton presidency, it wouldn’t have really been about Harvey Weinstein. Harvey would have been seen as a proxy for the president’s husband and it would have embarrassed the president, the first female president.
We’ll never know how events would have played out in that alternative reality. Considering Weinstein’s far-reaching and ferocious efforts to discourage reporting about his abuses, it’s easy to believe that he would seek out assistance from the Clintons as the Times reporters closed in.
Right now, we are indeed having a reckoning about a longtime blind eye to powerful men abusing women, but it’s occurring on the most convenient terms for the Democratic party — when Kennedy is dead, Bill Clinton is retired and fading into memory, Hillary’s prospects are done, and her closest network of supporters now largely live on the ash heap of American political history. Funny how all of this worked out so conveniently for the party.

In a series of tweets on Monday, Pence said: “As long as @RealDonaldTrump is POTUS and I am VP, the United States of America will not repeat the shameful mistake of our past when others stood by and ignored the heroic resistance of the Iranian people as they fought against their brutal regime.”
“The bold and growing resistance of the Iranian people today gives hope and faith to all who struggle for freedom and against tyranny. We must not and we will not let them down,” he added.
As long as
(2/2)...The bold and growing resistance of the Iranian people today gives hope and faith to all who struggle for freedom and against tyranny. We must not and we will not let them down.
The vice president’s comments echo those of the Trump administration’s, whose vocal support for the demonstrators takes a different tack to that used by former President Barack Obama and has been slammed by Tehran.
Tweeting about the events in Iran that began last Thursday, the president wrote: “Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years.”
“They are hungry for food &amp; for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!” he added.
The protests that have spread across Iranian cities over the past four days are the largest since 2009, when the country’s disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to mass protests known as the Green Movement.
Thousands of people were arrested during the ongoing demonstrations in 2009, and official Iranian figures state more than 30 people were killed in the clashes. Unconfirmed reports from opposition supporters suggest the death toll was more than twice the number than that of the officially recognized figure.
At the time, then-U.S. President Obama took a cautious approach to the demonstrations in Iran, warning that the administration should not be seen as “meddling” in Iranian affairs.
“It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran’s leaders will be,”
Although Obama warned against violence toward protesters, and several days after the protests broke out condemned the shooting of one demonstrator, his initial reaction was perceived by some to be slow off the mark. Others argued that by failing to back the protests, Obama avoided giving Tehran an excuse to claim they were orchestrated by the U.S.
The recent demonstrations have seen at least 10 people killed in violent clashes that have reportedly seen riot police open fire on demonstrators.
Hundreds of people are believed to have been arrested, while access to social media appears to have been restricted by the government. Iranian citizens have been warned they will “face the nation’s iron fist” if demonstrations continue.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Saturday also accused the U.S. of being “opportunistic” in its support for demonstrators, stating: “The great Iranian nation regards the opportunist and duplicitous support of the American officials for certain gatherings over the recent days in some Iranian cities as nothing but [part of] the deceit and hypocrisy of the U.S. administration.”
“The Iranian people attach no value to the opportunistic remarks by American officials and [President Donald] Trump himself,” he added, according to the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency, calling U.S. statements “cheap, worthless and invalid.”",unknown,True
0000931,Gun Stories of the Week,"'Social Security gun grab’ to be ditched in CRA review of 'midnight regs’
Congress this week will review and potentially repeal some of the “midnight” regulations installed during the last 60 days of the Obama Administration under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Among them: The Social Security Administration rule labeling some Supplemental Security Income and Disability (SSI) recipients as “mental defectives” and reporting them to the FBI’s gun ban database.
Under the rule, possession of firearms by these “mentally defective” individuals — as many as 75,000 law-abiding citizens, including veterans — could be prosecuted as a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
There’s bipartisan support for removing the rule which, even the SSA has acknowledged, may be an example of regulatory over-reach exceeding intent. The poorly written rule could potentially affect anyone who receives benefits and has a representative payee who helps them manage their SSA funds.
More than 91,000 comments were submitted on the rule, the overwhelming majority of them in opposition to it.
NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox, in a Jan 26 press release, praised Congress’s intent to review the rule under the CRA. “Congress’ decision to review the Obama administration’s back-door gun grab is a significant step forward in protecting a fundamental constitutional right for law-abiding gun owners,” he said.
Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.) said reviewing these types of “midnight” regulations” is the reason why the CRA makes sense.
“This issue really can be boiled down to one point: No American should be denied their constitutional rights because someone else handles their finances,” Abraham told The Daily Signal in a statement. “Allowing bureaucrats at the Social Security Administration to determine whether or not beneficiaries are fit to exercise their Second Amendment rights is a clear violation of due process, and I’m pleased the Congressional Review Act will give us the opportunity to right this wrong with passage of this joint resolution.”

Trump to name Supreme Court nominee to succeed Scalia on Feb. 2
In August, Donald Trump’s campaign released a list of 21 judges from which he would select his nominee to succeed the late Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court if he won November’s Presidential election. In mid-January, President Trump announced that he would submit the name of that nominee to the Senate on Thursday, Feb. 2.
According to numerous sources, the ultimate nominee will be one of three finalists gleaned from that list of 21 judges. They are: 11th Circuit Judge William Pryor, 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch and 3rd Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman.
All three were appointed to the federal appellate bench by President George W. Bush, are described as Constitutional “originalists” — as Scalia was — and have met with Trump.
On Jan. 26, Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that he has “made my decision pretty much in my mind"" about which one of the three finalist he will select, but did not want tip his hand until Thursday. ""That's subject to change at the last moment,” he added, “but I think this will be a great choice.”
That same evening, Fox News’ Bill Mears, citing unnamed Trump administration sources, wrote that the short-list had been whittled down to two names — Gorsuch and Hardiman.
Here are brief summaries of the final three, even if there are only two finalists:
— Hardiman, 51, a University of Notre Dame graduate who received law degree from Georgetown University, he drove a taxi to pay for his college tuition and may benefit from an endorsement by Trump’s sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who sits on the 3rd Circuit Court in Philadelphia with him.
Of the three, Hardiman has the most extensive record of pro-gun rights rulings. According to SCOTUS Blog, he dissented in a court ruling upholding a New Jersey law mandating potential gun owners show ""justifiable need"" to carry a handgun in public, backed a decision that said non-violent felons enjoy the Second Amendment right carry a weapon, and has written that the constitutional right ""to keep and bear arms"" extends beyond the home for self-protection.
— Gorsuch, 49, graduated from Columbia University and studied law at Harvard and has a Doctorate of Legal Philosophy from Oxford University. He is the only Ivy League-educated lawyer among the final three.
Gorsuch, whose late mother was President Ronald Reagan's EPA administrator, is notable for his ""Scalia-ness,” with some legal scholars calling him as “the most natural replacement for late Justice Antonin Scalia,” according to SCOTUS Blog.
— Pryor, 54, graduated from Northeast Louisiana University and received his law degree from Tulane University. Like Trump’s U.S. Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, he is a former Alabama State Attorney General.
Of the three, Pryor has been the most outspoken proponent of conservative issues. While Alabama AG, he wrote a brief defending Texas’s anti-sodomy law that was later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court and he has called the Roe v. Wade ruling the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.”

$10 ‘Mandatory Orwellian Device’ could thwart California ‘assault weapon’ law
A California man has invented a simple part he hopes to sell for $10 that thwarts draconian (and blatantly unconstitutional) new “assault weapons” law.
New gun laws in California have gun enthusiasts and companies looking for ways to make guns, like an AR-15, compliant with the law while still retaining a relatively quick and simple way to remove a magazine.
A California law that went into effect Jan. 1 and defines “assault weapons” as any semi-automatic center fire rifle, such as an AR-15, that does not have a fixed magazine and features such as a flash suppresser and pistol grip.
But inventor John Bastiani of Bastiani Arms says his firm has developed a product that can modify an AR so it is California compliant, while still allowing it to be disassembled quickly to take out the magazine, for $10.
“Things that are on the market now cost upwards of $50, per gun to convert and make them legal,” he told Bob Owens of Bearingarms.com. “There needs to be a cheap solution. There might be people out there with 10 guns that they need to convert and at $50 per gun that’s cost prohibitive.”
Bastiani and friend Mike Schroeder researched and designed parts that they could patent. Ultimately, like most good ideas, the solution was relatively simple: They replaced the bolt catch on the left side of the gun.
“I cut some stainless steel… traced around, laid it out, cut it out with a dremel and a file, put it in the gun and said, ‘Oh my god, it actually does what I thought it would!’,” he told Owens. “We kind of lucked out because no one was thinking of the side of the gun we developed our lock for.”
Bastiani said the part — which he has named MOD1 for “Mandatory Orwellian Device” — should only cost around $10 and would fit on any AR.
“This is something that is legally necessary if you don’t desire to register your weapon as an assault weapon,” he told Owens. “It requires no skill at all to install.”
Too bad uninstalling California’s “assault weapon” laws wasn’t equally as simple.

Montana AG upholds state preemption in nixing Missoula gun ordinance
Montana Attorney General Tim Fox on Jan. 27 ruled that a city of Missoula’s ordinance requiring background checks for private gun sales violates the state’s preemption law and, therefore, is unconstitutional.
According to Fox’s determination, local governments in Montana are limited to regulating where gun owners can concealed carry, not how they can purchase firearms.
“Plainly interpreted, the Montana Legislature has prohibited all forms of local government from exercising any regulatory power over the purchase, sale or transfer of firearms,” Fox wrote in his ruling.
The Missoula City Council adopted the ordinance in September after Missoula’s City Attorney Jim Nugent assured them that such regulation was within the city’s jurisdiction.
Shortly after, Fox said that in his view, the ordinance exceeded the jurisdiction of local government as defined in the state’s Constitution and as stipulated by the State Legislature.

Sorry.
Here, read the headline and discuss amongst yourselves for a moment while we compose ourselves.
Perspective: Conservatives are the real campus thought police squashing academic freedom
— Washington Post (@washingtonpost)
DUDE.
From the Washington Post:
Last week, I sent a string of relatively uncontroversial tweets in the aftermath of the Las Vegas massacre, in which I sought to answer a question about mass shootings in the United States: Why are these crimes almost always carried out by white men? “It’s the white supremacist patriarchy, stupid,” I tweeted, before then diagnosing a sense of double entitlement — as white people and as men — that, when frustrated, can occasionally lead to violent consequences.
My argument was not new, but rather reflects decades of research on how race and gender function in our society. To be both white and male is to be subject to a potent cocktail of entitlement to economic and political power, and to dominate nonwhite and female bodies. When that entitlement is frustrated, it can lead to what the criminologist Mike King calls “aggrieved whiteness,” an ambient furor based on the idea that white Americans have become oppressed victims of politically correct multiculturalism.
Seems the writer is upset because others were not pleased with him blaming the Las Vegas shooting on skin color.
What did he expect?

The same can be said of the media’s treatment of Israel’s 1967 attack on the USS Liberty, which killed 34 American sailors and injured 174 more. A search of the New York Times archive reveals only two brief entries for the topic “USS Liberty.”
A June 14, 1967 report of an LBJ press conference [six days after the attack] includes the following Q &amp; A:
“Do you have any more facts you can release on the attack on the USS Liberty? A. “No, I think you know about as much about it as we do.”
Another article on June 5, 1982 refers to the attack and Israel’s apology, adding only that some survivors refuse to accept the official explanation of “mistake.”
What could have inspired the virtual press boycott of such a major story involving American casualties?
Believing that the 50th anniversary of the attack deserved appropriate remembrance, I emailed the following letter to editors of the New York Times, Washington Post and Guardian, US on June 5-6:
“To the Editor,
June 8th marks the 50th anniversary of the brazen and deliberate attack by Israel on the USS Liberty, a lightly armed intelligence-gathering ship in international waters off the coast of Egypt.
On that afternoon during the Six Day War in 1967 waves of Israeli jets attacked the Liberty without warning. A subsequent barrage from three torpedo boats nearly sank the ship, while the two attacks killed 34 American sailors and injured 174 others.
According to Paul Craig Roberts of the Institute for Political Economy, who interviewed survivors and government officials, President Lyndon B. Johnson not only aborted an American rescue mission, but also ordered a cover-up of the whole affair. He reportedly said he “wasn’t going to embarrass an ally.”
Notwithstanding the damning conclusions of the Moorer Commission in 2003, no subsequent US administration has dared break an apparent vow of silence.
It’s time to honor both Liberty’s victims and remaining survivors. It’s time to tell the American people what happened on that day and why.”
None of those leading US journals included my letter above in their pages. In a June 27 email to Times Middle East correspondent Ben Hubbard, I noted that the 50th anniversary of the Israeli attacks on the USS Liberty had passed without recognition and “wondered why there was then and continuing to now no coverage by the major media.” I never received a response.
Just as the Hammond piece broke the web of silence around the downing of the Iranian airliner, the regional Cape Cod Times newspaper fearlessly published my letter quoted above. A few days later the CCT included my second letter inviting readers who still regard the attack as an innocent mistake to view the online videos and survivor interviews.
However, the purpose of this article is not to recount details of the attack or the differing interpretations it has generated. Interested readers can find examples of both in the more than a dozen books on the subject available on Amazon and in survivor-narrated videos available on the Internet.
Rather, our purpose is to ask why the mainstream media continues to participate in a continuing official cover-up.
While the New York Times and other American newspapers slept through the Liberty’s 50th anniversary and survivor events, the Israeli journal Haaretz on July11 cited a CIA document, still partly censored, that relates a conversation between an Israeli pilot and the Israeli Defense Force war room prior to the attack. The material language appears in article’s title: “‘
The above cited FPJ article observes that “the lack of mention of the [Iranian shootdown] …illustrates an institutionalized bias in the media.” By failing to report on the Liberty affair and subsequent investigations, the New York Times and other mainstream journals have committed a similar sin of omission.",unknown,True
0000938,"Five Years After Losing Son, Radio Host Delilah Shattered Again after Losing Another Child","Anyone who listens to syndicated radio is probably familiar with at least the voice of Delilah. With an estimated 8 million listeners, this long-time radio host gives encouragement to listeners who call her with their requests.
Delilah tells people, “I love sharing my life with you as much as I love hearing about yours.” Many times she will listen to someone’s story and then choose the song she feels best speaks to their situation.
What we all too often fail to realize though, is Delilah, and others who publically help people with their problems such as Dr. Phil, have lives of their own. They face the same day-to-day realities the rest of us do.
Delilah is the mother of 13 children. Her huge brood of kids is relatively unknown to her fans.
TRENDING:
Now, instead of Delilah soothing the emotions of a distraught caller, she is in need of the same type of comfort she regularly doles out. Life has dealt her a bad hand.
One of her children, Zachariah,
There are over 1 million recorded suicides per year, but when they hit as close to home as Delilah’s son, just one of them is enough to destroy the emotional well-being of the people left behind to mourn their loss. Questions go unanswered, and though often unwarranted, feelings of guilt relentlessly invade their psyche.
Delilah said her heart is broken beyond repair and she cannot fathom how to go on. She also believes her son is at peace and is resting with the Lord.
Ten of Delilah’s 13 children are adopted. She lost another child, Sammy, in 2012 from sickle cell anemia.
If you are a fan of Delilah’s and have called her show concerning whatever was on your mind at the time, please remember there are sometimes people who are going through worse things than you are. This is a classic example.
Delilah will be taking an “indefinite break from radio.” She will also be absent “on social media for a time as [she grieves and tries] to process this loss with [her] family.”
Just as many people are experiencing, or have experienced, an insurmountable tragedy in their life, being famous does not exempt radio, television, or movie personalities from what life is going to do. Good, or bad.
However, the strength Delilah is showing in the face of despair should be an example for all of us to follow. While this is one of the most difficult challenges she has ever had to face, life for Delilah goes on.

Conservative firebrand and Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren is getting ridiculed on Twitter after she implied NFL athletes don’t know why they are kneeling during the national anthem.
Lahren appeared on the network Tuesday night, and she had some thoughts about professional athletes who continue to kneel:
“This is a serious question I have for these players that are, in fact, kneeling, because there are so many at this point. What exactly are you kneeling for, and why, exactly, have you chosen the flag and the anthem to do it? I bet if we asked 100 players, we’d get 100 different answers,” she explained. “And I would like to ask those same players, What would it take for you to then stand and respect the flag and the anthem,’ and again, you’d probably get 100 different answers.”
Ever since Colin Kaepernick took his first knee during the anthem, he and his fellow kneelers have repeatedly said that they are protesting police brutality and racial injustice.

— Fox News (@FoxNews)
Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, created a vivid, cutthroat description of President Donald Trump’s new
The new policy, which kills federal payouts to insurers, was dubbed by Murphy as “health care arson” during an appearance on Fox News Sunday today. The junior Democrat senator serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and has been one of the loudest voices in advocating against the GOP’s attempts at Obamacare repeal.
Murhpy’s full comment went as follows:
“[Trump] is literally setting the entire health care system on fire — just because the president is upset that the United States Congress won’t pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public… The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the american health care system, trying to has put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill that the American public doesn’t want us to repeal.”
The “sabotage” that Murphy mentioned is a reference to Trump cutting an Obamacare subsidy program that aimed to cut out-of-pocket charges for low-income and working class Americans. With help and advice from Senator Rand Paul, Trump made the decision to cut these subsidy payments in an attempt to allow small businesses access to the same kind of coverage as large group plans.
However, critics — like Murphy — argue that Trump’s executive order will actually hurt the Americans that it’s designed to help,

0000945,The Destruction of The United States of America Is Almost Complete!,"Ladies and gentlemen, hold your families close, because if we even make it to Christmas, it’s bound to be our last.
The Republican Party is systematically tearing down the country brick by brick and this week could finally be the one that breaks the country completely.
It is bad enough that the Republicans tried to take away healthcare from millions of people by not forcing them to buy it. Thank God they failed there, but they apparently didn’t think that was enough.
They took away net neutrality, which was enforced to solve a problem that didn’t exist, and decided to give it back to the free market rather than keep it under the control of the executive branch, where it could safely be in Donald Trump’s capable, though very tiny hands.
That should have been enough, but they were out for more blood. Despite the fact that the Republicans were warned that ending net neutrality would kill millions, enslave the LGBT community, and do untold damage to the remaining minority communities, they ended it and they still sought more.
This brings us to the tax reform package.
It looks like there will be a vote on Tuesday to get the conference committee’s bill through the legislative branch and quickly bring it to Trump’s desk. This bill, if passed, is set to do incredible damage to the American way of life.
For starters, thanks to heartless robot Marco Rubio, people will be able to receive bigger tax credits for having more kids. Do you know what that means? It’s a bigger incentive to have more children. In a world that Republicans are apparently trying to destroy, it is morally reprehensible to willingly bring children into it just to save a bit on your tax note.
What’s worse, however, is that there are cuts to business tax bills, meaning that some major companies could move back to American soil, and bring their big corporate dollars with them. More business here means more opportunities for major corporations to pollute our earth and create jobs for Americans. That means more people going to work, and their cars will only exacerbate the pollution problem.
On top of all that, this bill repeals the individual mandate, so millions of people will die by not being forced to buy insurance, just like the GOP really intended all along.

0000946,Steve Bannon’s Tactical Retreat,"“Soon…”
Once a man on top of the world, Steve Bannon is now fighting for his life.
He was President Donald Trump’s closest advisor, as well as the driving force behind the biggest and most pro-Trump outlet that isn’t Fox News. He was also a self-styled kingmaker, looking to push candidates who would fulfill the same agenda Trump’s presidency was supposed to aim for.
However, Bannon lost the job of advisor. His outlet’s influence does not appear to be reaching as far as it used to. His candidates fail. It’s difficult to tell who fell out of love with who first, but Bannon and the White House do not appear to be in love anymore.
I won’t re-hash all of the details, but the latest drama seems to stem from writer Michael Wolff’s unfettered access to the White House and its staff as he wrote a book on the tumultuous presidency. Some of the key quotes from the book indicate that Trump was aware of the Russian meetings. Others show Bannon insulting Ivanka’s intelligence.
If Bannon was hoping to lay low after the complete debacle that was the Roy Moore candidacy, it looks like he’s out of luck. This story is going to get a lot of airtime, and why wouldn’t it? Trump’s closest advisor from the early days basically admitted there was something to this Russia story that keeps plaguing the administration. What will stop any media outlet from talking about that, as well as having panels talking about that.
Bannon is not a complete dummy. His actions from the moment of Andrew Breitbart’s death were calculated to make Bannon into a political playmaker – someone who could change the face of Washington. It wasn’t an ideological urge, either. Every action he’s taken indicates he just wants to be remembered as the guy who orchestrated the cleaning of the swamp.
It’s all blowing up in his face, however, so he’s having to sound a tactical retreat. The statements against the Trump family are designed to help him wash his hands of the Trump Administration should there be something to these Russia allegations. Looking at his website, it appears he is easing off that plan, and will instead focus on the good of the Trump Administration.
Because, even if you were fired from the White House, you still want your contacts and pushers in D.C. helping you out.
However, he is not fighting from a position of strength anymore. Bannon has been forced to go defensive now, and you can tell from the editorial direction at his site currently that they don’t want to fight Trump right now. There is a simple reason for that, too: They built this monster, and they know the monster will turn and consume them if they don’t watch out.

0000947,Andrew McCabe’s Retirement Is a Chance for the FBI to Regain Its Reputation and Integrity,"Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe will take early retirement from the FBI in March, according to a report in the Washington Post.
This is long overdue. It was obvious long before Christopher Wray was confirmed that McCabe was part of the problem and not part of the solution. McCabe is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice IG for his blatant violation of the Hatch Act. When his wife was running for a state senate seat in Virginia,
And, of course, as deputy director, McCabe was up to his eyebrows in the Trump dossier. As the guy running the day-to-day business of the FBI, it is impossible that the proposal to pay retired British spy Christopher Steele some $50,000 to continue his investigation escaped his notice.
Since the firing of Peter Strzok, we’ve learned that McCabe and Strzok, on at least one occasion, spoke at some length about the presidential race, and, given the tenor of the text messages, we can presume they all talked about the necessity of Hillary Clinton winning. What makes this conversation so damning is that McCabe cleared Strzok to work on Mueller’s Russia probe.
As I noted earlier today,
While there was no fire, per se, there was enough smoke and stench that it was clear that McCabe was not going to survive in the long run. McCabe’s actions, and those of a lot of other senior FBI staff, left the casual observer the option of believing he was stupid or that he just didn’t care about rules and thought he was bulletproof…or that the Deep State is real and had been accidentally revealed.
Before his testimony this past Tuesday,
GOWDY: I’m still trying to figure out why three FBI agents are discussing politics in the deputy director’s office. Because you’re not supposed to discuss politics on federal ground and FBI agents aren’t supposed to engage in politics for Hatch Act reasons. Remember, we were supposed to interview Andy McCabe yesterday on another committee. It was all set up and ready to go, then, at the last minute, they said he can’t come Tuesday, he’s going to come next week. I’ll be shocked if he comes next week. I’ll be a little bit surprised if he’s still an employee of the FBI this time next week.
According to the
Andrew McCabe, the FBI’s deputy director who has been the target of Republican critics for more than a year, plans to retire in a few months when he becomes fully eligible for pension benefits, according to people familiar with the matter.
McCabe turns 50 on May 5 and this, under the peculiarities of the federal retirement system for FBI agents, allows him to retire at full benefits (1.7% of the average of his high-three pay years, times 20). I’m assuming in March that he’ll sign out on leave and not come back.
Of course, the anti-Trumpers who were crying in their beer over James Baker’s demotion are putting a brave face on it
A word of caution on the Andrew McCabe story. I have always assumed that McCabe would retire in March to let Wray build his own team. So I would not see this as part of any purge. The question about McCabe was always whether he would be forced out early.
— Benjamin Wittes (@benjaminwittes)
McCabe’s ouster is a very good thing. The FBI had become highly politicized under Comey. Political loyalties drove major investigations, not the law or the evidence. Wray inherited an executive staff that was not only loyal to Comey but was hostile to the current administration. Pushing the general counsel aside and forcing the retirement of McCabe is a great chance for Wray to build his own team. A professional and non-partisan team. For a change.",unknown,False

The fan also revealed that she was selling the goods not because she stopped stanning the singer, but because she needed money to study music herself.
Kim Chungha, who had been listening hidden behind a tree, let out a sigh of relief.
The staff then showed the fan the autographed polaroid of the artist they had prepared earlier. The fan immediately realized that the autograph was fake, questioning, “Isn’t this different from how she usually signs her autographs?”
Kim Chungha then showed up right next to the fan, completely shocking her. The fan couldn’t hide her excitement and hugged her favorite artist repeatedly. The fan once again confirmed that she was still a huge fan of Kim Chungha and said she had even appeared on her radio show.

Umm Jihad clicked on a folder labeled “Jojo” to show more pictures: Jihad leading a protest for government reform at Amman’s al-Dakhiliya circle; Jihad giving a speech at the University of Jordan; Jihad dressed in white for a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia; Jihad taking a selfie with his younger brother; Jihad with a full beard, holding a gun, wading through a stream, and waving a black flag inscribed with Jabhat al-Nusra’s white letters: “There is no God but God. Muhammad is the prophet of God.”
The last file in her folder is an amateur diptych, two photos of Jihad in the same pose: sprawled on the floor, chest forward, arms outstretched. On the right, he’s asleep at home on a pile of books and papers, exhausted from studying for tawjihi, the Jordanian college-entrance exam. On the left, blood is pooling from the bullet holes in his bare back. He’s 20 years old, a foreign fighter in Syria, dead.
Jihad Ghaban was one of at least 2,000 Jordanians who have joined factions in the Syrian civil war since it began in 2011, according to
Still, Jordan’s more acute fight is internal. Its stability is evidence of its strong security, as tightened borders and surveillance prevent Jordanians from joining or forming domestic cells of groups like the Islamic State. And ISIS’s filmed killing of the captured Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, broadcast in February, helped
Umm Jihad’s son left Jordan to fight back in 2013, before the rise of ISIS and subsequent strife between militant jihadist groups in Syria. But the lack of democratic reform after the Arab Spring, along with the spread of religious extremism amid regional instability, continue to undermine many Jordanians’ belief in the country’s political leaders and religious institutions. Interpretation of Islam, and particularly the concept of jihad, is in flux, leaving an exegetical gray zone for passionate, disempowered youth like Jihad Ghaban.
Mo’men Jaabo was 23 when he first met Jihad as a 16-year-old in 2011, the first year of the Arab Spring. Jaabo, who was a schoolteacher at the time, marched next to Jihad through downtown Amman, shouting slogans about freedom and political reform. They used to protest at al-Dakhiliya circle in the daytime, then spend nights writing graffiti in the East Amman neighborhood of Hay Nazzal, where Jihad lived. The neighborhood is poor, conservative, and mostly Palestinian, with a growing Syrian population including older people who fled the Assad government’s
A few streets away, Jaabo pointed out a large mosque overlooking Hay Nazzal’s main traffic circle. “That’s where Jihad prayed,” Jaabo said, adding that the mosque was well known for Salafi preaching that called for a fundamentalist return to Islam as practiced by the first generations of Muslims. Preachers there interpreted jihad as literal warfare in defense of the Muslim community.
Jihad was an early participant in
Four years later, the Jordanian government’s promised reform initiatives have largely
“When things went down after the first year in Syria, then Libya, we lost hope. It felt like our effort was nonsense,” Jaabo said. “In Jordan, we felt everyone was laughing at the youth. The government and parties were all laughing. Nobody was serious about making reform.”
Jaabo is now 26 and works as the manager of a falafel restaurant. Other Herak members, many from more privileged backgrounds in West Amman, left to study abroad or work in Gulf countries, he said. But Jihad was still a teenager, the son of a factory worker, and struggling to afford his first year of college tuition. Aside from studying, Jihad worked in Jordan’s Sharawi chewing-gum factory. He’d get off work and cross Amman on foot to attend Herak protests, walking for hours because he couldn’t afford taxi fares. His friends nicknamed him Abu Sharawi for the gum he’d pass around every time he arrived.
When Bashar al-Assad’s regime cracked down on Syrian protesters, Umm Jihad said, Jihad spent hours watching Al Jazeera and crying. In the middle of winter, Jaabo said, he and Jihad walked to the Syrian embassy to protest in the snow, waving Free Syria flags to demonstrate Jordanian solidarity against Assad.
As the situation in Syria worsened and Jordan’s activists lost traction, Jihad started thinking about joining the fight. He’d ask his friends what they thought was the best way to help Syrians, said Jihad’s 22-year-old friend Laith Alawneh. “He started thinking that our fight in Jordan is not the priority,” Alawneh said. “There is no bloodshed here, but people in Syria were being killed.” In June 2013, Jihad went on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia with a group of young people from his local mosque. When he came back, Umm Jihad said, Jihad told her he wanted to spend a few days in Cairo with friends before returning to school. Jihad flew from Jordan to Egypt to Turkey. After a few days, he called his mother from the Syrian city of Aleppo and told her he’d joined Jabhat al-Nusra.
At the time, ISIS was a
During his first year in Syria, Jihad worked for Jabhat al-Nusra’s media office. He had once dreamed of being a journalist; he’d interned at a community radio station in Jordan and filmed youth protests during the Arab Spring. Now he filmed Nusra fighters, spread the footage on social media, and peppered Facebook with increasingly extremist posts.
“Jihad changed then,” Jaabo said. “I couldn’t believe the things he started to say.” In Jordan, Jihad had had friends of all stripes: Muslim Brotherhood supporters, communists, even conservatives who weren’t politically active. He’d swung across the political spectrum, considering joining the Brotherhood, then the leftist parties, but rejecting them all in the end. “The parties can’t criticize the [Jordanian] king because they are part of the system. Jihad wasn’t satisfied with this,” Jaabo said. “He’d rather be independent than compromise.”
Jihad was religious before going to Syria, his friends and family said, but not radical. “He loved Islam,” said Alawneh, Jihad’s leftist friend. “But he was also talking to girls and going out. He wasn’t strict at all.”
After Jihad went to Syria, he changed his Facebook profile photo from the Free Syria flag to the Jabhat al-Nusra flag. His purist tendencies took a religious bent, manifesting in his Facebook declarations that communists were kuffar, or infidels, and had to be killed. Did that mean, Jihad’s friends in Jordan wondered, that he would fight them if they were in Syria? Jihad was getting caught in an ideological and religious war, his friends told him, not a freedom fight. “Still he didn’t change his mind,” Jaabo said.
“He’d tell us, ‘You’re not helping people. You’re in the house while people are suffering,’” said Jihad’s Syrian childhood friend Mulham al-Ahdab. He thought Jihad was being abrasive on Facebook, but then again, Syria was burning. At least Jihad was doing something. “I hate this world that stays silent while young guys like Jihad sacrifice themselves,” Ahdab said. “We all still loved him.”
Eventually, Jihad took up arms for Nusra. In October 2014, one year and four months after entering Syria, he was shot by Syrian government forces and killed.
From the Jordanian government’s perspective, combating extremism requires a combination of security policy—guarding the country’s borders to prevent fighters from flowing in or out of the Kingdom—and ideological persuasion. “Our strategy is to secure people’s way of thinking,” said the Ministry of the Interior spokesperson Ziad al-Zoubi. “We must support moderate ideologies before extremist ones become popular.” Jordanian authorities attempt to do so by holding dialogues and workshops with youth via civil-society organizations, Zoubi said, and by promoting moderate Islam through the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, the government entity that manages Islamic property.
Ashraf al-Kilani, the director of the Jordanian civil-society organization Friends of National Security, said his organization recruits religious leaders, often from the state institution Dar al-Ifta, to engage young people in dissecting ISIS material and to point out why the group’s interpretation of Islam is wrong. Sometimes participants are then brought to the King Abdullah Special Operations Training Center (KASOTC), a
“The youth are happy to have real talk with us and to meet with security officials,” Kilani said, adding that many request photos with the KASOTC officers. “We as Jordanians really adore the army, the security forces, and the king.”
On the religious side, Minister of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Hayel Daoud said that there are 6,300 mosques in Jordan delivering some 5,000 Friday sermons every week. The country’s mosques are all overseen by the government, Daoud added, so every message preached on Fridays should adhere to an Awqaf-approved version of moderate Islam. “We want them to talk about mutual topics that everyone agrees on, not anything that causes division,” Daoud said. “We want topics that encourage people to live in unity and peace.” Fifty ministry employees monitor the mosques and report any preachers who stray from approved content. Since the Muath al-Kaseasbeh video in February, Daoud said, the ministry has relieved 50 preachers of their duties.
But critics say the Jordanian government’s attempts to control the religious sphere have had a limited impact, if any at all. “I’ve never met anyone who changed his mind from extremist ideas because of someone from the Awqaf,” said the Amman-based Islamist expert Hassan Abu Hanieh. Official religious institutions lack credibility among the people, he said, because they’re seen as part of the political system. At the University of Jordan, Alawneh laughed at the idea that government monitoring could stop extremist ideas. “Awqaf stopped 50 people who support extremist ideas in the whole country?” he said. “Go walk on our campus for 10 minutes and I’ll find you 50 more.”
Fewer Jordanian youth are going to fight in Syria now than when Jihad went, Alawneh observed, but that’s not necessarily because the government has changed young people’s minds about the merits of jihad. The interpretation of jihad, a duty to literally “struggle” for Islam, is disputed. Some Muslims understand the struggle as spiritual and internal; others speak in terms of social justice, of educational, missionary, intellectual, or economic endeavor; and still others of holy warfare.
“When Jihad died, all these Salafi guys were making speeches at his wake, saying how he was brave and martyred,” Jaabo said. “Nowadays the situation is very different with Daesh [an Arabic term for ISIS], but even so, people believe in the war in Syria. There’s no problem [with most Jordanians] if anyone goes to fight.”
A university memorial service for Jihad was filled with youth who supported Jihad’s decision to go to Syria, according to Alawneh. “They were all praying for God to take revenge on the Shi’a and help the mujahideen,” Alawneh said, referring to Sunni rebel groups fighting the Shiite Assad regime. The reasons young people aren’t crossing the border to fight these days are often not ideological but practical: tightened security, no way of returning to Jordan, and reservations about the chaos and uncertainty in Syria.
“Jihad was brave. We are weak,” said Ahdab, explaining why he didn’t go to Syria as well. “We are creating different excuses for ourselves, but in the end we know that he is a hero and that he did the right thing.”
Alawneh, for his part, believes waging war in Syria isn’t the best way to help the Syrian people. “Syria is a game. You have the Saudis, Turkey, Iran, America, Qatar—why would I let myself be an instrument in the hands of these people?” he said. Young fighters on every side are being manipulated in a cycle of weapons, blood, and money that only advances the political interests of the big powers, Alawneh added. “I wouldn’t join the Jordanian army and become a tool for America either.”
Nasser Abu Abdulrahman, a 48-year-old Salafi sheikh from the conservative Jordanian town of Rusaifeh, said he wouldn’t encourage the younger generation to fight in Syria—not because doing so conflicted with his interpretation of jihad in Islam, but because of the split between jihadist groups there. “This is a time of fitnah [infighting and division among Muslims]. The mujahideen are split,” Abu Abdulrahman said, referring to the schism between ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra that first developed in the summer of 2013. It’s better for Jordanians to stay home for now, Abu Abdulrahman said, rather than exacerbate internal Islamic disunity by joining factions that are battling one another.
Abu Abdulrahman characterized ISIS as an overly zealous group that had made serious mistakes in ideology and action, particularly in burning to death Muath al-Kaseasbeh. “But no one says that Daesh is not Muslim. We don’t call them infidels,” he said. Even if the Islamic State employs illegitimate methods of Quranic exegesis, he added, people will support the Sunni group out of desperation amid war, oppression, and suffering. “If a drunk man protects your son from being raped, you will defend [the drunk man]. He is better than others because he protected your son,” Abu Abdulrahman explained. Likewise, people suffering in Syria and Iraq, especially Sunnis, will overlook ISIS’s theological illegitimacy to support its military success, especially given the seeming lack of international will to end Syria’s war.
According to his friends, Jihad was driven to join Nusra for many of those same reasons: intolerance of injustice, frustration with international inaction, and a determination to make a difference. “Jihad was the Arab Spring personified. He wasn’t a spectator,” said Ahdab.
“Jihad was like a white page that anyone could write on. It was easy to affect him because he was so passionate,” Alawneh noted. He had argued with Jihad about the legitimacy of extremist religious ideology. But bring up the chemical-weapons attacks, dying children, and raped women in Syria, and Jihad would cry.
“Jihad had fire in his chest,” Umm Jihad said. She recalled the time she and Jihad passed a man beating his donkey on the street. Her son stopped and rebuked the man even though Umm Jihad insisted it was none of their business. “If that’s how he cared about donkeys, what about Syria?” she mused. “Jihad was tired from Jordan and the government. He was always talking and no one listened to him. He wanted action, not words.” Jihad went to Syria to die, Umm Jihad said, and she had no choice but to accept it.
On the streets of Amman, bold signs in patriotic red, green, and black declare, “Raise your head, you are Jordanian.” The state’s message is clear: Jordan is one; Jordan is strong; Jordan is proud to stand against the terrorists.
The death of the pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh has made this government message more of a reality, according to a recent
Still, the best way to describe how many Jordanians view Islamic extremist groups is in shades of gray, according to Khatib. “There is an extremely thin line between being a very good Muslim who follows the prophet’s rules and becoming extremist,” he explained. The government may try to convince people that it knows where these lines are, but state-affiliated voices lack legitimacy on the Jordanian street. “The government places its personal interests above religious correctness,” Abu Abdulrahman said.
While Jordanians often trust and depend on the government to preserve national security, they are not so quick to believe its opinions on God’s will. Umm Jihad, for example, doesn’t have faith in official talk about nonviolent jihad. “Look at how barrel bombs are destroying hospitals in Syria. Look at how Muslims are being killed in Burma. Isn’t this injustice?” she asked. “Our religion is clear. If a Muslim needs help, you must go and fight for them.”
At the same time, Umm Jihad hadn’t known Jihad was going to Syria, nor was she able to make him come back. “I want to tell you I believe he made the right decision,” she said. She’d cried and begged her son to return every time he called, despite believing that jihad is a duty and that her son’s motives were pure. “Those without much faith will say, ‘Stay here with me and don’t go.’ She with strong faith will tell her son, ‘You must go and fight,’” Umm Jihad said. “But as a mother, this is difficult. This is right, but difficult.”
The real conversations in Jordan on religion and the nature of jihad are happening not at state-sponsored dialogue sessions, but on the Internet and social media, according to Abu Hanieh, the expert on Islamism. He opened Facebook as an example, scrolling down his news feed through an endless stream of posts: a video message from extremists establishing the “state of Sinai,” a photo of the Islamic State creating roads in the Sinjar Mountains in Iraqi Kurdistan, congratulations for the ISIS victory in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, condemnation of Muslims being burned in Burma, and so on. “If the state wanted to silence the jihadis, they’d have to silence everyone,” Abu Hanieh said.
Abu Hanieh noted that after the release of the Kaseasbeh video, he didn’t see many Jordanians rejecting extremist groups outright; instead, he witnessed Jordanians discussing nuanced questions about the permissibility of burning as a punishment in Islam. “The ideology of extremism has become more flexible,” Abu Hanieh said. “People are thinking about jihad more than before, and the discussions are loud, passionate, and spreading.”
If the Jordanian government can’t fight extremism through ideological control, what can it do? The opposite, Abu Hanieh suggested: democratic reform and political opening. “Jordan is moving away from democracy in the name of combating extremism,” he said, citing state crackdowns on communists, Herak, and the Jordanian wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. “If you let the moderates back into the light, that will push the extremists to the margin.” Jihad’s friends agreed. “We need bread, freedom, and social justice,” Alawneh said.
As a 16-year-old, Jihad had once demanded those exact things. “Jihad cared so much, but he felt like nobody was listening in Jordan,” Jaabo said. “If he had found real reform here, I think he never would have gone.”

Underlying every official statement and every demand for this or that A-Lister to speak out is the question of who knew what—who was truly in the dark, and who was actively covering for an abuser (or simply looking the other way). As actress Emma de Caunes told The New Yorker, “I know that everybody—I mean everybody—in Hollywood knows that it’s happening… He’s not even really hiding. I mean, the way he does it, so many people are involved and see what’s happening. But everyone’s too scared to say anything.”
It’s entirely unfair to hound actresses for Harvey Weinstein statements or blame them for working with a man who was, by all accounts, too powerful to offend or take down.

As revelations about Weinstein’s alleged “nature”—predatory, exploitative, vindictive, small—continue to make headlines, Damon’s days-long silence was seen as evidence of his continued loyalty.

Damon and Affleck’s statements feel disingenuous, and not just because they waited days to issue them, finally speaking out when the pressure to do so (from both the public and their peers) became unbearable. Both of the actors purport to support victims and condemn abusers. Affleck’s statement in particular is focused around the concept of doing more, with the star seemingly challenging himself to work toward dismantling the systems of power that elevate abusers and silence their victims. One wonders where Ben Affleck, male ally, was back in 2016, when he was a major player in his brother Casey Affleck’s Oscar campaign.

Harvey Weinstein and Casey Affleck are not the same, but they’ve both benefited from the same system: one in which powerful men protect other powerful men, and reporters are pressured not to publish certain stories or ask certain questions. Casey Affleck’s career flourished even after two women came forward to accuse him of sexual harassment. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon actively threw their support behind him, and it’s safe to say that that A-list backing helped accelerate the collective amnesia that allowed Hollywood to forgive Casey’s alleged misconduct. After Casey Affleck
It seems like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon take no issue with the culture of silence when it is convenient to them, and are quick to harness their power in order to protect family and friends. But when it is no longer permissible to be associated with a known abuser, they distance themselves with vague statements, performing disgust and horror, evoking their wives and daughters. Condemning Weinstein now that he is too toxic to collaborate with does not an ally make; particularly when we’re dealing with men like Damon and Affleck who have historically aided alleged abusers and worked to preserve their Teflon reputations.",unknown,True

The backtracking didn’t work. Key allies have abandoned Bannon, including Breitbart backer Rebekah Mercer, whose family also supported Trump’s presidential campaign. President Trump has not amended a blistering denunciation of Bannon, his former confidant and campaign manager.
Despite Bannon’s departure, former Breitbart spokesperson Kurt Bardella said it probably would not be the last we heard of him. He said Bannon — who Trump detractors sometimes called “President Bannon” because of his influence — has even considered his own political career.
“I don’t think he’ll be quiet or silent for very long. Acceptance fate or defeat is not in his DNA,” Bardella told TheWrap. “Someone who entertains running for president doesn’t just retreat and shrink away into anonymity. He will try and reinvent himself. He will try and finish what he started.”
“I’m very surprised,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who speaks with Bannon regularly. “I thought everything subsided after the weekend.”
Former Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos told TheWrap that people lacing into Bannon now were “hypocrites,” and he too predicted another act.
“The people knifing Steve now are cowards and hypocrites,” said Yiannopoulos. “They were perfectly happy to suck up to him when he had the President’s ear.

We have our own pro facto dhimmis in the United States. They are people who believe that if they support and promote everything Islamic, they will escape being labeled Islamophobes or attacked by Muslims. They are paying dearly for this benefit.
President Trump, by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, told the world that he would not be a dhimmi. One would think when he decided to move the U.S. embassy that he had given the city to Israel, but Jerusalem has been Israeli land since the war of June 1967 and a decisive and miraculous victory. That victory led to the reunification of the Jewish people with their holy city after 2,000 years of exile.
Mr. Trump, in moving the embassy to Israel’s proclaimed capital and honoring the U.S. Senate vote of 1995, refused to submit as a dhimmi to the intimidation and fact twisting of the Muslim nations, who are themselves backed by the dhimmis of the United Nations. He did what nine American presidents before him were afraid to do.
The Muslim nations, after their humiliating defeat in the war of 1967, refused to acknowledge the loss, and the U.N. helped them to solidify their pathological denial by issuing the infamous United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.

0000955,A small-R republican gripe: Can we stop capitalizing ‘president’?!,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Somewhere along the way of writing up information about the president — that’s president with a small “p” in this context, not capital “P” — grammar-tarians lost their grammatical compass. Or maybe it was political hacks, either unschooled, unconcerned or undisciplined about the finer points of proper punctuation, or worse, purposely trying to turn the president into a All Hail the President with a capital “P,” no matter the context.
Who knows.
Either way, what’s happened is they started writing President when it should be president. It’s been going on for some time, pre-
This is not simply a Grammar Police matter.
This is a particular gripe because it places the president in a spot of honor he just doesn’t deserve — really, in a place of respect that better belongs with the People, or the Citizens, or maybe even the Taxpayers.
Better to capitalize those words than “president.”
You see, when president is President, even when grammar says he should be president, the message to the reader is this: The President is a Very Important Person — so important that even his title must always be capitalized.
But lookie here. We don’t even do that with God.
Why so with president-slash-President?
In a January 3 email from the White House Office of Communications, a statement from President
Wrong. It’s presidency, small “p.”
In a December email from the same office, it was more of the same, with a message that opened, “The President,” that should have read “The president.”
This isn’t just coming from the ideological right.
In a January 4 email from the left-leaning pro-immigrant nonprofit, America’s Voice, a statement read: “For some Republicans … the strategy is pretty clear: pretend you want a deal (because the President has said he wants one … “
Again, it’s “the president,” people.
It’s not just emailed notifications. It’s official WhiteHouse.gov communications, notifications and posts.

No. No, no, no, no, no and no once more. These are not simple faux pas, the work of grammar-challenged entities. They’re elevations of importance that should not be.
It’s President
And perhaps, that’s a good way to remember it.
The president of the United States, no matter how honorable, no matter how great, no matter how awesome of all awesomeness in policy, politics and partisan bent, is still, here in America, a servant. A servant of the people.
A servant of the American people.
His title is not one of reverence. His name isn’t spoken in hushed whispers. Moreover, America is not a nation that regards titles with awe or reverence. We’re all equal here — no caste system in sight.
So let’s remember: The White House chief is just a dude. He’s not God, or even a god. Let’s put the “p’s” into proper grammatical context. If anyone deserves a consistently capitalized letter — outside of God, that is — it’s the citizens who elect, the taxpayers who employ, the patriots who defend.

0000958,"Chelsea Clinton Attempts To BURN Republicans In Tweet, Instead Massively INSULTS Michelle Obama","No, you can’t have your pudding, EVEN if you eat your beans!! My, how lib regressives change their narrative…..lost souls that can never be healed! In other words mentally unstable.
Did you hear? Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of YOUR former President Bill Clinton and his crazy wife Hillary Clinton has just inadvertently ripped former lady Michelle Obama a new one, and it’s all over Twitter. Chelsea hit her Twitter this week to give her two cents on a recent study that showed that kids learn better and are far more attentive and retain their learning when they are not hungry and eat foods that are of nutritional value to their brains and growth.
“Research again confirms kids pay more attention in class &amp; better retain what they’re taught when they’re not hungry,” Clinton wrote.
When one Twitter user replied and said the study’s results were obvious, Clinton used the opportunity to bash Republicans, writing that Republicans have been trying to repeal free lunches and block nutritional food requirements.
“Sadly, many Republicans continue to argue against free school lunches &amp; breakfasts &amp; against nutritional support for families,” Clinton wrote.
Now of course, her goal was to hit at Republicans, but what Chelsea ACTUALLY did was throw shade at former First Lady, Michelle Obama. While Obama was in office, Michelle Obama took it upon herself to overhaul school lunches on a national level and expanded the free and reduced lunch program. The problem was the changes that they implemented were not received well at all and the proof is on social media where students have posted pictures of the unappetizing and small lunches they had started receiving under Obama’s plan. With captions that were anything but complimentary.
So, you can imagine the response Chelsea got right?
Chelsea has been getting more than the usual amount of news coverage lately even if it is negative and in reaction to some of her amazingly dumb statements. Here she is making statements about things I doubt she can be called an expert on. I wonder if she’s being programmed by people who can’t wait to slap ”Chelsea 2024” on their bumpers. If this is the case, then her advisers aren’t any brighter than the masterminds of ”Hillary 2016.”

Please watch this. The surprise and relief on these taxpayers’ faces is palpable. I wonder why they’re so surprised that their taxes are going down?
This is exactly the dynamic Republicans are hoping for in 2018. Democrats and many members of the media relentlessly claimed the bill would hurt the middle class. They called it a “giveaway” to corporate America and to the very rich. Polls indicated that large numbers of Americans actually thought their taxes would increase. In other words, the public debate served mainly to obscure the truth and conceal the benefits to working families. So what happens when reality intervenes and Americans by the millions see their take-home pay increase? The GOP’s hope is that it will lead to a public reconsideration and a rebound in Republican fortunes at the polls. And that’s certainly possible. There has been an enormous amount of doom-mongering in the media and online, and if Republicans can keep America safe and prosperous in the coming year, and if family fortunes continue to improve, then some of the hysteria may lose its bite. Eventually people tune out Chicken Little.

0000961,Criminal Minds - Blue Angel - Review: “Retribution”,"Don’t let the title of this review fool you. Despite its ominous tone, it’s only in reference to this episode’s case. Yes, just like with our last episode, this is another typical case of the week outing, with all the drama being confined only to the case itself. Unlike the previous case, however, this one wasn’t quite so clear-cut and predictable. That’s a good thing, too, as it kept me, and likely many other viewers guessing for much of the episode, and gave us some intriguing and genuinely unsettling moments along the way.
This episode also gave us a glimpse into new team member Matt Simmons’ home life. Since those who watched “Beyond Borders” got to know him pretty well on there, they kept the “personal life” bits fairly brief, but even then, it was a nice bit of light, fluffy distraction, which, given all we’ve seen these characters go through thus far, was a welcome change of pace.
The moments with Matt were also a nice balance to the dark and creepy nature of the case itself. Thankfully, the show spared us seeing any grotesque images this week, but our imaginations weren’t quite as lucky, if the descriptions we heard throughout are anything to go by. Brace yourselves as we prepare to wade through this messed up nightmare.
The Case:
Things start off on a mysterious note, as we see a car driving into a dark, wooded area. A person decked out in black, their face completely shrouded, grabs some sharp instruments, so it’s pretty clear at this point that something nefarious is afoot.
Sure enough, that winds up being true, as the mystery person enters some sort of building, where there’s even more sharp instruments, along with a wheelchair. They seem to be examining if the place is ready, and evidently it is, as they return to their car shortly afterward, only to reveal somebody is being held captive in the trunk. A poor guy’s already crappy night is about to get even worse.
That poor guy’s name, as we soon learn is Curtis, and Emily informs us, and the team, of the nightmare he suffered. Garcia tries to be as delicate as possible as she helps fill in the details, but even then, the facts are still pretty graphic. Curtis was hung in the warehouse, after having suffered all sorts of severe injuries – cuts and bruises and the like.
Oh, yeah, and the unsub completely chopped off his entire manhood as well. So that’s disturbing. Reid’s reaction to this unpleasant bit of news was pretty similar to mine.
As is par for the course with this show, this is clearly not the unsub’s first kill, either. A man named Darrel had been found dead recently as well, and sure enough, he was murdered the same way Curtis was. Tara and Matt throw out a few potential theories regarding the graphic nature of these murders; she suggests potential drug cartels, while he wonders if this is the work of the Chaldean Mafia, a brutal and notorious organization based out of Detroit. Matt had become familiar with their crimes when he worked in that state years prior. As the team prepare to head out to Detroit, we see another man being held captive and pleading for his life, so yep, there’ll soon be a new body waiting for the team when they arrive.
Judging from what little info the team can gleam about Curtis and Darrel, they don’t seem like obvious targets. Curtis was an attorney, and that job comes with its own risks, but this sort of murder seems a bit over the top in terms of potential retaliation. And Darrel was about as mild-mannered as they come. However, both men did recently withdraw nearly ten thousand dollars, which, naturally, gets the red flags up. People generally don’t pull that large an amount of money just for the heck of it. Later, when Matt and Emily interview Curtis’ wife, they get a better idea of just why Curtis could’ve been using that money. According to her, Curtis handled the family finances, and her reaction to the transactions indicates she suspected her husband was sneaking around on her. Combine that suspicion with him blowing tons of money on a woman, and the team’s been down this road enough times to know what’s likely going on. Curtis, and Darrel, were paying for escorts.
“They were honest relationships. More honest than marriage, I’d say.”
With Garcia’s help, the team learns about a site called Blue Siren, which initially looks like your average dating site, but is quickly revealed to be an escort service website. And the woman Curtis and Darrel met up with was named Dasha. Clearly a professional name. After finding out where the Blue Siren headquarters are (apparently it’s in a college sorority house, which is interesting), JJ and Luke head out there to interview a woman who works for that site. She’s not there when they arrive, but another woman who worked with her tells them that her real name is actually Kimberly. She’s no longer part of the Blue Siren group, but the woman confirms that Curtis and Darrel did visit the Blue Siren site, and were likely involved with Kimberly at some point. Kimberly insists that her relationships with the men she saw were purely innocent and safe, though.
Emily and Matt later track down Kimberly herself, and they inform her about the murders. She’s understandably horrified, and starts to fear that she might be a target as well. As a result, Emily sets up a protective detail for her, and Matt does his part by staying and keeping her company for the night. She discusses how easy it is for married men to be lured in by women like her, because of the forbidden nature of the encounter, and even attempts a slight flirtation of her own. Matt ain’t biting, though. He's got a job to do, dagnabit.
Elsewhere, JJ and Luke talk to Kimberly’s mom, Janel. She’s not happy about the life her daughter’s been living, and expresses concern about her well-being. She also reveals that Kimberly’s dad died when she was young, and she doesn’t have any siblings, or other extended family. Seems it’s pretty much just been Kimberly and her mom against the world all this time. And as Garcia soon discovers, the men in Kimberly’s family all tended to die young. Odd.
“Sick bastard made a snuff film.”
While all this is going on, Reid is busy examining some videotapes that had been sent to the local police. These tapes contain footage of the poor men being mercilessly tortured, and they’re pretty gruesome, if the reactions of everyone watching are anything to go by. The local officers are puzzled about the means by which the tapes were sent - they were recorded on cassette, of all things. What this means about their unsub, they’re still not entirely sure, but in the meantime, Reid does manage to get a few audio and visual clues as to where this warehouse is.
As the team arrives to investigate the warehouse, things get even creepier and more surprising. The unsub, upon seeing the team show up, decides to destroy and set fire to the entire place, causing just enough of a distraction for them to escape. In the aftermath of the fire, the team finds a symbol related to the Chaldean Mafia, indicating Matt’s initial assumption is right, and they also discover a woman’s skull in the backyard as well. It’s soon revealed that the skull belongs to a woman named Cynthia, and that she’s apparently been dead for quite some time. This discovery comes on the heels of the recent murder of a third man named Philip. What initially looked like a relatively simple string of murders targeting men who visited escorts is becoming an increasingly complex mystery with each passing moment, as the victim type continues to change and shift.
That becomes even more apparent when the unsub soon targets Janel and Kimberly themselves, managing to overpower and get past the protective detail before kidnapping them. It’s at this point we finally see who our unsub is, and it turns out it’s a man – and one Janel and Kimberly are apparently familiar with, if the man’s chilling “Welcome home” greeting to them is any indication.
Both women attempt to placate this guy, but he doesn’t seem all that interested in listening to them. At least, not at first. Soon, though, he starts to get emotional, apologizing to Janel for abandoning her. Janel doesn’t seem to like where this conversation’s going and tries to stop it, but the cat slips out of the bag anyway. Kimberly soon learns the same thing the team recently discovered: Janel isn’t her mom. She’s her aunt. And the unsub, whose name is Gabriel, is Kimberly’s father. Quite a couple big bombshells to drop at a time like this, no? Gabriel soon reveals that his main reason for his killing spree is a chance to “fix everything”. Once he’s gotten rid of the men who took advantage of his sweet, innocent daughter, he can try and work on starting a new life with Kimberly. Second chances are all well and good, but in this particular case, yeah, thinking that’s gonna be a hard sell for her, buddy.
Janel soon confirms Gabriel’s story, and when she goes to talk to him, Kimberly attempts to escape. A scuffle occurs, during which Janel stabs Gabriel in the back, and while he’s distracted with the knife, Kimberly flees. Thankfully, before Gabriel can off Janel for good and chase after his daughter, the team arrives, pulling Kimberly and Janel to safety. Gabriel attempts his own escape, but after a brief but intense wrestling match between him and Matt, Matt gains the upper hand and takes him in.
This of course begs the question: if Janel was really Kimberly’s aunt, then what happened to her mother? Well, remember poor Cynthia and her skull? Yep. There’s your answer. After their daughter was born back in 1996, Cynthia obviously didn’t want Gabriel's mafia lifestyle to impact their child, so she’d planned on leaving him. What’s more, she also threatened to alert the authorities to his crimes. Gabriel couldn’t have that, so he killed Cynthia and then turned Kimberly over to his sister, Janel, allowing her to raise the girl. Janel was so disturbed by her brother’s criminal history that she decided to keep all of this a secret from Kimberly for years in an attempt to protect her.
Unfortunately, for all Gabriel’s attempts to stay out of prison, he did wind up serving some time for his crimes. After being released, he attempted to turn over a new leaf and tried to reconnect with Kimberly. Once he found out what she was doing for a living, however, he couldn’t help sliding back into his old criminal ways in his own twisted attempt to protect her, and as a result, a lot of men wound up paying the ultimate price.
“You’re not like him.”
Kimberly is understandably shaken by the events of the case and all the new information she’s learned, to the point where she expresses regret to Matt that he didn’t kill her father. So much for any hope of a family reunion, then. She does, however, point out that Matt reminded her that good men do exist out there, and is bolstered by his kind and supportive words about herself and her aunt.
Kudos to the show for giving us an unpredictable case this go-round. When I first saw the promos and sneak peeks for it, and even while observing Kimberly and Janel’s behavior throughout early on, I’d initially assumed our unsub would be one of those women. Maybe somebody in this organization had had enough of some shady stuff that had been going down, be it within the organization itself or with the men the women met up with, and wanted to fight back. Maybe Janel was a bitter woman whose husband had left her for, or had an affair with, a prostitute, and she wanted to destroy that system from within. Then when Garcia mentioned the fact that the men in Kimberly’s family died young, I started wondering if this wasn’t some sort of family affair. Perhaps Janel and Kimberly were a criminal duo.
Honestly, I still kind of wish the episode had gone with that kind of premise, because I think it could’ve been a rather interesting route to go, and because I feel like the story about the men in Kimberly’s family dying young was a tantalizing tidbit that was ultimately left danging when it should’ve been explored further. That said, I do appreciate that Gabriel’s motive wasn’t as clear-cut as one would initially think. The mafia aspect, while perhaps adding a little too much clutter to an already complex case, certainly provided a powerful motive for some of his murders, as well as a plausible explanation for how he became such an effective killing machine.
I particularly liked the push and pull between Gabriel wanting to redeem himself and start anew with his daughter and his sister and being lured back into his old criminal ways. I wish the show had explored that struggle a little more, instead of waiting until late in the episode to bring it up, especially given how he didn’t seem to show much remorse when he was holding Janel and Kimberly captive. At the same time, though, it was clear that Gabriel was a very broken and confused man, and I do think those aspects of his personality and mindset did come through well enough during his family confrontation, to where you could see his struggle to some degree.
Kimberly and Janel made for intriguing characters, too. Even when Kimberly did try and come on all alluring while talking with Matt, it came off more as her just falling back on her usual means of communicating with men. I thought that was a good, subtle way to show just how much this job has affected her. And considering her comfort in knowing that Matt was a good, trustworthy man, it was clear some of her behavior towards him had been a test, too. I like that she got to see an example of a decent man in action.
And I felt for poor Janel, with the thought of just how many secrets she was carrying on her shoulders for so long. I like that her protectiveness wasn’t so overt, that for the most part, it came out in very realistic, quiet ways. That helped make the moment when she tried to stab Gabriel all the more shocking and powerful. Janel definitely came off as one of those “beware the quiet ones” sorts. I liked seeing both women doing what they could to fight back, and that they were both savvy and had strong self-preservation instincts, both in regards to the case and their lives in general.
My biggest gripes were these four aspects:
1) Could’ve done without Gabriel’s whole “this is why I’m doing what I do” speech towards the end. I get that that was supposed to be part of what unsubs like him do, but it just came off way too much like one of those “bad guy stops to give a speech to the good guy about their plans” moments you see in movies. I think the reveal might’ve come off more intimidating and unsettling if he’d forced Janel to be the one to confess everything to Kimberly, and hadn’t said a word himself.
2) Much as I liked seeing Matt’s physical abilities when taking Gabriel down in that alleyway, ummm...where, exactly, was his backup? Given all the team’s been through lately, you’d think that nobody would be going anywhere without at least one person tagging along. Matt should’ve had somebody behind him the whole time.
3) Gabriel pulling the knife out of his back felt a little “super strength”-y, no? Maybe if he hadn’t spent so much time yammering on about why he was killing people to Janel and Kimberly, he could’ve avoided being stabbed in the first place.
4) Why, exactly, was the episode called “Blue Angel”? Nothing in the episode gave a nod to it, except for the Blue Siren website, but even then, there was no indication that it had any angelic undertones. I’m presuming the “angel” part could’ve been referring to Kimberly, given her family’s concerns about somebody as innocent as her getting caught up in this sleazy business, but even then, it feels a bit of a stretch, so...yeah. Go figure.
Those issues aside, though, I think this case generally worked pretty well overall. Everyone played a role of some sort in it, the variety of potential suspects added to the mystery and suspense, and we got to sympathize with the victims along the way. Even the men who visited the website weren’t necessarily evil bad guys (with the exception, perhaps, of Curtis, ‘cause of the whole “cheating on his wife” thing, but yeah). This is how I want to see the cases of the week going forward – not so over the top that they become ridiculous, but with just enough zigzags throughout to keep us guessing and wondering how it will all play out.
Meanwhile, back at Quantico:
Not a whole lot to report on here, honestly. Reid talked to Garcia and Luke about possible ideas of things to discuss in his upcoming seminars, and we got brief peeks at Matt’s home life. “Beyond Borders” viewers know that Matt's married and has a gaggle full of kids, and sure enough, we got to see the whole brood this episode. The kids don’t show up until the end, when they all crowd into bed with their parents, but it was a cute scene nonetheless.
And I liked what we saw of Matt’s wife, too. Her name is Kristy, and she seems pretty darn happy with her husband’s new job. When Matt was with the International Response Team, he was away a lot, but apparently, now that he’s at the BAU, he has better hours and more time at home with his family. Which is interesting, considering how often this team seems to be away from home, and how common an issue this job was for other team members’ relationships and families over the years. I suppose, though, it’s easier to deal with the separation that comes from being in another part of the U.S. as opposed to being in another part of the world altogether.
We also learned that nearly ten years into their marriage, Matt and Kristy are still as lovey-dovey as ever, to the point where he managed to tempt her back to bed for a little morning fun before work. I hope the show continues to let this marriage last. The guys on the team generally haven’t had much luck in the romance department, after all – either their wives or girlfriends died, or in the case of Stephen, he was the one to be killed off. Morgan was the only male team member to go off to a happy life with Savannah. So it’d be nice to have Matt and Kristy’s relationship play out as well as Morgan’s did. Buck the trend a little more.
As for Reid, I enjoyed seeing him discussing his seminars. He was excited about them in a way that showed the old Reid spark was back (or at least, on its way back), and we also got to learn about an interesting fallacy known as “the Linda problem” in the process. Long story short, it’s a conjunction fallacy that deals with people’s assumptions that two separate events may be connected, when it’s just as probable, if not more so, that they happened completely independent of each other. It’s just the sort of problem that I could see Reid being interested in, and what made it all the more fun was that Garcia was as knowledgeable about it as he was, and that they got to chat about it a bit. Always fun to be reminded of just how much Reid and Garcia have in common.
It was nice to see Luke showing interest in their discussion as well, even if he agrees with Garcia that it might be a bit over most agents’ heads. I personally think it’d be a perfect topic to cover, given that the conjunction fallacy is something that can and has come up in this line of work before. Whether Reid does wind up discussing “the Linda problem” in his seminars or not, I hope we get more glimpses at what he wants to teach, and eventually, what he does decide to teach. It’s just good to see Reid acting like himself again, and having something to look forward to to boot.
So that’s that. Another week, another normal outing. How long this trend will continue to last, I don’t know, but for now, I’m fine with the peace and quiet.
What did you think of the episode? Did the case play out as you’d predicted, or did it provide some surprises along the way? Did you enjoy the glimpse into Matt’s home life? Do you have any fun ideas regarding topics for Reid to cover in his seminars? Share your thoughts in the comments!

0000962,Anarchists take over anti-racism protest at Worcester City Hall,"Mark Sullivan Telegram &amp; Gazette Staff @mcnsullivan
Aug 13, 2017 at 10:56 PM
WORCESTER - Masked anarchists hijacked a peaceful anti-racism rally at City Hall Plaza on Sunday, tying up traffic while marching down Main Street shouting epithets at “racist cops.”
At least three people were arrested.
The protest came at the end of the Rally Against Racism organized by the group Showing Up for Racial Justice in response to the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.
More than 250 people, many of them parents with children, attended the 6 p.m. rally, holding signs and cheering a lineup of speakers who denounced racism and oppression.
At the close of the rally, members of the anti-fascist group Worcester Antifa, kerchiefs on their faces, one carrying a black flag, scaled an off-limits staircase in the front of City Hall to hang their banner, reading “Put Racism on the Run,” over a balcony.
When police officers told them they must leave the City Hall balcony, the crowd below shouted “Let them be!” and “No justice, no peace, no racist police!”
That was a lead-in to a march down Main Street, dozens of protesters blocking traffic while walking in the middle of the street until police ordered them back on the sidewalk. “Hey, hey, ho ho, these racist cops have got to go!” the protesters shouted as they marched as far as 674 Main St., the Odd Fellows Building, by the Compare Foods grocery.
There, a protester was arrested, prompting shouts of “Let him go!” The marchers turned around and headed back toward City Hall, escorted by a line of police cruisers. “Whose streets? Our streets!” they shouted. Police dogs inside a K9 unit wagon barked loudly.
Police sirens and flashers filled the summer night air after the protesters regrouped at City Hall, then headed in the direction of the police station to bail out an arrested demonstrator. At least two more protesters were arrested on the march to the station. Police sirens drowned out the anti-police chants as the marchers passed Mechanics Hall.
The main rally was a family-friendly event. Parents and children with homemade signs staked out spots around the plaza. “Hate has no home here,” one sign read. “Teach love,” read another. One woman wore a “Resist Fascism” kerchief on her head.
Loree Burns, 47, of West Boylston, held a handmade sign that read “On the Side of (Love),” with a large heart. She was attending with her daughter, Catherine, 15, and friend Marissa Gardner, 14.
“I think what happened in Charlottesville was reprehensible,” Ms. Burns said. “The only thing that I could do right now is stand up in solidarity with the people of Charlottesville.”
The girls’ signs read, “Warrior of Love,” and “Love Makes the World Go Round.”
“When I saw on the news what happened in Charlottesville, I was really disgusted and upset at what people thought was OK and was right,” said Ms. Gardner. “I think it’s really important to organize and show the actions of a few do not really stand for all of us.”
Said the younger Ms. Burns: “We just need to keep the love going.”
Nearby, a couple in colorful tie-dyed shirts stood with their son and their collection of signs. Aimee Ledwell, 42, of Maynard, was penning “End Racism Now” on the back of a piece of poster board. Husband Joshua, 44, held their Black Lives Matter lawn sign. And son C.J., 8, had drawn a sign reading “Let Love and Kindness Grow,” with a picture of his cat.
“We of course are always standing on the side of love,” Mrs. Ledwell said. “After the violence this weekend, we could not just stay at home and not come and stand up for what’s right. So here we are.”
Mrs. Ledwell was asked what she hoped would be the takeaway from the anti-racism rally.
“The more people who stand up the better,” she said. “The more we have big crowds gathering and saying, ‘No, this is not normal,’ ‘This is not OK,’ the more people will come and join them, too.
“There is still a lot of fear. People have a hard time standing up. The more people do, you get momentum. And hopefully that momentum can make a difference every time.”
Not 20 feet away from the family group, on the fringe of the crowd, stood several Antifa protesters, some wearing kerchiefs and black masks on their faces, holding signs that read “Resist Racism: Solidarity with Charlottesville.”
“Don’t take my (expletive) picture,” one man with a kerchief around his face told an elderly woman who was taking a photo of the rally.
The masked people, who were standing over an American flag on the ground, refused to be interviewed by the Telegram &amp; Gazette.
“I’m not going to answer any of your questions,” said a man with a black mask covering his face who was standing over the American flag.
A woman with the group told the reporter: “This is harassment.” Asked what they planned to do with the flag, she said: “Please stop harassing them.”
“What are you doing with a notepad?” asked another woman with the group. “If they don’t want to talk to you, you can probably just (expletive) off.” Asked why the others were covering their faces, she said: “You really should leave.”
Asked if she felt non-violence was the way, she declined to speak.
The Antifa protesters, numbering perhaps a couple dozen, were a small percentage of the crowd for the main rally, which drew hundreds.
Matt Vahallas, 41, of Holden, held a sign picturing the Blues Brothers, with a quote from the movie: “I Hate (expletive) Nazis.” Mr. Vahallas said he was inspired to attend by the weekend’s swastika-waving demonstration in Charlottesville. “I thought World War II solved that problem,” he said.
Toward the end of the rally, the crowd was encouraged to join in chants. “No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA,” they shouted. Then: “What do we want? Justice! If we don’t get it? Shut it down!”
Soon thereafter, the Antifa people scaled the City Hall stairs, hung their banner from the balcony, and the mood turned.
The main Rally Against Racism was organized by the Worcester chapter of the activist organization Showing Up for Social Justice in response to the events in Charlottesville.
“Part of (our) cause is to call out racism and call white people into action when things like that happen,” said an organizer, Etel Haxhiaj, 37, of Worcester.
Ms. Haxhiaj, interviewed in advance of the rally, was asked about Antifa. She declined to comment on the group.
Seven members of the group Worcester Antifa - short for Worcester Anti-Fascist Action — were arrested in February during a protest in downtown Worcester in which they blocked traffic while chanting profane slogans against police, the Ku Klux Klan and fascism.
The Antifa movement nationally and internationally describes its approach as “a confrontational response to fascist groups, rooted in militant left-wing and anarchist politics,” according to the magazine The Nation.",unknown,False
0000963,Trump Embraces the Culture War,"To attend the Indianapolis Colts game where the number of the legendary Peyton Manning was to be retired, Vice President Mike Pence, a former governor of Indiana, flew back from Las Vegas.
With him in the stadium was his wife Karen. In honor of Manning, she wore a No. 18 jersey as “The Star Spangled Banner” began.
The Pences stood, hands over hearts. A dozen San Francisco 49ers took a knee. When the national anthem ended, Pence walked out. His limousine took him back to the airport to fly to LA.
“A stunt! That plane trip cost taxpayers $250,000,” wailed a media that was rarely critical of Michelle Obama’s million-dollar junkets with Sasha and Malia.
The president took credit for Pence’s walkout, tweeting, “I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled.”
Pence’s statement: “I left today’s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.”
As Pence had left his press pool in the motorcade, and said he might not be too long, the walkout may not have been entirely spontaneous. But the game had been on Pence’s calendar for weeks.
What does this episode tell us?
In the culture wars, Trump has rejected compromise or capitulation and decided to defend the ground on which his most loyal folks stand.
Example: While The Washington Post was reporting Monday that Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, and Denver had now joined Los Angeles in replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous People’s Day, Trump issued a Columbus Day proclamation of bristling defiance.
“Five hundred and twenty-five years ago, Christopher Columbus completed an ambitious and daring voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. … a remarkable and then-unparalleled feat that helped launch the age of exploration and discovery. The permanent arrival of Europeans to the Americas was a transformative event that … changed the course of human history and set the stage for the development of our great Nation.”
Columbus, said Trump, was a “skilled navigator and man of faith, whose courageous feat brought together continents and has inspired countless others to pursue their dreams and convictions — even in the face of extreme doubt and tremendous adversity.”
The Admiral of the Ocean Sea “was a native of the City of Genoa, in present day Italy, and represents the rich history of important Italian American contributions to our great Nation. … Italy is a strong ally and a valued partner,” said Trump.
His proclamation failed to mention indigenous peoples.
How did CNN receive it? Not at all well.
“Trump’s Praise of Columbus Omits Dark History,” ran the CNN headline. Lede sentence: “Never mind the disease and slavery wrought by Christopher Columbus’ voyage — or the fact that he didn’t actually ‘discover’ the New World.”
Trump’s proclamation closed a week in which he rolled back the Obamacare mandate requiring employers and institutions, against their religious beliefs, to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing pills to employees.
Religious groups cheered. The ACLU fumed. The in-your-face defiance of the dictates of political correctness has solidified Trump’s base behind him.
And Americans are coming to accept our new reality: On the essentials of nationhood — ancestry, morality, faith, culture, history, heroes — we really are no longer one nation and one people.
All weekend, viewers of cable TV were treated to self-righteous wailing from the acolytes of Colin Kaepernick, patron saint of the 49ers, that “taking the knee” to protest racism and racist cops is a most admirable exercise of the First Amendment right to protest.
What Trump’s folks are saying in response is this:
“You may have a First Amendment right to disrespect our flag, or even to burn it, but you have no right to make us listen to you, or respect you, or buy tickets to your games, or watch you on Sunday.”
And with shrinking audiences watching NFL games, declining attendance, and advertisers beginning to bail, the NFL appears belatedly to be getting the message.
Jerry Jones, owner of one of the most valuable franchises in the league, has told players that anyone who does not show respect for the flag during the national anthem does not play that day for the Dallas Cowboys.
“President Trump has a duty to unite us, not divide us” is the mantra of our elites. Yet since the ’60s, it is these elites who have been imposing the social, moral, and cultural revolution the American people never voted for and which has by now divided us irretrievably.
Call them “deplorables” if you will, but Trump does seem to relish going out to defend the views, values, and beliefs of the people who put him where he is. He does not recoil from political conflict.
People who stand by you in a fight are not all that common in politics. When Trump exhibits this quality, he receives in reciprocity the kind of loyalty even his enemies concede he has.

0000964,Gender Ideology’s Kindergarten Commissars,"If you, being a monstrous bigot, didn’t take your small child to
Angry parents stampeded a California charter school board meeting Monday after a teacher read her kindergarten class picture books about transgenderism to affirm a gender dysphoric classmate. During the class, parents say, the gender dysphoric boy also switched clothes to look more like a girl in a “gender reveal.”
Parents were not notified beforehand of the discussion or the classmate’s psychological condition, and learned about it when their confused kindergarteners arrived home from school that day.
“The kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,” Karen England of the Capitol Resource Institute told CBS News.
“My daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,” a parent said at the public meeting.
This is not a one-off situation. As Joy Pullman explains,
Nova is a test case for what trans activists want to perpetuate nationwide — and not just in public schools, but also in private and home schools. An
Yesterday I heard from a Washington, DC, reader whose children attended a public charter school, until he and his wife found out what the school was doing behind their backs. He sent me the e-mail chain between him and the school’s principal. I reproduce it here with his permission, and with the names of the people involved and the school redacted:
Dear [Principal],
Raising little ones is hard these days, particularly because — even by ages five and six — kids on the playground are educating them about topics I didn’t even know much about until I was a preteen. Consequently, my wife and I began talking to the girls about sexuality in age-appropriate ways last year. It’s a sensitive area, but we wanted to go ahead and introduce our values to them early on, before a kid at school did and potentially caused confusion.
In that spirit, last weekend I decided to talk to the girls about the topic of people who identify as transgendered. Shortly after starting the conversation, however, I learned that [their teacher] had already talked to [our daughter] and her classmates about it. This involved her reading a book called
First of all, let me say this: [my wife] and I think a lot of [the teacher]. She has been an excellent teacher and [our daughter] has seen great progress in her class. Furthermore, she has made a point to encourage us and compliment [our daughter’s] progress anytime she sees us. She’s a good and professional teacher, and I suppose that’s part of the reason we were so disappointed. We wouldn’t have expected it from her. And even though I’m sure she meant well, those good intentions don’t make [our daughter’s] experience any more appropriate, especially because I had already let the school know my wishes about any such discussion with the students.
Before enrolling the girls, I explicitly told you that if there was any reason the school felt the need to discuss topics including sexuality, marriage norms, or gender identity, I wanted to be notified so that my children could be excused, giving me the opportunity to decide when they were ready for that discussion. You assured me that the school would never even broach these subjects with the kids. Just to be on the safe side, however, at our home visits, I also explicitly told the teachers the same.
The classroom was not the place to conduct a discussion like this with first graders — the home is. [Our daughter] was confused by the discussion and book, and it required me to spend 20 minutes just to undo the odd and incorrect conclusions she drew about transgendered individuals from [the teacher’s] lesson and even the storyline of the book. That confusion could’ve been avoided by giving parents notification beforehand or not even discussing it at all with first graders.
The sad thing is that I would’ve never even known it happened if I hadn’t decided to have this conversation that, quite frankly, I thought might be a little too mature for their ages. But we can’t unspill the milk, so I am asking you to do the following to make things right: (1) notify all parents about what happened so they can have a chance to discuss this with their own children; (2) apologize to all of us for exploring this topic with our kids without seeking our permission; (3) inform all parents of any other instances in which such a discussion happened or any comments were made regarding gender identity, marriage norms, and sexuality; and (4) let us know what remedial measures the school will take to ensure this will not happen again.
Despite the excellent job you all are otherwise doing, this was a violation of every parents’ trust and rooted in the assumption that we are all in agreement with the ideology of the staff members. But more importantly and fundamentally, even if parents are in agreement with the ideology of staff members, this decision assumed that the school, rather than parents, is in the best position to decide when to approach hard topics like this with our children.
It is not my intent to discourage [the teacher] at all — again, we have otherwise been so pleased with her work with [our daughter] this year; but I just can’t overlook this breach of trust and I think other parents also have a right to know it happened so they can address it at home as necessary. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Having not heard from the principal, the father wrote:
[Principal], [my wife] and I were hoping to hear back from you about our email to you. Maybe it would be better if we met in person. When are you available in the next two weeks?
The principal responded:
We are the height of planning for school opening. My apologies I did not respond sooner.
As a mother and school leader, I can empathize with the challenge of keeping up with what our children are exposed to and wanting to be their first teacher on so many issues.
I also think well of [the teacher]. She has shown herself to be a proficient teacher and student advocate.
I do not recall a conversation about how we would handle conversations about transgender issues, but I cannot imagine agreeing either to censure such material or inform you in advance. I am sorry if [the teacher] or I led you to believe such a request would be honored.
The book used is one that is a respected text in honoring the diversity of our children. It is a text that explains a real situation that many children face in self-acceptance, acceptance by others and being true to themselves. We feel the classroom is the appropriate place to share such messages.
We would not request that these themes require permission, or clearance with families. (Different than courses on sexual education, for which we do require permission.) Quite the contrary, families have asked that we enhance our curriculum to be more inclusive of all the different groups our children and families represent, and we feel that this book achieves this purpose.
I stand by [the teacher’s] use of the book in class, her decision to share the text, and the importance of these texts in the elementary classroom.
I am happy to meet with you to listen or answer any other questions you might have. My time is limited in this month, but I will do my best.
The father replied:
Thanks for getting back in touch with me, [principal]. I realize that you are busy, but do you mind meeting with [my wife] and me briefly before the week is over? We would like to tie up the discussion, but we think it might contribute to mutual understanding if we do it in person.
The principal replied:
I am not available until the school year begins as we are feverishly working to train teachers, prepare the building and open school.
I am copying [my assistant] who can help us set up something for the first week of school.
To which the father wrote:
We still want to get together with you, but if we aren’t able to talk before the school year begins, we would at least like to make sure we understood your email correctly.
[My wife] and I would like our children to be exempt from any classroom discussions or instruction relating to the topics of gender identity, marital norms, or sexuality. We would also like to be informed before any such discussions take place in the classroom. I would like to know if the school will honor that request.
Thanks in advance for letting us know. We know that these are sensitive topics that require great care, which is why we want to be the first ones to talk to our children about it.
The principal did not respond. Six days later, the father wrote:
[Principal], I appreciate how busy you are right now, but if you could please answer the question I emailed last week, I would appreciate it. Good luck with school prep!
The principal responded:
Thank you for understanding that this is an extremely busy time. I will not exempt any child from classroom discussions or instruction relating to the topics of gender identity, and ‘marital norms’.
As it relates to formal instruction regarding sexuality, and sexual reproduction I will ask for your permission before these concepts are introduced in 4th grade. When they are introduced, I can say they are conducted with cultural humility and inclusivity– thoughtful of all our children and all their families.
The parents removed their two children from this public charter school last week in light of the principal’s refusal to respect their wishes or even to tell them when gender identity is going to be discussed in their elementary school classes.
I asked the father if he wanted to go public with this, naming the school — in which case I would need to use their names, and call the principal and the teacher for comment. He said no, that they don’t want a public fight over this issue:
We just want to raise awareness and encourage parents to ask their children direct questions about this kind of stuff. If I hadn’t brought up this topic with my daughter, I would’ve never known what she was exposed to, nor would I have known that the school was systematically indoctrinating kids and doing so behind the backs of parents who had asked them to do otherwise.
Let this be a lesson to you, reader. Do you know what your child’s school’s policy is? Do you know what your child’s teacher thinks about introducing gender ideology to little children? You had better.
Note too, per Joy Pullman, that the campaign to institute gender ideology in elementary schools is not stopping at public schools or at public charter schools. Via the accreditation process, they’re going after private schools. Pullman writes:
The leftists harping on this topic are essentially demanding a religious litmus test — the adoption of the moral belief that every sexual practice must be affirmed — as a precondition for educating children. It is starting with public and private schools, but will eventually encompass “outliers” such as homeschoolers. None of us are safe unless we band together and stop this crazy train in its tracks.
A key problem is that Republican-led statehouses are the ones guarding school choice programs, and these same statehouses can barely muster the votes to protect children in public schools from being forced into unisex shower and sleeping quarters.
I have been told by people involved in this fight that Republican state legislators are getting hammered hard by the big business lobby, which wants to see liberalization of the schools on the SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) front. If these legislators do not hear from their constituents, they will rightly assume that the people they represent don’t care about the issue — and they’ll cave. If this matters to you as a parent, educate yourself — and call your state legislator. If you homeschool or have your kids in a private religious school, do not think that you are safe. (If you don’t belong to the
The other side is not playing around — and it has deep pockets (e.g., The Gates Foundation). In
Social and religious conservatives have lost many battles on this front, but they have not yet lost this one. But you had better be clear that the battle is here — and, as these parents above have learned, in some places it has been joined without parents even knowing what was happening. You cannot afford to be ignorant, nor can you afford to be indifferent. Never, ever forget that the Law Of Merited Impossibility is an infallible guide to progressivist culture war tactics: “It will never happen, and when it does, you bigots will deserve it.”
If your child’s teacher has read I Am Jazz to her, and she wants to know whatever happened to Jazz Jennings, you may want to know that Jennings spoke about this in the media earlier this summer, and has been on the I Am Jazz reality show
UPDATE: Reader Brendan:
I understand the call to arms on this, I really do, but I think that the battle on this has already been quite well and truly lost. The cultural Zeitgeist on this issue has a very “year before Obergefell” feeling to it — in other words, the battle was already over in everything but a formal and official way, and most everyone knew it. It’s the same for this issue — for all practical purposes this is over.
Are there more people squeamish about MTF transwomen in the ladies room today than there were about gay marriage in, say, 2013? Probably. But that sentiment is being very exceptionally and forcefully forced into silence, just as the sentiments about SSM were.
The reason is more or less the same as it was for SSM: corporate America wants it, for several reasons ranging from not wanting to alienate customers who are millenials (who are extremely pro-trans) to not wanting to seem like bigots to their socio-economic peers at the cocktail party. LGBT is a main corporate, capitalist priority currently, and it’s getting pretty much the full support of almost all big enterprises. This makes the issue politically impossible, because the Democrats of course are in bed with LGBT, while the Republicans will generally do what big business wants, which in this case (as in the case of SSM) is pro-LGBT. In that context, there really isn’t any way a fight can really be won here on this issue at this point.
At the end of the day, what parents think on this issue doesn’t matter. What matters is what big business thinks, what the mainstream media thinks, what the Academy thinks and so on. Parents don’t rate, and they will be made to comply with their betters. Just watch.",unknown,True
0000965,Liberalism’s Crack Up,"Lilla, who is a professor of the humanities at Columbia, and who identifies himself as a “frustrated liberal,” says he is struck by the difference between his liberal students and his conservative students. The conservative ones formulate opinions and make arguments based on ideas and principles. The liberal ones, though, base their arguments (such as they are) on an assertion of identity (e.g., “Speaking as a lesbian of color, I believe that…”). Lilla goes on:
Conservatives complain loudest about today’s campus follies, but it is really liberals who should be angry. The big story is not that leftist professors successfully turn millions of young people into dangerous political radicals every year. It is that they have gotten students so obsessed with their personal identities that, by the time they graduate, they have much less interest in, and even less engagement with, the wider political world outside their heads.
There is a great irony in this. The supposedly bland, conventional universities of the 1950s and early ’60s incubated the most radical generation of American citizens perhaps since our founding. Young people were incensed by the denial of voting rights out there, the Vietnam War out there, nuclear proliferation out there, capitalism out there, colonialism out there. Yet once that generation took power in the universities, it proceeded to depoliticize the liberal elite, rendering its members unprepared to think about the common good and what must be done practically to secure it—especially the hard and unglamorous task of persuading people very different from themselves to join a common effort.
Every advance of liberal identity consciousness has marked a retreat of liberal political consciousness. There can be no liberal politics without a sense of We—of what we are as citizens and what we owe each other. If liberals hope ever to recapture America’s imagination and become a dominant force across the country, it will not be enough to beat the Republicans at flattering the vanity of the mythical Joe Sixpack. They must offer a vision of our common destiny based on one thing that all Americans, of every background, share.
And that is citizenship. We must relearn how to speak to citizens as citizens and to frame our appeals for solidarity—including ones to benefit particular groups—in terms of principles that everyone can affirm.
And:
Black Lives Matter is a textbook example of how not to build solidarity. By publicizing and protesting police mistreatment of African-Americans, the movement delivered a wake-up call to every American with a conscience. But its decision to use this mistreatment to build a general indictment of American society and demand a confession of white sins and public penitence only played into the hands of the Republican right.
I am not a black male motorist and will never know what it is like to be one. If I am going to be affected by his experience, I need some way to identify with him, and citizenship is the only thing I know that we share. The more the differences between us are emphasized, the less likely I will be to feel outrage at his mistreatment.
The politics of identity has done nothing but strengthen the grip of the American right on our institutions. It is the gift that keeps on taking. Now is the time for liberals to do an immediate about-face and return to articulating their core principles of solidarity and equal protection for all. Never has the country needed it more.
The essay is adapted from
The Damore debacle at Google is a perfect example of what Lilla disdains in his book. Google engineer James Damore wrote an impolitic memo criticizing the way diversity is handled at Google. He said there are scientific reasons why Google’s diversity initiatives aren’t working to change Google’s male-female employee ratio. He said clearly that he favors diversity, but thinks that science shows there are more effective ways to achieve it. And he criticized Google for being the kind of place where people who disagree with cultural progressivism cannot speak out.
This got him fired. It also energized the mob of left-wing witch hunters, who piled onto Damore for his alleged sexist bigotry. Much of the hysteria had nothing to do with Damore’s actual arguments. It bashed him on identity politics grounds. Never mind that Damore said in the memo that he favors diversity, and that he thinks racism and sexism are real problems. Never mind that he simply complained that the way Google pursues diversity is unfair to men. And never mind that Google provided the internal forum precisely so that its workers can discuss workplace issues. (These three facts, by the way, are
Very few of us outside of the scientific community are in a position to discuss intelligently the science involved in this dispute. True, some scientists have weighed in to say that Damore is on solid scientific ground in his memo (which doesn’t mean it was a wise thing to share, given the cultural politics of the workplace). My guess is that most ordinary people see this case and wonder why it is that we can’t discuss Damore’s actual argument. Why was a guy who agreed with his company’s diversity goal but not with how the company goes about trying to achieve that result fired simply for arguing — based on science! — that there is a better and more just way to achieve that goal?
How does this relate to Lilla’s argument? In this way. James Damore made a reasoned argument in his memo.
Sacramento Bee columnist
Any conservative who read James Damore’s memo recognized at once that he holds fairly conventional liberal views of the world. But even conventional liberal viewpoints are no longer safe.
Damore did not claim women are “biologically unsuited” to work in tech (as, I regret to report,
Then what did he say? In brief, that Google’s efforts to achieve 50-50 parity between male and female programmers were unlikely to succeed because a lot of women simply aren’t interested in science and technology fields.
And why aren’t they interested? Not because they’re “biologically unsuited” but rather because there are biological differences that lead men and women down different paths.
Mind you, Damore doesn’t say he’s against the company’s goals for greater gender diversity; he simply argues that the executives are going about it the wrong way.
And that is still enough to get him fired. Why? Because of the left’s identity politics, which keeps expanding the boundaries of things you cannot say, even if you can demonstrate that they’re true, or might well be true. So, when Lilla says that “the politics of identity has done nothing but strengthen the grip of the American right on our institutions,” the Damore debacle provides him with a great example.
In her
And that, she said, is what’s at the core of James Damore’s argument: not that women are biologically unable to do tech work, but that the kind of detailed work tech personnel at Google do disproportionately attracts males — and that is bound to affect diversity efforts. Yet McArdle says that even if you concede Damore’s point, it’s still probably the case that a lopsided workplace culture can be an unfriendly place for women — and this is a problem.
She ends like this:
And yet, you still have to ask whether shamestorming Damore and getting him sacked was really the best way to convince him — or anyone else — that he’s mistaken. Did anyone’s understanding of the complex quandaries of gender diversity advance? If there were guys at Google wondering whether the women around them really deserved their jobs, did anyone wake up the morning after Damore’s firing with the revelation: “Good God, how could I have been so blind?” No, I suspect those guys are now thinking: “You see? Women can’t handle math or logic.”
The mob reaction did prove that women indeed have some power in tech. But the power to fire people is not why most people get into engineering. Good engineers want to make things. The conversation around Damore’s memo hasn’t made the world a better place, as they say in Silicon Valley. It has just made a lot of people angry.
Yes, and it has probably made a lot of people more likely to vote Republican next time. Mark Lilla can explain why.",unknown,True
0000966,Is President Trump's Immigration Order a 'Muslim Ban'?,"Imagine the following scenario.
A new presidential administration announces that “political turmoil and terrorism” in the Middle East requires new immigration rules.
From now on, visitors, immigrants and refugees from Israel will not be admitted.
With one exception, that is—believers in “minority religions” within the Jewish state (this is, most prominently, Christians and Muslims) will be allowed to enter, because they are being persecuted at home.
Accused of anti-Semitism, the new administration is aghast. How could you even suspect that? Look—Jews from elsewhere in the world are free to enter—even from other countries with large Jewish populations! It’s purely geographic! (With a small humanitarian exception, of course.) No religious test at all, just a desire to keep America safe. Move along, nothing to see.
Are you buying it so far?
Okay, what if we throw in these additional facts:
The new president ran for office on a pledge to bar Jews from entering the United States. And the proclamation makes no mention of Judaism but specifically mentions that one of the problems with immigrants from Israel (except, of course, Christians and Muslims) is that they discriminate against women and look down on other religions.
What if a presidential adviser states that the president asked him to write a ban on Jewish immigrants that would seem legal?
Does “purely geographic” still pass the laugh test?
The constitutionality of Trump’s order shutting down refugee admissions, and barring any immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations, is a complicated question. Immigration is a highly specialized constitutional area. But a constitutional lawyer would first ask: Is this, as the president has claimed, a “geographic” order, targeting certain countries “compromised by terrorism”? Or is it a “religious test,” intentionally singling out one religion for adverse treatment?
The answer can be constitutionally quite important. In order to violate the Constitution’s requirement of “equal protection of the laws,” a government measure must intentionally discriminate on the basis of a given trait. In this case, the question is whether the order intentionally discriminates against Muslims.
Over the years, the courts have developed a set of tests to find “intentional discrimination.” They are necessary because governments often deny any intent to discriminate against a group or on the basis of a trait. (Certainly the administration denies that now.) Lawyers first look at the precise terms of a government regulation; then they look at its structure and exceptions; then they look at statements made by decision-makers; then they look at the events and procedures surrounding its adoption.
The executive order fails every one of these tests. This is a religious “classification” that intentionally discriminates against Muslims—because of hostility to their religion.
These facts of my hypothetical precisely match Trump’s order. The order states as a reason for its restrictions a desire to exclude “those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including ‘honor’ killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own).” Though “honor killings” is not linked to any religion, its inclusion here is a dog whistle, because the term has been used by Islamophobes who claim (falsely) that it characterizes Muslim society generally.
""The order also allows immigration officials to continue to admit refugees--including refugees from the seven predominantly Muslim countries otherwise banned––on a “case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest—including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution.”

Anti-Muslim discrimination (and hate crimes) are very much a part of recent American history. The specific events leading up to the surprise order were not just unusual but bizarre. Press reports indicate that the officials responsible for refugee policy (e.g., the secretary of homeland security, Gen. John Kelly
The fact that it does not exclude all Muslim immigrants doesn’t make it “neutral.” A rule barring Jews, but not others, from only one place still discriminates against Jews. Discrimination does not disappear simply because it is partial. The test is the intention, and the evidence of intent is plentiful here.
Whether it’s legal, and constitutional, is a different question. But let’s not confuse ourselves:
Yes, it’s a “Muslim ban.”

0000968,‘California better hold on tight!’ – ICE director slams ‘sanctuary state’ law,"Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan slammed California for its “sanctuary city” policies that went into effect Jan. 1.
“Well look, if he thinks he’s protecting the immigrant community, he’s doing quite the opposite, because if you think ICE is going away, we’re not,” Homan said of California Gov. Jerry Brown.
“There’s no sanctuary from federal law enforcement, as a matter of fact, we’re in the process now. I’m going to significantly increase our enforcement presence in California,” he explained. “We’re already doing it. We’re going to detail additional enforcement assets to California.”
“California better hold on tight — they’re about to see a lot more special agents,” he added. “A lot more deportation orders in the state of California.”
“If the politicians in California don’t want to protect their communities, then ICE will.”
Homan went on to claim that the “street cops” in California are completely against the sanctuary state law, and offered an example of an illegal immigrant that committed murder after a city ignored a detention request from ICE.
“We’re gonna be all over the place, and we’re going to enforce the law without apology,” he continued.
“What I’m also doing is working with the Department of Justice — with these sanctuary cities that knowingly shield and harbor an illegal alien in their jail and don’t allow us access,” he added. Tthat is in my opinion, of 8 USC 1314, that’s an alien smuggling statute. I’ve asked the Department of Justice to look at this.”

0000969,President Trump applauds son's 'transparency',"Trump Jr. allowed Tuesday night in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel that ""he has probably met with other people from Russia"" but insisted that he did not attempt to coordinate to impact the election or try to damage Hillary Clinton.
He repeatedly suggested that the charges of collusion were ""ridiculous"" and ""overplayed"" and insisted that his father knew nothing about the June 2016 meeting.
""It was such a nothing there was nothing to tell"" his father, said Trump Jr.
Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father's campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton, according to the emails.
The
President Donald Trump says his eldest son is ""a high-quality person,"" and he applauds ""his transparency.""
In a tweet Tuesday night, the president promoted his son's appearance on Fox News and called him a ""great person who loves our country.""
My son, Donald, will be interviewed by
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a brief statement from the president Tuesday in response to revelations that Trump Jr. agreed to hear damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's effort to help his father.
Trump Jr., who was deeply involved in his father's presidential campaign, released the emails along with a statement describing the disclosure as an effort ""to be totally transparent."" The emails with publicist Rob Goldstone show that Trump Jr. was told that the Russian government had information that could ""incriminate"" Clinton and her dealings with Russia.
Here's my statement and the full email chain
The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said sought to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. As congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, investigate, the emails will almost certainly be reviewed for any signs of potential campaign collusion with the Kremlin, which the White House has repeatedly denied.
Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the emails, citing the ongoing investigation.
Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints).
In the emails, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that the information ""would be very useful to your father."" Goldstone was working to connect Trump Jr. to Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who later met with Trump Jr. in New York at Trump Tower.
Veselnitskaya has denied that she ever worked for the Russian government and said on Tuesday that she doesn't represent the Russian government, only herself. She also said she ""couldn't have had"" information on Hillary Clinton.
""If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,"" Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges the younger Trump posted to Twitter.
The emails, dated early June, show Goldstone telling Trump that singer Emin Agalarov and his father, Moscow-based developer Aras Agalarov, had ""helped along"" the Russian government's support for Trump. The elder Agalarov was involved with Trump in hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. The two men also had preliminary discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow that fell through. Trump also appeared in a music video with the younger Agalarov.
Goldstone at one point said he could send the information to Trump's father first directly ""via Rhona,"" an apparent reference to the elder Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff.
The email release followed days of evolving accounts from Trump Jr. about the nature of the meeting and its purpose. The president's son posted the emails only after they were obtained by The New York Times.
On Saturday, Trump Jr. described the encounter as being a ""short introductory meeting"" focused on the disbanded program that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended the adoptions in response to Magnitsky Act sanctions created in response to alleged human rights violations in Russia.
A day later, Trump Jr. changed his account, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information ""helpful"" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton.
In his third description of what occurred, on Tuesday, Trump Jr. said he had believed the information he would hear about Clinton would be political opposition research. He said that he first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didn't work out, he was told that the attorney would be in New York ""and I decided to take the meeting.""
""The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official,"" Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. ""And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.""
The Trump Organization has confirmed the authenticity of Trump Jr. posts on Twitter releasing the email chain.

It should be noted that the 19% figure is based on known illegals in federal prison - while 58,766 individuals are ""known or suspected"" to be illegal. If we apply the 94% confirmed illegal rate to the ""known or suspected"" population, it brings the total number of potential incarcerated illegal immigrants to 55,240 - or 30% of federal incarcerations.
The report also points out that the federal prison population is roughly 10%, with state and local facilities containing the vast majority of incarcerated individuals in the U.S.

(c) the immigration status of all convicted aliens incarcerated in State prisons and local detention centers throughout the United States.

boasted on Facebook about how ‘Russiagate,’ would not exist if it weren’t for her husband.
A Tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the now-famous dossier suggests that central elements of the Russiagate scandal emerged not from the British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s top-secret “sources” in the Russian government—which are unlikely to exist separate from Russian government control—but from a series of stories that Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby co-wrote for TheWall Street Journal well before Fusion GPS existed, and Donald Trump was simply another loud-mouthed Manhattan real estate millionaire. Understanding the origins of the “Steele dossier” is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the United States.
...
In a Facebook post from June 24, 2017, that Tablet has seen in screenshots, Jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion’s share of credit for Russiagate. (She has not replied to repeated requests for comment.)
“It’s come to my attention that some people still don’t realize what Glenn’s role was in exposing Putin’s control of Donald Trump,” Jacoby wrote. “Let’s be clear. Glenn conducted the investigation. Glenn hired Chris Steele. Chris Steele worked for Glenn.”
This assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride; it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the “Steele dossier,” on which the Russiagate narrative is founded.
According to Fox News reporter Jake Gibson, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called on a senior Justice Department attorney to look into appointing a special counsel to investigate recently demoted official Bruce Ohr’s contacts with Fusion GPS.
“Sessions on calls for a special counsel to look into Sr DOJ Official Bruce Ohr, and wife Nellie’s contacts with Fusion GPS during the summer and fall of 2016: I’ve put a Senior Attorney, with the resources he may need, to review cases in our office and make a recommendation to me, if things aren’t being pursued that need to be pursued, if cases may need more resources to complete in a proper manner, and to recommend to me if the standards for a special counsel are met, and the recommended one should be established,” tweeted Fox News reporter Jake Gibson on Tuesday.
Fox News‘ James Rosen and Jake Gibson recently reported the wife of Justice Department official Bruce G. Ohr worked for the opposition research firm during the 2016 presidential election.
Contacted by Fox News, investigators for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) confirmed that Nellie H. Ohr, wife of the demoted official, Bruce G. Ohr, worked for the opposition research firm last year. The precise nature of Mrs. Ohr’s duties – including whether she worked on the dossier – remains unclear but a review of her published works available online reveals Mrs. Ohr has written extensively on Russia-related subjects.

0000976,How Trump Has Influenced Prevention Of Harriet Tubman’s Image On $20 Bill,"Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary; recently said that he wouldn’t commit to executing the Obama administration’s agenda to feature Harriet Tubman’s image on the $20 bill. He claimed that he hadn’t yet decided on a cause of action on the matter.
Mnuchin added that the decision would be more focused on how to design the $20 currency in a manner that prevents counterfeiting, than whose image is on the bill.
“Eventually we will be looking into this issue,” Mnuchin stated. “It isn’t something I am focused on currently.”
Mnuchin went saying “the issues of why we should change it will be mainly related to what we have to do for the security reasons.”
Last year, President Barack Obama and Jacob Lew, the Treasury Secretary of that time—proposed to take the image of President Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill and then replace it with that of Harriet Tubman.
Tubman is a famous abolitionist who assisted many enslaved people to escape. If everything goes as planned; Tubman would be the first Black-American and the first female to appear on U.S. currency, in more than a century. (Martha Washington was featured on silver certificates back in the late 19th century.)
Lew’s plan explained that Tubman’s image would be placed on the front side of the $20 bill. And then that of Jackson would appear on the opposite of the currency.
The America’s treasury department had earlier made an announcement that seemed to convince that they were ready to put Harriet Tubman portrait on the front of the $20 currency.
However, President Donald Trump has made it clear that he is very fond of Jackson. He said it at times when he was remarking that his election was reminiscent of the populist campaign of 1829 that ascended Jackson into power. Trump even has an image of Jackson on the wall—in the Oval Office.
In the last year interview with NBC, President Trump said that although Tubman was “fantastic,” putting her on the $20 currency was exemplifying “pure political incorrectness.”
“Well. Andrew Jackson had an incredible history, and I think it is very harsh when you take somebody one off, the bill,” said Trump. “I think Tubman is fantastic as well, but I would love us to leave Andrew Jackson or figure out if we can maybe find another denomination.”

0000977,Report: Samantha Power made 260 requests last year to “unmask” Americans in intel reports,"That’s … a lotta unmasking. The fact that Samantha Power is at the heart of the “unmasking” investigation in the House barely qualifies as news at this point, as her name has been floating around in connection with it
“Unmasking is not a regular occurrence—absolutely not a weekly habit. It is rare, even at the National Security Council, and ought to be rarer still for a U.N. ambassador,” according to one former senior U.S. official who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon.
Well, it wasn’t a weekly habit for Power, if
Samantha Power, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was ‘unmasking’ at such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016 – and even sought information in the days leading up to President Trump’s inauguration, multiple sources close to the matter told Fox News.
Two sources, who were not authorized to speak on the record, said the requests to identify Americans whose names surfaced in foreign intelligence reporting, known as unmasking, exceeded 260 last year. One source indicated this occurred in the final days of the Obama White House.
When asked for comment, Power’s spokesman noted that she wasn’t just the ambassador to the UN, she was a member of the National Security Council. But so what? Note again what the senior official told the Free Beacon — even at the NSC, unmasking is rare. The Council also includes the head of OMB and the head of the National Economic Council, incidentally. Should Mick Mulvaney and Gary Cohn be unmasking American citizens in intelligence reports at will just because they’re members?
Here’s an easy way to gauge whether Power’s practices were appropriate: How did her volume of unmasking requests stack up to Susan Rice’s and John Brennan’s? Rice was national security advisor, Brennan was head of the CIA. If anyone in the Obama administration had reason to be unmasking U.S. citizens for valid intelligence purposes, it was them. You’d certainly expect Brennan to have made more unmasking requests than someone more peripheral to the intelligence process, like Power. So let’s know the numbers. How many unmasking requests per week on average were Rice and Brennan filing compared to her?
Another question: How many of Power’s requests were actually granted? An official can ask to have the redacted name of an American in an intelligence report revealed but it’s up to the FBI and NSA to grant that request. And they don’t do it lightly, as Fox notes:
“We [the NSA] apply two criteria in response to their request: number one, you must make the request in writing. Number two, the request must be made on the basis of your official duties, not the fact that you just find this report really interesting and you’re just curious,” [Mike Rogers] said in June. “It has to tie to your job and finally, I said two but there’s a third criteria, and is the basis of the request must be that you need this identity to understand the intelligence you’re reading.”
What was a UN ambassador doing in her “official duties” that required her to know the identities of so many Americans who turned up in intelligence reports? If it turns out she did in fact “just find this report really interesting” and was “just curious” and the NSA or FBI *granted* unmasking requests made along those lines then this scandal will blow up far beyond Power herself. A lone official trying to go rogue on intelligence by making a ridiculous number of unmasking requests is one thing. The FBI and NSA abetting her by granting those requests and outing Americans to someone who may have had no legitimate intelligence purpose in knowing who they are is another thing entirely. *If* that’s what happened here, Comey and Rogers will become the center of the probe, not Power. Why were their agencies not more exacting in demanding proper justification for unmasking, investigators will wonder, particularly given the alarming number of requests from Power and the fact that her job didn’t obviously require her to have this information?
One point in Power’s defense, though. What are the odds that she would be allowed to go on making hundreds of improper unmasking requests without it leaking and with no one stopping her? If the FBI and NSA were rejecting her applications daily, you would think someone would have stepped in at some point and either told her to cool it or whispered to the papers that she was abusing the process. And if the FBI and NSA were granting most of her applications, it’s hard to believe they were so systematically crooked that they would risk their institutional reputations and a major scandal to rubber-stamp requests made by a figure as tangential to the natsec process as Power. This wasn’t Brennan or James Clapper demanding the information, it was a diplomat who spent most of her tenure impotently defending Obama’s impotent Syria policy. Would Comey and Rogers gamble their careers by looking the other way at improper applications made by her for months on end?
Maybe Power had reason to suspect there were Americans working at the UN, maybe even on her own staff, who were quietly double-dealing with foreign powers in the building? That would be a legitimate intelligence purpose for unmasking, but why the UN ambassador would be left to make those requests instead of Brennan or Rice, I have no idea. American double agents at the UN would be a big deal, worthy of attention from the big cheeses of natsec.",unknown,True
0000978,Sadly the NY Times is back to questioning the value of free speech,"One month ago I
Today, I’m sorry to say, the NY Times has slipped back into quite literally questioning the value of free speech. An op-ed by Professor Aaron Hanlon suggests speeches by conservatives
In a typical year, the University of California, Berkeley, allocates around $200,000 to pay for security at campus protests. But since this past February, the school has spent some
And it raises a thorny question for those who believe that free speech should trump all else: Should public institutions be spending taxpayer money allocated for higher education on speakers who aren’t there for teaching and learning?
Hanlon is correct that an absurd amount of money is being spent on security, though it’s worth noting that
Undoubtedly, left-wing “antifa” groups have contributed to the security risks and costs at Berkeley, taking the bait that speakers like Mr. Yiannopoulos lay out and
To say that Antifa has “contributed” to costs at Berkeley could be the understatement of the year. When Antifa shut down a previous speech by Yiannopoulos in February members of the group beat several people and did
When Ben Shapiro came to Berkeley earlier this month, the school felt it necessary to
The bland reference to “historian Mark Bray” suggests Hanlon isn’t being remotely honest with his audience. Bray isn’t just a historian – he’s a far left former Occupy spokesman who is now the single most prominent defender of Antifa’s violence in the public sphere. Maybe that’s worth mentioning when using him as an expert on Antifa.
But the most offensive thing here is the idea that Antifa is merely a “symptom.” This is an attempt to get violent kooks off the hook for their own inexcusable behavior. Hanlon does this by bringing up the historical reaction to the Nazis. But do Nazis explain the surge of
Getting back to Berkeley, the amount of money spent to keep speakers safe is a proportionate response to the threat of left-wing violence. How do we know? Because in its response to a lawsuit brought against the school by the college Republicans this is the exact argument
The email explained that UCPD had, based on a “comprehensive review of potential sites and security arrangements,” “determined that, given currently active security threats, it is not possible to assure that the event could be held successfully—or that the safety of Ms. Coulter, the event sponsors, audience, and bystanders could be adequately protected—at any of the campus venues available on April 27th.”…
Plaintiffs contend that Defendants enforced the “unwritten, High-Profile Speaker Policy against YAF and BCR,” while allowing Vicente Fox Quesada, the former president of Mexico, to speak on campus at 4:00 p.m. on April 17, 2017, and Maria Echaveste to speak on campus from 6:45 to 8:00 p.m. “without incident or interference from Defendants.” (Id. ¶¶ 78-79, 91.) Plaintiffs do not allege any threats to security accompanying the speeches of Mr. Fox or Ms. Echaveste.
In other words, there weren’t any right-wing mobs looking to shut down or shout down left-wing speakers. There were credible threats (and recent history) of mob action by the left against right-wing speakers. This is what you call a clue! Professor Hanlon seems to have missed it.
Finally, the suggestion that Hanlon makes that Ben Shapiro is somehow a representative of the threat of white supremacist violence is absurd. He is a Jewish conservative who has been a frequent (in fact, the most frequent) target of alt-right anger over the past year. And yet, there were credible threats he would be shut down if not for the extensive preparations by law enforcement.
The cost of protecting conservative speakers on campus is far too high, while the cost of protecting progressive speakers is minimal. The solution to this problem is not to suggest schools should give up trying but to demand that the people making the threats stop making them. It’s a shame so many contributors to the NY Times can’t seem to get that.",unknown,True

0000980,“Outraged Democrats” don’t even wait 8 hours before calling for more gun control,"Well, this was sadly predictable, even when the day started with a lot of people calling on their fellow citizens to not jump into politicizing the Las Vegas shooting while the injured were still being tended to.
The worst mass shooting in modern American history was met with immediate calls for action on gun control Monday from some Democratic lawmakers.
While most of their colleagues on both sides of the aisle stuck to sending condolences to victims and their families in the Las Vegas shooting, Connecticut’s senators expressed outrage that Congress has not done more to restrict access to deadly firearms five years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown.
“Nowhere but America do horrific large-scale mass shootings happen with this degree of regularity,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a statement.
“This must stop,” Murphy continued. “It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren’t public policy responses to this epidemic. There are, and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference. It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.”
Murphy was joined by his Connecticut partners, Senator Richard Blumenthal and Congressman Jim Himes. Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren quickly got in on the act as well.
Okay, then. Fine. Since we apparently have to go through this exercise every time there’s a tragedy, let’s talk about it. Right out of the gate I would ask these Democrats the same questions we need to wrestle with after every shooting. First of all, what went wrong in this instance and what specific laws would you like to suggest which might have prevented it and will hopefully prevent something like this from happening again in the future?
Thus far we don’t have much in the way of rock solid details as to what weapons the shooter used. Allahpundit laid out pretty much all the possibilities
Let’s say it’s the most obvious choice based on the sounds we heard in the many witness videos… one or more fully automatic machine guns of some sort. If that’s the case, the shooter either purchased it legally prior to 1986 or he obtained it illegally by stealing it or buying it on the black market. If the former, then he passed one of the most rigorous federal background checks imaginable and was already on the radar of the FBI just for owning the weapon or weapons. He was also pretty well off since they would have cost him upwards of $10K each. (Though he had two really nice cars, so maybe he could afford it.) That means that someone who passed those most brutal of background checks went off the rails, became insane or developed some other issues later in life. What law would you propose to prevent that?
Perhaps he stole them or bought them on the black market. Then no amount of background checks in the world would have stopped this because people dealing in illegal weapons don’t do background checks.
Perhaps, as Allahpundit speculated, he had a brace of ten or more AR-15 style semiautomatics which he modified. Well, modifying them in that fashion is illegal already. If you’d like to suggest tougher penalties for people who do that, I suppose I can get onboard with the idea, but somehow it doesn’t seem like it would have stopped this guy. If your solution is to once again ask to ban all of the millions of legal owners of semiautomatic rifles from owning them in response to someone who broke the law by modifying them you’re not solving a problem, you’re creating a bigger one.
Beyond that what would you suggest? Smaller magazine capacities? (Nevada doesn’t have a very restrictive limit.) The guy had ten or more rifles lined up by the window. And anyone with a day or so of practice can swap out a magazine in under three seconds. You might have slowed him down a fraction, but not much.
That’s all I’ve come up with. So, dear Outraged Democrats, let me know if you’ve thought of something else. If your plan is to simply repeal the Second Amendment, bring that fight on. But I do have one actual solution you never seem to want to talk about. If, as it’s not unreasonable to suspect, the shooter got his guns illegally, why don’t you consider new or enhanced laws and more resources to crack down on the illegal gun market? Rather than chasing around and harassing the hundreds of millions of legal gun owners who don’t commit acts of violence, unleash the power of the legislature and law enforcement on improved ways to get illegal guns off the streets and lock up the people using or dealing in them for longer periods of time.

0000981,Justice Department jamming shut the revolving door for illegal aliens,"One of the running complaints raised against opponents of border security is the proliferation of criminal illegal aliens who enter the United States repeatedly, are apprehended and then sent back to their home countries. That part of the formula would be fine were it not for the fact that so many of them keep crossing the border multiple times, only to be found committing additional crimes. In some of the worst cases, you wind up with a result along the lines of the murder of Kate Steinle. But less high profile situations clog the system on a regular basis.
This year that destructive pattern has finally begun to change, albeit slowly. With new laws on the books and a more aggressive Attorney General, prosecutions are on the rise and sentences are at least somewhat more appropriate for the perpetrators. One such case came through this week in Louisiana, where Juan Carlos Rigoberto-Martinez had been caught in the country illegally multiple times after committing multiple crimes. The citizen of Honduras encountered a different sort of reception this time and found himself in federal court where he was
BATON ROUGE, LA – Acting United States Attorney Corey Amundson announced that yesterday U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles sentenced JUAN CARLOS RIGOBERTO-MARTINEZ, age 33, of Honduras, to serve 130 months in federal prison for illegally reentering the United States after removal. The defendant’s extensive criminal history, including his status as an aggravated felon, contributed significantly to the lengthy sentence.
Yesterday’s sentence stems from the defendant’s federal conviction on April 12, 2017, for illegally reentering the United States after removal. Immigration authorities first removed the defendant from the United States on January 7, 2008, after he completed a state prison sentence in Georgia for burglary and theft.
Several months later, on June 5, 2008, the U.S. Border Patrol found and arrested the defendant in Texas for illegally reentering the United States after removal. The defendant plead guilty to the offense, resulting in a 77-month federal prison sentence from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. On December 27, 2013, immigration authorities again removed the defendant from the United States following the completion of his prison term.
This is an encouraging development which will hopefully send a strong message to the illegal alien community. Too often in the past we’ve seen illegals who have been deported as many as seven times being brought in on charges and we essentially focus on the new crimes they have committed. If those are sufficiently “minor” in nature they are frequently given yet another free ride back to their homeland and the cycle begins anew.
Not so with Rigoberto-Martinez. He had done a short stretch in prison in Georgia for burglary in 2008 when he was deported back to Honduras. In a matter of months he was back in the United States illegally once again. This time he was arrested for multiple robberies in Baton Rouge. He was already found guilty on those counts, but this time there was a difference. In a separate trial, he was found guilty exclusively of reentering the country illegally after having been deported as a criminal illegal alien. That was the charge he was sent up on rather than the robberies. (For which he will serve a shorter, concurrent sentence.)
Even if all Rigoberto-Martinez had been convicted of was petty theft of a pack of gum at a convenience store, he could have been locked away for a good, long stretch for illegal reentry. It’s obvious that our prison system doesn’t need to be further strained with a deluge of these criminals, but the less welcoming of a place we make America for criminal illegal aliens, the lower the incentive will be to jump the fence and come here. The sentencing of Rigoberto-Martinez goes at least some way towards driving that message home among the illegal alien community.
Now if we can just make the E-Verify system mandatory across the board to decrease the incentive for illegal aliens looking to take paying jobs rather than stick-up jobs we might really have something going. But don’t get your hopes up, since that would involve Congress actually doing their jobs.",unknown,True
0000982,"Law prof: There’s still a way Hillary Clinton could become president this year, you know","On the one hand, I want to mock this as preposterous fanfic coughed up by a “Resistance” movement that still hasn’t managed to choke down the fact of Trump’s victory.
On the other hand, everyone’s entitled to their own taste in porn. For some lefties, a constitutional deus ex machina in which the queen is magically restored to her rightful throne is it.
The law prof behind this,
If number 1: If Trump is definitively found to have colluded directly with Russia, he would be forced to resign or be impeached.
If number 2: If Trump is removed, Vice President Mike Pence would become president.
If number 3: If Pence becomes president, he should resign too, given that he benefited from the same help from Mother Russia.
If number 4: If Pence resigns before appointing a vice president, Ryan would become president.
If number 5: If Ryan becomes president, he should do the right thing and choose Clinton for vice president. Then he should resign.
Actually, there’s a sixth step in Lessig’s piece: In a gesture of goodwill, President Hillary should then appoint Ryan (or some other Republican) as her VP. Imagine the Clinton/Ryan ticket trying to work through disagreements on, say, entitlements and federal spending.
Jay Cost made a good point about this last night. Even if you’ve convinced yourself that there’s a chance in hell of Trump *and* Pence both being removed by the Senate due to collusion with Russia, why would you seize on some convoluted “Ryan names Hillary VP and then resigns” fantasy to get her into the Oval Office? There’s a much more straightforward way:
Step one: Democrats win back the House, which isn’t at all unlikely right now.
Step two: Democrats name Hillary Clinton the new Speaker. Pelosi won’t like that, but whatever. The Speaker doesn’t need to be a member of the House.
Step three: The House impeaches Trump and Pence.
Step four: The Senate removes Trump and Pence, clearing the way for — ta da — Speaker Clinton to become president via established rules of succession.
That fourth step’s a doozy, though, huh? Due to the fact that the most vulnerable senators up for reelection next fall are almost all Democrats, even the most optimistic Dems think the best-case scenario in the midterms is winning a *bare* majority in the Senate. That would require holding all vulnerable Democratic seats, knocking off Dean Heller and Jeff Flake, and then pulling a major red-state upset somewhere. Do all that — an inside straight electorally — and you’ve got 51. In which case Schumer would still need no fewer than 16 Republicans to vote for removing Trump (and Pence). Unless Mueller produces video of Putin handing Trump a fat envelope, he’ll never get it. And even then, half the party would argue that we can’t know exactly what was in the envelope. Maybe it was a Hallmark card offering the United States a reset.
I have no big ending to this post, so in lieu of an exit question, enjoy Rand Paul dumping all over John McCain and Lindsey Graham.

0000983,Made in America: Buy or Not to Buy?,"Are you ok with supporting sweatshop labor?
Are you ok with knowing your cheaper product made somewhere else could be causing suffering to another family?
Are we killing our jobs, economy, and business?
Over my lifetime, I have continually heard my family and friends complain ""everything is made in China."" In many ways, until I started working and understood just how some businesses work, I had no clue about how imports could undercut prices in this country. Most everyone usually has a problem with this concept; China manufacturers in massive numbers whereas, America produces only smaller and more accurate parts and products. Furthermore, the mass production allows for decreased prices.
Think of every single product you have purchased in the last few months, look at the back or wherever the label is and find the origin. Chances are, your parts and products have not been manufactured in the same country. Instead, a variety of supplies will be imported from different locations then shipped into a plant to finish production. For example, the new administration put forth ""buy American, hire American"" to help existing businesses and start up businesses produce and distribute these within their local and even national community.
Many times, even products and parts claiming to be made in America have been found to be nothing but a fraud, they purchase the steel, ingredients, etc. in America but then, ship these things to another country to be put together or made and then sent back to this country. For example, I use to work for Highland Industries, Inc in Kernersville, NC a few years back, they manufactured the raw rubber for Nascar, GM, Ford, Nissan and so on as well as the seat belt division located in another state.
I drove a forklift and kept an inventory duel role. We made the rubber at the plant, hired a trucking company to come from Laredo, Texas to drive all the way to NC to pick up a load and then drive back and enter Mexico to get the rubber put on the tires as well as the seat belt material was cut and sewn. This material was then shipped back to the states to be sold to the auto industry/parts to them or to the customers.
Now, we must consider what brings up the current ""buy American"" has lost its value since NAFTA took effect; manufacturing virtually went away during this unfair exchange of labor and allowing basically slave labor/sweatshops to cut jobs primarily hurting everyone in the process. Why does it hurt cheaper labor/sweatshops? Consider the situation. While we may receive lower prices overall and the business usually makes a significant profit, the ones doing the work are not getting a fair wage and often are put in adverse working conditions and extremely long working hours.
So, it must be better actually to buy American right? The answer may surprise you. Currently, my wife and I own a small business making whole body products such as soaps, shampoos, laundry detergent, etc.mostly, our products are mostly made in America.
What does that necessarily equate to? Here's the answer, we purchase our bases, the blocks of material that we cut off smaller portions, weigh them, melt it and put it into a pour spout cup, mix up the fragrances and put them into 8, 16, 32 oz bottles of shampoo, deodorant bottles or soap molds. We can purchase the bases from other American owned companies cheaper here, the fragrances here, most shipping supplies but believe it or not, Ali Express in China can produce better and more inexpensive bottles, lids and some other products because, in America, these items are generally one to two dollars more expensive.
These companies once they are called and asked where they are getting their bulk supplies usually tell you they get them overseas and usually end the conversation. In most of my phone calls initially, when the company started up, most of these wholesalers told me they got them from Ali Express. This usually ends up cutting out the ""middle man"" as it were and if you are a business, you can contact this company and purchase directly and save a lot of money.
Often we now hear about buying local, I have found out that many of these same people that make a claim, will not buy local but will rather go online and purchase from Amazon or some major retailer for a lower price and even pay more for shipping than driving to the brick and mortar store. As a small business owner, I can fully understand the need to save money and do other things with it, but at the same time, our country cannot continue to keep on with the mentality that our products are worth a lot more than they are. American's can and should make our parts and products again to bring down prices, the only reason things cost more money for our country and businesses is that companies pay out larger portions of labor fees to their employees.
The mentality that we all must have a 15 dollar and an hour wage will drive prices through the roof and put these same people demanding the pay out of work or cut down considerably. We must, as a country, require our manufacturing start producing and take back the products that are currently being made in China but people demand low prices on every product regardless of what the part or product is. This mentality coupled with the ""entitled"" generation will cause great problems in these areas, children growing up think they have the right to an education, excellent wages for minimum skills and countless other things. They are being told that we shouldn't be making our products and mock most people doing things for themselves such as the business that my wife and I produce in our spare time.
I cannot stand the fact that I must purchase from China on my product bottles, deodorant, and even chapstick tubes to save money and hopefully start employing people. If another company in America would produce the same products at the same price or barely a little more expensive, I would switch. Still, to continue having a competitive edge, something has to give.
Maybe I have given others something to think about but just remember, before NAFTA was put in place, we produced most of our furniture but sadly has dwindled to almost nothing now. My mother worked at the Basset Furniture in Mt. Airy, NC for nearly 20 years putting in runners in drawers before things started going away. To continue surviving in our country again, we must all demand and purchase actually companies that are mostly/are made in America to bring back our economy and support ourselves/friends.
This may sound a little political, but it’s the truth, you cannot demand to buy local when you don't actually buy local, to begin with, and demand the company lose money to sell it to you cheaper. My advice, find America owned companies, ask them if they make their products here, and should they confirm this, remember just because it's more reasonable from somewhere else does not mean it is made well. Quantity and quality are two different spheres. Some products such as the Apple iPhone and others are manufactured in another country produced by sweatshop workers that live in dangerous working conditions and terrible wages.It's time to start thinking more about the product and what it supports than that lower price, did you know that
Another important aspect to consider when delving into the shopping and purchasing products involves the meaning of ""Cruelty-Free."" For many years, America prohibited the practices of animal testing. In fact, many believe this to be a standard in American production and manufacturing still. What few realize is the time limit placed on animal experiments has expired. Now, many companies, especially within the makeup industry, have once again returned to this horrible practice. For example:
Do all test their products on animals? Please look up these companies and do more than getting angry about it or if you don't know, then you need to, buying these products don't help Americans and kill, and injured animals every year.
The challenge is recognizing how we all either can support and begin to make personal changes to impact the direction of the safety of our products. It also reminds us to identify the need to accept responsibility by how our decisions may affect not only others but also animals as well. Move forward with purpose!

0000984,Tooth Regeneration Must Prevail!,"Science and technology are both evolving rapidly. Often they are both evolving so rapidly that even the savviest people have a difficult time keeping abreast of all the latest developments in each area of science and technology. Not too long ago, my sister had a conversation with me about computer technology, and she made the point that a computer that you buy from a store becomes obsolete by the time that you remove it from its box and get it running. Nevertheless, certain items continue to remain in existence despite that one would think that they would be obsolete by now, and usually it is because of popular demand. Take the example of the manual typewriter. Authors all have their own preferences on how they wish to compose their literary works. When I was watching the movie titled The Magic of Belle Isle in which Morgan Freeman played the role of an author, there was a scene in that movie in which he stressed that he preferred a manual typewriter because of the feeling that he got from using it. He added that he also liked the sound of it. Interestingly enough, nobody ever has to go on a wild goose chase to find a replacement part for a typewriter, manual or electric, whenever it is on the fritz and they have to take it somewhere to get it fixed. On the other hand, authors who use computers are always confronted with the dreaded fate of their computer running into software and hardware problems after replacement parts that they later need for it have stopped being manufactured. Certain photographers will stress that pictures just don’t look natural unless they are taken with a camera that uses real film rather than digital technology.
I remember back in the 1990s right after I had been in the Northridge earthquake out in California, I became concerned about whether my records had been damaged. However, when I asked all my relatives nearby if I could use their record players to check them for scratches, they told me that they were out of order and that they didn’t know where I could buy one either. Unfortunately, I did not own a record player at the time. When I had initially bought these records, I had used my parents’ record player to play them. However, because my parents were living clear back on the East Coast, I no longer had that option after I had moved out to California. Anyhow, I phoned just about every store in West Los Angeles and Santa Monica that I could think of to ask whether they sold record players, and they all told me that they no longer did so inasmuch as everyone was buying CDs by then and almost nobody was selling regular vinyl records. Ironically, not too many years later, record players began appearing in sales magazines that I received in the mail, and eventually regular stores began selling them again because of the popular demand for them. Then, shortly thereafter, vinyl records began making a comeback to the market. By the way, I eventually checked my records for scratches after I was eventually able to buy a record player of my own that allowed me to listen to them, and it turned out that the earthquake had not damaged them in any manner.
Manual typewriters, regular camera film, vinyl records, and record players all four have become such a regular part of American pop culture that not even the rapid evolution of science and technology will ever completely phase them out. Americans have grown too attached to these items, because they have a certain charm about them. On the other hand, whenever anyone hears the mention of dentures or any kind of prosthetic teeth, angry faces appear everywhere. The fact of the matter is that most people hate the idea of having such phony baloney materials in their mouth at all times. Most people feel that dentures and false teeth are completely below them, because they are unattractive and they are often associated with getting old. Then again, most elderly individuals would prefer to have their own natural teeth than a mouth full of false teeth.
Dentures and false teeth are just not really anybody’s cup of tea. They’re expensive, and they’re a pain in the neck to have in your mouth. Dental implants may seem closer in appearance to natural teeth, but they are still expensive and they involve a certain degree of unwanted risks. Fillings, crowns, caps, and bridges may not get as many dirty looks from the public at large, but the high costs of having them placed in your mouth still makes them not so popular. Then many of us ask ourselves why do these abominations of dentistry continue to exist if computer technology is evolving too rapidly for people to keep up with it. Shouldn’t dental technology be evolving just as quickly as computer technology?
The Microsoft Corporation had the Windows 8 system on the market for a very short time inasmuch as the Windows 10 system was invented shortly after the Windows 8 system became publicly available. One would think that if computer technology evolves that quickly, even dental floss would have been phased out years ago and we would now be using some kind of small, handheld rod with some kind of sterilization light at the end of it to eliminate plaque from in between our teeth. When you think about it, floss has to be the most primitive item in existence. The irony of it is that dentists will scream their heads off at their patients on how they must use floss or all their teeth are going to fall out. However, I did not begin using dental floss until I was 10 years old, and all my teeth had not fallen out by then, excluding any of my baby teeth. In fact, I don’t remember getting any cavities the year before then. Therefore, it is apparent that the benefits of flossing are so overrated. And please don’t say that I was lucky. I hate that word “lucky,” because it is so unrealistic. It gives me the image in my mind of someone with a ridiculously big grin on their face saying “You’re so lucky!” in a voice that sounds similar to that of Barney the Purple Dinosaur or some cartoon character. Moreover, I have never been lucky at anything throughout my life. I’ve had to work hard for everything that I’ve gotten throughout my life, and I’ve gone up against many odds along the way. In my world, being lucky is an optical illusion altogether. Anyhow, if you don’t believe my point about dental floss, watch the YouTube video below and it will tell you how certain experts agree that using dental floss is virtually futile to oral hygiene. What is interesting about this same video is that one of the experts states that if you use mouthwash, you don’t need to use dental floss. After watching this same video, you won’t feel subconscious about not flossing at night once in a while whenever you’re so tired that you just want to go straight to bed rather than mess with string, which is what dental floss is.
Two years ago when I was temping at a call center and my co-workers and I were in what is called downtime, which is when telephone calls don’t come into a call center for a long period of time, I got into a conversation with a co-worker of mine named India about dental care. During our conversation, I brought up the topic of tooth regeneration. However, despite how intelligent and savvy India was about many things, she told me that she had never heard of tooth regeneration before. I then explained to her exactly what it was. She then asked me whether it was the same thing as dental implants, and I told her that it wasn’t inasmuch as dental implants were still prosthetic teeth whereas tooth regeneration mainly involved the transplant of natural teeth. She then smiled at me and told me that she thought that such a dental procedure seemed like an excellent idea inasmuch as people would prefer to have something real in their mouth rather than something fake. It made me think of that 1968 song by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell titled “Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing.”
There are basically two different types of tooth regeneration that scientists are attempting to make available to the general public through the dental profession. The first type of
The second type of tooth regeneration actually involves growing back a tooth to replace one that has been removed or lost. This procedure entails transplanting some kind of pod into the gums where a tooth is missing and then using stem cells to grow a replacement tooth. Down below are two YouTube videos that describe this same procedure.
Both of the above-described tooth regeneration procedures present themselves as the public’s deliverance from the dreaded indignities of prosthetic teeth. However, there is one problem. Neither of these procedures is yet available to the public. People are currently spending a fortune on fillings, caps, bridges, crowns, dentures, and even dental implants, and it seems that the light at the end of this dreary tunnel of primitive dentistry looks dimmer than most of us may have expected. However, whenever you research tooth regeneration on the Internet, you will notice that scientists have been working fiercely to perfect this dental phenomenon for years, even over the course of the last two decades. I even recall having listened to a car radio twenty years ago and having heard a report on the news that a group of scientists had grown a natural tooth in a laboratory. I remember getting particularly furious when I read an article on the Internet about tooth regeneration back in 2002, and the person who wrote the article had the audacity to say that she didn’t believe that tooth regeneration would become available to the public through the dental profession for another twenty years; and then she had the nerve to preach about how one, therefore, needed to floss their teeth every morning and every night. If I were able to remember the name of that person who wrote that article, I would e-mail her a link to the previously cited YouTube video about the futility of flossing teeth so that she would have the platinum opportunity to eat her own words. Pardon the pun.
People like me who absolutely hate to floss their teeth because of the time and effort involved in it are always interested in knowing the exact date that dentists will begin performing both tooth regeneration procedures on their patients. I even saw a video on YouTube about the future in which the narrator mentioned that tooth regeneration would most likely be available to the public by 2022. However, experts have spoken in different documentaries and news clips as though tooth regeneration could become available to the public any day now. Therefore, here is the question. What is holding up the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures? Here in the second decade of the twenty-first century, fillings, crowns, caps, bridges, dentures, abutments, and dental implants all belong inside a glass-enclosed exhibit in a downtown museum rather than in people’s mouths.
Once you have read the articles to which I have provided you with links herein, you immediately realize that scientists have various hurdles to jump over in making both tooth regeneration procedures available in dental offices throughout the world. It appears that the scientists, including Dr. Mao, who have taken every step to perfect both tooth regeneration procedures and make them safe to perform on humans have done just about everything they can do to make this scientific breakthrough available to everyone. However, there is still this one agency called the United States Food and Drug Administration (“F.D.A.”), and there is obviously other bureaucratic red tape that they have to contend with before both tooth regeneration procedures finally put the dental prosthetics industry out of business once and for all. This is where the politics kick in.
Both tooth regeneration procedures do not involve the use of embryonic stem cells. Therefore, I would have to say that it is safe for me to deduce that Dr. Mao and his colleagues will not get any flak from the Religious Right during their proceedings to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the public at large. Because many evangelicals live in parts of our country where people consume great amounts of Mountain Dew and lose their teeth regularly as a result, I can be fairly sure that even they will welcome both tooth regeneration procedures to the dental profession. However, I don’t think that I can quite say the same thing about the dental prosthetics industry. These people are dead set on protecting their profits and ensuring their sales revenues at whatever cost to the public.
When I was just a little kid, I remember this one news report that I saw on television regarding the milk industry. A group of scientists back then had invented some kind of synthetic milk that was less expensive and supposedly just as healthy as real milk. They planned on using it to make ice cream. There was even a little boy in the news report who sampled the ice cream containing the synthetic milk, and he said that he liked it. When I saw this news story, I was not very happy about it inasmuch as I did not like the idea of synthetic foods and beverages eventually replacing natural foods and beverages. Fortunately, the milk industry ran interference against the owner of this product and eventually kept it from ever seeing the light of day on the market. I was happy about it, and so were many other people inasmuch as very few people obviously liked the idea of putting fake stuff in their body. The milk industry did an important favor for the public at large, because such a synthetic product would have likely marked the beginning of both synthetic and genetically modified foods and beverages (
This news story regarding synthetic milk and the milk industry’s intervention into the prospect of the synthetic milk’s entry into the market to make ice cream was not the first time that I had seen a news story like this one on television or had heard about events like these. Shortly after I had moved to New York City to work in a public sector position, my landlord, Mrs. Palladino, had a telephone conversation with me about insomnia. In that telephone conversation, she told me that she had read a magazine article back in the 1970s that revealed that a sleeping machine had been invented and that this sleeping machine helped people fall asleep quickly and safely. She explained to me that when the pharmaceutical industry got wind of it and realized how detrimental this sleeping machine would be to their sales of sedatives and tranquilizers if it were ever to get on the market, they zeroed in on the situation and purchased the patent to that sleeping machine so that they could stop it from being placed on the market. After Mrs. Palladino told me about this magazine article, I was extremely appalled by it; and I told her that it was not right for these pharmaceutical companies to do something like that inasmuch as sedatives and tranquilizers can be addictive and harmful to people after their prolonged consumption and the sleeping machine would have given people suffering from insomnia a healthy alternative to ingesting chemicals. Mrs. Palladino then explained to me that the only concern that the pharmaceutical companies had in this whole situation was their sales revenues. According to her, they couldn’t have cared less about the rights and the welfare of the consumer.
What immediately comes to mind is a similar conversation between a friend and me that I described in my previous Hub titled “
When I saw the actor Mark Ruffalo appear on an edition of the HBO series Real Time With Bill Maher not too long ago, Mr. Ruffalo stressed to Bill Maher that this reprehensible kind of conduct among corporate moguls was quite common. Now, I have nothing against the free enterprise system, and I am all for the rule of laissez-faire whenever anyone wishes to conduct business here in the United States of America so long as they do not break the law. After all, our country was built on capitalism. However, whenever greedy corporate shysters collectively strive to obstruct the advancement of any kind of science or technology, including dental technology, this is where I feel that either the Federal government or the public at large or both needs to do damage control. In figurative words, no greedy corporate shyster has the right to fly his wife first class to France simply for her to get her hair done at an exclusive beauty salon in Paris at the expense and detriment of everyday people’s health and well-being.
The dental prosthetics market, which includes the sales of dental implants, crowns, bridges, caps, fillings, dentures, and abutments, is
Whether or not anyone can actually prove that this reprehensible type of conduct is going on in the dental prosthetics industry, we still must presume the worst and take action on it inasmuch as it could make a difference between both tooth regeneration procedures being available to the public next year or not being available to the public until the next century. The corporate moguls who own, operate, and profit from the dental prosthetics industry are likely well aware that once both tooth regeneration procedures become fully available to the entire world, the demand for their products is going to plummet rapidly. Never mind any reports or news stories that you see on the Internet about this same industry prospering into a multibillion-dollar industry by 2021. Owners of video stores back in the early part of the twenty-first century all probably thought that they would be living in some plush mansion out in Santa Barbara, California by now, but we all know what happened to that industry after more sophisticated forms of television technology came along such as the DVR and Video-On-Demand. Netflix, Amazon Prime, and even YouTube did not help their situation either after these same three entities came into existence.
At first, people are going to be able to get outrageously good deals on dental implants and other prosthetic dental materials (e.g. fillings, caps, crowns, bridges, and dentures) after both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the public at large. Extensive dental work involving these items will likely become more affordable than it has ever been in the history of our nation. It will have to do so, because the dental prosthetics industry will be standing on its last legs financially by then. The amount of unemployment and underemployment in our nation will maintain a market for this industry, because these prosthetic dental materials will become so cheap that this industry will be desperate to sell them in one way or another; and consumers with limited incomes will be the only ones buying them at that point in time. Of course, if the problem with joblessness in our country diminishes significantly in the near future, then the demand for these bargain prosthetic dental materials will decrease drastically. It’s kind of like the situation back in the late 1980s and the early 1990s in which once CDs became common, record stores began giving outrageously exceptional deals on regular vinyl records inasmuch as fewer people were buying them. Of course, regular vinyl records eventually made a comeback to the market because of their sentimental nature. However, there is nothing sentimental about dentures, false teeth, and prosthetic dental items, and the sales backlash that the dental prosthetics industry will initially experience subsequent to the public availability of tooth regeneration will not last forever. Therefore, once both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the public at large, profits and sales revenues for the companies that manufacture prosthetic dental materials will never be the same again; and eventually this same industry is going to collapse and disappear forever.
Some of you may be questioning how the dental insurance industry is going to respond to the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures. My guess is about as good as yours. It really depends on how expensive such procedures will be. If these two procedures are less expensive than having prosthetic dental materials placed in dental patients’ mouths, then the dental insurance industry will likely see it as more cost-effective for them to insure both tooth regeneration procedures and discontinue insuring any prosthetic-related dental procedures. If the dental insurance industry decides to go down that road, then their actions will further speed up the eventual collapse of the dental prosthetics industry altogether. On the other hand, if dental prosthetics companies immediately begin offering bargain prices on their products, the dental insurance industry may cut them some slack. At least for a while, that is. Unless I could somehow get a hold of what the cost factor would be, I cannot really speculate how the dental insurance industry is going to respond to the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures. However, I can say that if the owners of these dental insurance companies are conscientious about the oral health of their customers, then they could possibly feel more inclined to grant coverage for both tooth regeneration procedures and then eventually deny coverage for any prosthetic-related dental procedure altogether from that point on.
Nevertheless, let’s not get excited just yet about the prospective extinction of dental implants, dentures, and the likes. Greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry are going to run interference any way they can against Dr. Mao and his colleagues from making both tooth regeneration procedures a complete reality for everyone. They will see opportunities to do so in the form of finding creative ways to get the F.D.A. to deny Dr. Mao and his colleagues the approval they need from that Federal government agency to release both tooth regeneration procedures to the dental market. Greedy corporate shysters will pay lawyers exorbitant quantities of money to bring legal actions against Dr. Mao and his colleagues and to contact whatever government agencies they need to do so in order to throw legal roadblocks at Dr. Mao and his colleagues from ever being able to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the dental profession and the public at large. These are the kinds of disgraceful tactics that greedy corporate shysters use to protect their own profits and sales revenues at the expense and detriment of others. These injustices have happened in the past; and they will continue to happen, unless public officials and consumers collectively stop them in their tracks.
Instead of just sitting back and complaining about what the dental prosthetics industry most likely is doing to delay and even obstruct the availability of both tooth regeneration procedures here in the United States of America, I believe that the best course of action is for all of us to do something about it. The question is, “What can we do?” These greedy corporate shysters have so much money that it is not going to be easy for any of us to undermine their efforts to deprive the world of both tooth regeneration procedures. Some of you may be thinking about writing letters to your elected officials for that matter. My response to your course of action is that it can’t hurt. However, I believe that there really is only one truly effective course of action that the public can take to stop these greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry from getting in the way of both tooth regeneration procedures becoming available to the public someday in the near future.
People have large quantities of money invested in stocks that fund these companies that manufacture prosthetic dental materials. Many of you out there who are reading this Hub may be one of those investors. Therefore, any of you who have money invested in these companies need to sell those stocks now and pull your money out of these companies while you can. In other words, as the saying goes, if you take away the food, the cockroaches starve and eventually die. In this case, the greedy corporate shysters who own these dental prosthetics companies are the cockroaches that need to be financially starved out of business. To all of you out there who may have money invested in these companies, I am well aware that your money is your money and that you are free to do with it as you please. However, if you cannot sell your stocks and pull your money investments out of these companies for the sake of the public interests, then do it for yourself.
Whether you like it or not, the dental prosthetics industry is going to collapse sooner or later. These greedy corporate shysters can buy themselves more time to extend their lavish lifestyles at the expense and detriment of others, but their dental prosthetics empires are not going to last forever. Once both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the general public, your stocks are going to plummet so quickly in value that you will not know what hit you; and you just don’t want to be caught up in that rapid loss of money that investors who still have their money tied up in stocks with these companies will suffer. Moreover, these greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry don’t care about anybody but themselves, and they are simply not worth it. This is something that affects everyone of every socioeconomic structure, because most everybody would prefer to have a natural set of teeth rather than have a mouth full of crowns, dental implants, and other prosthetic dental materials.
The greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry may not make themselves or their reprehensible actions readily obvious to the public at large, but you only have to be aware of the unusual delay of both tooth regeneration procedures becoming publicly available to know that it is more likely than not that these same greedy corporate shysters are doing everything that they can to stand between the public and tooth regeneration. The dental prosthetics industry has long outlived its purpose here in the United States of America, and it is time to put these jokers out of business once and for all to clear the pathway for new and improved dental technology in the form of tooth regeneration. If investors pull their money out of these self-serving companies and sell their stocks, these companies will eventually weaken and lose their financial ability to interfere with the efforts of Dr. Mao and others like him to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the world. If these companies’ monetary assets begin to dry up, they will be spending so much of their financial resources in trying to keep themselves afloat that they won’t have the time or the economic stamina to throw political roadblocks at Dr. Mao and others like him. All of us could have a healthy mouth of pearly whites if we just work together to make it happen.

Becerra said:
“Human trafficking, which includes sex and labor trafficking, is one of the fasting growing crimes in the world. Its reach is not limited to foreign countries...In California, human trafficking is reported here in our state more than in any other.”
The investigation of the sex slave ring began with a missing persons report of a teenager from Tulare County in late 2016. Investigators found that traffickers used high-end sports cars, such as a 2017 Maserati Ghibli, a 2017 Maserati Levante, and a 2016 Porsche Panameran, to transport girls throughout the western United States.

Both state law enforcement officials and local police believed the witnesses, dozens of children, some of them grown up.

0000988,VIDEO: Michael Moore — ‘I Refuse To Live In A Country Where’ Trump Is President’,"Good.
He appeared on Colbert’s show (of course) and the two of them went off on President Trump yet again. Moore is calling for the formation of a citizen army to unseat the President. That’s called incitement and he should be prosecuted for it. Then he tried to make it seem like he’s joking (he’s not) and said they have to bring Trump down with satire. Lame.
From The Daily Caller:
Michael Moore says that he refuse “to live in a country where Donald Trump is president.”
“I refuse to live in a country where Donald Trump is president and I’m not leaving,” the 63-year-old filmmaker said during his appearance Wednesday night on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”
“So somethings gotta change,” he added. “We have to form an army of citizens and come at him like a swarm of bees where he’s hit one way, all the way. Because I think the way to bring him down is with satire.”
John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters.
“His thin skin, as you’ve pointed out so well, is so thin,” he continued. “All we need is like a thousand or a million little comedy shivs–just, you know, non-violent, don’t hurt him, but just under his skin. Because he can’t take being laughed at.”
The filmmaker also went after the president after Trump announced via Twitter that the “United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals” to serve in the military.
He’s literally advocating killing Trump with comedy because he is so thin-skinned. Dream on. What a moron. I think he’s doing this just to get airtime and attention. He can’t possibly be serious. Far more people are laughing at Moore and Colbert than they are Trump. Trust me on that one. They looked like unhinged buffoons.
Moore of course went after the banning of transgenders in the military, which was the right thing to do and I commend President Trump for it. “What’s so disgusting about this…if you are transgender trying to get by in this society… I can’t think of any more brave people to have then transgender,” Moore explained, adding that those reportedly serving in the military should refuse to leave. Except that depending on what the military decides, they don’t have a say in the matter. But of course, Moore has never served, so he has no idea what he is blathering about.
Moore talked about having warned Hillary Clinton about Trump. At least that much he got right. “I actually contacted the people in the Clinton campaign and said ‘I think you need to spend more time in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania,’” Moore said. “These are the Brexit States of America. And there’s a lot of angry people. They don’t sorta like Trump that much, but they see him as their human molotov cocktail that they want to just throw into the system that has hurt them so badly. I couldn’t get anybody to listen to me.”
Clinton lost, Trump won and Moore can’t stand it. He should either get over it or leave. I’m all for him leaving frankly. If his only plan is to bludgeon Trump with jokes, then he’s delusional. These people never ever learn.",unknown,True
0000989,BREAKING: California Is Officially First ‘Sanctuary State’ – Passed By Senate,"We all knew this was coming, but somehow I never really thought they’d go all the way. California just did… early this morning the California legislature voted to approve a bill that would limit police cooperation with federal immigration authorities, according to multiple reports. This officially makes them the first full-fledged sanctuary state in the union. Bonus, yesterday a federal judge ruled against Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the potential to withhold government assistance from Chicago and other so-called sanctuary cities. A showdown is looming and it’s going to get ugly folks.
This bill will prohibit additional jail time meant to allow immigration enforcement officials to take undocumented immigrants arrested for other reasons into custody. In other words, it stymies ICE. The measure that passed however will still allow jail and prison officials to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record. But I wouldn’t count on it. ICE will still be able to interview suspects in custody. Governor Jerry Brown is expected to sign the legislation.
The bill was argued over for some time, but it was passed at the last minute. The final version of the bill was released Monday but California requires bills to be published in their final form for 72 hours before a vote. California’s lower chamber passed the bill on Friday. The California Senate wrapped its session up this morning following the vote.
This comes less than one day after that federal judge blocked Jeff Session’s from pulling funding from sanctuary cities. I don’t think that is going to hold up legally though. A number of progressive cities across the country have sought to defy President Trump’s immigration enforcement policies. They require that state and local communities allow federal immigration access to detention facilities and provide 48 hours notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities. Otherwise, these illegal aliens are simply released back into the general population.
California is the most leftist state in the nation, so it figures this would happen there first. They are broke and have turned themselves into a third-world hellhole. Heck, San Diego is sanitizing the streets because hepatitis killed 15 and sickened 400 this month. That didn’t come from the homeless, it came from illegal aliens bringing it from south of the border. Another deadly gift to Americans. Sacramento is actually ‘paying’ gang bangers now not to kill people. They’ve totally lost it in a communist frenzy over there. Looks like Democrats want to make California Mexico again.",unknown,True

The dominant force in America and many other Western countries today is fear of the left.
This is a result of the fact that the most dynamic religion of the past 100 years has been neither Christianity nor Islam. It has been leftism. Whoever does not recognize this does not understand the contemporary world.
Leftism—in its incarnations, such as Marxism, communism, and socialism; expressed through egalitarianism, environmentalism, and feminism; in its denigration of capitalism and Western civilization, especially America and Israel; in its supplanting of Christianity and Judaism; through its influence on Christianity and Judaism; in its celebration of race; and in its replacing of reason with romanticism—has almost completely taken over the news and entertainment media and institutions of education.
There is a largely (though not entirely) nonviolent reign of ideological terror in America. In almost every area of life, people fear antagonizing the left.
Last week, before my speech at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a man employed by the university (I will not say in what department) walked over to me, looked around to see whether anyone was watching, and whispered in my ear, “I’m a conservative.”
This happens just about everywhere I speak. People whisper—yes, whisper—that they are conservative or they support President Donald Trump. The last time I experienced people looking around to check whether they were seen speaking to me was with dissidents in the Soviet Union.
People call my radio show from all over the country to say that their fellow musicians, nurses, teachers, or employees do not know that they are conservative, let alone that they support the president.
I have called contemporary conservatives in America Marranos, the name given during the 15th-century Spanish Inquisition to Jews who hid their Judaism while appearing to be Catholics, lest they be persecuted. I do not compare the consequences: Losing one’s friends or employment is not the same as losing one’s home or one’s life. But otherwise, the label is apt.

Why are so many Democrats shocked when a Republican is elected president? Because, as they themselves say, they “don’t know anyone” who voted for the Republican. The primary reason for this is the people in their life who voted for Trump—professional colleagues, and even friends and relatives—are afraid to tell them.
There are two reasons the left labels most conservatives and all Trump supporters “white supremacists,” “neo-Nazis,” and “racists.” One is to defeat conservatives without having to defeat conservative ideas. The other is to instill fear: Speak out and you will suffer the consequences.
Parents call my radio show and ask what they should tell their children at college when they ask whether they should risk receiving a lower grade for divulging their conservative politics in a paper or on an exam.
It is becoming more and more common for leftist mobs to gather in front of a conservative’s home, scream epithets at the conservative’s family members, and vandalize the home. Just last week, the Associated Press reported:
Protesters are targeting the northern Virginia home of the National Rifle Association’s top lobbyist … Chris Cox … as well as his wife’s nearby decorating business. … Libby Locke, a lawyer for the Cox family, said the vandalism included spraying fake blood and defacing the home with stickers.
Left-wing student mobs routinely take over the offices of university deans, professors, and even presidents. The few non-left-wing professors on any campus understand their lives will be made miserable if they speak out. The widely reported case of liberal biology professor Bret Weinstein at Evergreen State College in Washington is directly on point.
In May 2017, Weinstein was surrounded by about 50 left-wing students, who screamed curses at him outside of his classroom for refusing to participate in an event during which white people were asked to leave the campus for a day.
On May 24, 2017, Weinstein tweeted: “the police told me I am not safe on campus. They can not protect me.”
To be clear: the police told me I am not safe on campus. They can not protect me. Students in jeopardy. No contact from admin. George?
— Bret Weinstein (@BretWeinstein)
Within a few months, left-wing students and the left-wing Evergreen administration made life so miserable for the lifelong liberal professor he left the university.
Since the left began spreading the lie that a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, shot a black youth because he, like most police officers, is a racist, police officers in many cities have feared taking proactive measures to prevent violent crime in black neighborhoods. They fear the left-wing mob known as the news media will ruin their reputation and end their career.
In the recent case of a Philadelphia Starbucks manager who asked two black men to purchase something before giving them the code to the restroom, Starbucks immediately appeased the left-wing mob. The company didn’t wait until any facts came out; it simply abandoned the manager and announced it would close every U.S. store one day in May to educate all Starbucks employees about “unconscious bias.”

0000991,Breitbart News Just FIRED Steve Bannon. It's A Good Day For Andrew Breitbart's Legacy.,"On Tuesday, Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon — a man who used his position to shift Breitbart News into a propaganda outlet on behalf of his own political interests — found himself jobless and perhaps homeless after being unceremoniously fired by the Breitbart News board. That firing, spearheaded by the Mercer family, followed hard on President Trump destroying Bannon in a public statement after Bannon told muckraking author Michael Wolff that the Trump campaign had engaged in criminal and treasonous activity. Bannon also ushered Wolff into the heart of the West Wing, where Wolff used his position to cobble together his bestselling gossip book, Fire and Fury.
Bannon’s ouster is a long time in coming. Actually, Bannon never should have been hired in the first place. He was not a close friend of Andrew Breitbart’s; he was instead a fellow who attempted to use his minimal documentary-making skills to ingratiate himself with Breitbart, making a movie with Breitbart as narrator. That unwatchable monstrosity was Bannon’s calling card after Breitbart died; Larry Solov, Breitbart’s business partner and lifelong friend, turned to Bannon in the aftermath of Breitbart’s tragic passing.
Bannon gradually began exerting more and more control over editorial of the site; by 2015, as outside observers noted, Bannon had shifted the site into fully political, DC-centric, Trumpian territory. This wasn’t at all what Andrew had intended: Andrew saw the site as a weapon in the fight against what he called the “Democrat-Media Complex,” destroying left-wing narratives crafted by the faux-objective media. Andrew believed that his site could play an outsized role in the culture war, and he saw culture as upstream of politics. And Andrew wanted to do so in the mold of the “happy warrior,” not as the grim-faced, stubble-bearded force of darkness Bannon attempted to project.
Bannon, by contrast, saw the site as a lever to exert influence in the circles of power — or at least the impression of influence. And he would abuse and use anyone he needed to in order to pose as Darth Vader.
By January 2016, it was clear to anyone with two eyes that Bannon had transformed the site into a propaganda outlet on behalf of the Trump campaign, and weaponized the site against Trump’s opponents. That wasn’t out of pure love for Trump — it was out of a pathetic desire to hitch his wagon to the next rising star.
And it got worse: Bannon decided that he would make common cause with the execrable alt-right in order to maximize his influence. To that end, he elevated Milo Yiannopoulos, bragged about making a site founded by a proud anti-racist into a “platform for the alt-right,” and used the site as his personal vendetta machine.
Bannon rode Trump’s star all the way to the White House — all the while, bragging that he was the real brains behind the operation. In reality, he had little to do with Trump’s success: he was only on the Trump campaign at all because the Mercers placed him there, along with Kellyanne Conway. Then, in the White House, he spent his days botching policy (see the original travel ban rollout) and pushing Trump to ally with awful people (see his reported advice on Charlottesville) and posturing as the Great Thinker of Trumpism — meanwhile leaking to the press as much as he could about his enemies inside the administration and the supposed dunderhead he had to shepherd through basic tasks.
Finally, in August, Trump dumped him. And Bannon went right back to the “machine” he had built, ready to maximize his own profile. He launched a doomed campaign on behalf of Alabama’s Roy Moore, and somehow suckered Trump into endorsing Moore; he even deployed reporters to Alabama to try to debunk Moore’s alleged molestation victims, knowing full well that they were credible. He lost.
And then, finally, the chickens came home to roost: all of that backbiting and self-promoting blew him up when Wolff’s book came out. Trump can abide anything but disloyalty. And Bannon, it turns out — as all of us who knew him knew — is a deeply disloyal human being.
Thus he had to go.
Steve Bannon has never built anything; he is a creature of destruction. He rides more powerful hosts until they drop beneath him, whispering sweet nothings in their ears. He tried to glom onto Sarah Palin’s celebrity. He did the same with Michele Bachmann, Andrew Breitbart, and Trump. All of those people built things. Bannon built nothing. He just stood atop the foundations they had erected, shouting his own name.
Now, he has nothing. He built a monument to himself, and it collapsed. He has no money; the Mercers are out. He has no power; the White House is out. He has no bullhorn: Breitbart is out. He's back to what he had originally: his cunning and his nastiness and his shameless sycophancy-for-hire. Good luck to him.
So, where does Breitbart go from here? The great tragedy in all of this is that Breitbart’s name has been smeared with Bannon’s toxicity. Now they’ll have to rebuild. They can do so by either returning to Andrew’s original mission, which would require some humility, some decency — or they can become a shadow of their former Bannon.com glory, trying to pander to political patrons rather than standing for truth. That’s their choice.
But at least for today, it’s a good day for Andrew Breitbart. May they all be good days from now on.",unknown,True

It’s too hard, I’m too old.'”' Yeah, those are just eldergays who are in a snit that they will never fuck Colto. Or anyone else ever again.
They are so very much psychotically fixated on all things female, that they feel gay men eschewing females means that there is something mentally ill about THEM! In other words, T is perfectly normal, gay male is ""perverted.""
At this point, I begin to wonder whether the gay males at national organizations like HRC are aware of this situation, or have somehow suppressed or compartmentalized it away?
T get to say anything they like. Their feelings are all that anyone cares about. Noone cares that this T bitch telling lies and slandering gays will confuse and upset young gays facing homophobia and worried about coming out. Fuck Attitude, fuck this T slag.
This must be a work of science fiction. A man can never be a woman and vice versa.
Or maybe her hormone therapy included some hallucinogens...
Sadly, The way I see the situation finally being resolved will eventually involve Republicans, not wanting to appear homophobic so they pass laws that cover sexual orientation only, and do not mention gender identity at all. Democrats are far too steeped in the SJW quicksand to ever consider doing this.
I'm really beginning to hate those people - and the stupid ass idiots who are enabling them to evangelize their stupidity.
Hypocrites - imagine what they'd say if we started saying stuff like that about them. They're melt if we use the ""wrong"" pronoun, let alone spouting unfounded psychobabble drivel about them.
So now we're to be lectured and demeaned by a heterosexual woman (because that's what this Person would say she is).
In any other situation, the perpetrator would be told she was deeply homophobic, and to fuck off.
Why I stopped reading ""the gay press"". Fucking hate speech. The author of the interview (not the trans interviewee) adds this teeny tiny editorial note: ""This may seem like a controversial statement, but it is something that Juno has experienced since she came out as trans.""

Indivisible is demanding that powerful Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer put a stop to the legislation that provides the wall, as well as any bill that limits
“The activists are organizing phone call campaigns this week to pressure Democrats to reject any DACA legislation that includes funding for border security measures.
“The well-funded activists have made clear that their protests and demonstrations won’t cease with Congress passing amnesty for DACA recipients (so-called ‘Dreamers’).
“They want Democrats to oppose legislation that would allow federal officials to better enforce federal immigration law, and portray border laws as ‘criminalizing immigrants.’ Laws providing more border agents or border security measures are unacceptable, according to the open borders activists, who are demanding that Democrats do everything they can to oppose further funding for border enforcement.
“The activists are also demanding Democrats oppose ‘Kate’s Law,’ which enacts harsher penalties on criminal illegal aliens. The law is named for Kate Steinle, a San Francisco woman who was murder by an illegal immigrant in 2015. The Soros-funded activists frame the legislation as ‘criminalizing immigrants seeking to reunite with their families.’”

0000995,"Bernie Sanders to College Graduates: Take on the Fossil Fuel Industry, Transform Our Energy System","Sen.
Sanders recounted learning about ""oligarchic societies"" when he was a high school student in Brooklyn. Described to him as ""small developing countries"" in which the ""economic and political life of the nation were controlled by a handful of very wealthy people,"" Sanders admitted it ""never occurred to me as a kid in Brooklyn that the United States of America, our great nation, could move in that direction."" But, he added, ""that is precisely ... what is happening today.""
Bernie Sanders: 'This Is Exactly What We Mean When We Talk About Oligarchy' https://t.co/8gqKgk0NZ8 @OpenSecretsDC @SunFoundation
While commending graduating students and their parents for often working multiple jobs in order to make ends meet, Sanders lamented that more than fifty percent of all new income now ""goes to the top one percent"" of earners.
And in order to disrupt and combat such a system, Sanders said that throwing up your hands and giving up was simply not a viable option.
""The truth is that the only rational choice we have, the only real response we can make is to stand up and fight back—reclaim American democracy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent,"" he said. ""And for us to do that it is necessary that we fight for a vision of a new America. An America based on progressive, humane values, not the values of the oligarchy.""
As he railed against economic inequality and a system rigged in favor of the wealthy and powerful, Sanders told students that unity would be key in order to defeat the destructive forces represented by President
Sanders referenced his Jewish heritage and his family's experience with the Holocaust in Europe, which he said offered important lessons for ""tough times"" like these.
""From that experience, what was indelibly stamped on my mind was the understanding that we must never allow demagogues to divide us up by race, by religion, by national origin, by gender or sexual orientation,"" Sanders said to wide applause. ""Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American, Christian, Jew, Muslim and every religion, straight or gay, male or female—we must stand together. This country belongs to all of us.""
Sanders concluded on a message of hope, telling the graduates that Americans are ""prepared to stand together; if we take on greed and selfishness; if we refuse to allow demagogues to divide us up there is no end to what the great people of our nation can accomplish.""
Watch the full commencement address:
The full transcript of Sanders remarks follows:
You know and I know that these are tough times for our country. But I do want to say that standing up here and looking out at the beautiful people in front of me, I have enormous confidence in the future of our country.
Let me begin by congratulating the graduating class of 2017. Today is an important day in your lives, something that I know you have worked very hard to achieve, and I want to wish all of you the very best of luck in your future endeavors.
I do want, on behalf of my wife, Jane, and myself, to pray that you all live healthy and happy lives, doing the work you enjoy surrounded in love by family and friends.
Let me thank President Michelle Anderson, Nicole Haas, the Brooklyn College Administration, faculty and staff and all of you for inviting Jane and me back to Brooklyn where we were both born and raised. I am greatly honored of the honorary degree you have given me.
I grew up in Flatbush and, like Senator Schumer, graduated from James Madison High School. My wife, Jane, was also raised Flatbush and Bedford-Stuyvesant, and graduated from St. Savior's High School a few miles away from here.
In 1959, as a first-generation college student I attended Brooklyn College for a year—a year which had a major impact in my life. After that year I left for the University of Chicago, where I eventually graduated. My mom had died the previous year and I felt it was time to leave the neighborhood and see what the rest of the world looked like.
My childhood in Brooklyn was shaped by two profound realities. First, my mom, dad and older brother, who graduated from Brooklyn College, lived in a 3 1/2 room rent-controlled apartment. As with many of your families who don't have a lot of money, financial pressures caused friction and tension within our household. From those experiences of growing up without a lot of money, I have never forgotten that there are millions of people throughout this country who struggle to put food on the table, pay the electric bill, try to save for their kids' education or for retirement—people who against great odds are fighting today to live in dignity.
The second reality that impacted my life was that my father left Poland at the age of 17 from a community which was not only very poor, but from a country where anti-Semitism, pogroms and attacks on Jews were not uncommon. While my father emigrated to the United States, and escaped Hitler and the Holocaust, many in his family did not. For them, racism, right-wing extremism and ultra-nationalism were not ""political issues."" They were issues of life and death—and some of them died horrific deaths.
From that experience, what was indelibly stamped on my mind was the understanding that we must never allow demagogues to divide us up by race, by religion, by national origin, by gender or sexual orientation. Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American, Christian, Jew, Muslim and every religion, straight or gay, male or female, we must stand together. This country belongs to all of us.
As a United States senator from Vermont let me give you a very brief overview of some of the serious crises we currently face—crises which do not often get attention they deserve.
As a student at James Madison High School, many years ago, I recall my social studies teacher talking about how there were small developing countries around the world that were ""oligarchic"" societies—places where the economic and political life of the nation were controlled by a handful of very wealthy people. It never occurred to me as a kid in Brooklyn that the United States of America, our great nation, could move in that direction. But that is precisely, in my view, what is happening today.
Today, the top one-tenth of one percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Twenty Americans now own as much wealth as the bottom half of America and one family now owns more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of our people. In the last 17 years, while the middle class continues to decline, we have seen a tenfold increase in the number of billionaires. Today in America CEOs are earning almost 350 times more than the average worker makes. In terms of income, while you and your parents are working in some cases two or three jobs, 52 percent of all new income goes to the top one percent.
At the same time as we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major nation, 43 million Americans live in poverty, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country in earth, half of older workers have nothing in the bank as they approach retirement and in some inner cities and rural communities, youth unemployment is 20, 30, 40 percent. Unbelievably, in our country today as a result of hopelessness and despair we are seeing a decline in life expectancy. People are giving up. And they're turning to drugs, to alcohol, and even to suicide. And because of poverty, racism today in a broken criminal justice system we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. Those people are disproportionately black, Latino and Native American.
Directly related to the oligarchic economy that we currently have is corrupt political system which is undermining American democracy and it's important we talk about that and understand that. As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, corporations and billionaires are able to spend unlimited sums of money on elections. The result is that today a handful of billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars every single year, often on ugly 30-second TV ads, helping to elect candidates who represent the rich and the powerful get elected.
And we are seeing the results of how oligarchy functions right now in Congress where the Republican leadership wants to throw 23 million American off of health insurance, cut Medicaid by over $800 billion, defund Planned Parenthood, cut food stamps and other nutrition programs by over $200 billion, cut Head Start and after school programs, and by the way, make drastic cuts in Pell grants and other programs that help working class kids be able to go to college.
And, unbelievably, at exactly the same time that they are throwing people off health care, making it harder to people to go to college, they have the chutzpah to provide the $300 billion in tax breaks to the top one percent. In other words, the very, very rich are getting richer and they get huge tax cuts. The working class and the middle class are struggling and they are seeing drastic cuts in life or death programs that could mean survival or not for those families.
Now, in response to these very serious crises it seems to me that we have two choices. First we can throw up our hands in despair. We can say, ""I am not going to get involved.""
That is understandable. But it is wrong.
Because the issues that we deal with today—the economic issues, the social issues, the racial issues, the environmental issues—not only impact your lives, they impact the lives of future generations and you do not have the moral right to turn your back on saving this planet and saving future generations.
The truth is that the only rational choice we have, the only real response we can make is to stand up and fight back — reclaim American democracy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent.
And for us to do that it is necessary that we fight for a vision of a new America. An America based on progressive, humane values, not the values of the oligarchy.
And what does that mean, briefly in concrete terms?
It means that, no, we are not going to throw 23 million Americans off the health care they have. We are going to bring about health care for all as a right, not a privilege.
It means that, no, we are not, as the current administration does, deny the reality of climate change. We are going to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
It means no we are not going to cut Pell grants and other student assistance. We are going to do what Germany, what Scandinavia, what countries all over the world do. And that is to make certain the public colleges and universities are tuition-free and we're going to significantly lower student debt because we believe that anyone in America who has the ability and the desire to be able to get a higher education regardless of his or her income.
And no we're not going to do what the attorney general of the United States now wants. We're not going to put more people in jail. We're going to fix a broken criminal justice system and invest in education and jobs for our young people, not more jails and incarceration.
No, we're not going to defund Planned Parenthood. We're going to vigorously defend a woman's right to choose.
My friends, let me conclude by saying this. We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world. We are seeing exploding technology, which if used well, has extraordinary potential to improve life. We are an intelligent and hardworking people. If we are prepared to stand together; if we take on greed and selfishness; if we refuse to allow demagogues to divide us up there is no end to what the great people of our nation can accomplish.
So today as you graduate Brooklyn College, my message to you is very simple. Think big, not small, and help us create the nation that we all know we can become. Thank you all very much.

Somehow, Jemele Hill finds herself smack dab in the middle of a racial maelstrom that has been ravaging our country since its inception.

Donald Trump is an embarrassment to our great nation.

A young woman died that day.
Sure, Trump wasn’t behind the wheel of that death car, but he was the one pumping the tank full of gas.

0000998,Don't Forget About the Liberal Fascists,"To be clear, this column is about influential media pundits and reporters choosing which violent groups they report ... and which they ignore.
“... anti-fascists stand up and kick the -- — out of fascists. That’s what we need!”
As reported by The Daily Caller, that’s Norman Clement, a member of the left-wing ANSWER Coalition, introducing speakers at a Hartford, Connecticut, Sunday night vigil to “reflect” on the Charlottesville violence over the weekend.
This profane rallying cry for violence on whomever they decide is a fascist was directed to the hundreds of attendees, including New Haven mayoral candidate Marcus Paca and current Mayor Toni Harp.
It’s reflective of the violence fomented at Trump rallies by Scott Foval, former national field director of the left-wing Americans United for Change.
He confessed, on video, of staging the violence at Trump rallies for the Democratic National Committee to provoke Trump supporters into violence.
In Berkeley, California this year, left-wing activists attacked unarmed Trump supporters, hurled Molotov cocktails and smashed windows in protest of a planned speech by conservative antagonist Milo Yiannopoulos, causing $100,000 in property damage.
On top of that was an incident where two Berkeley College Republicans “were attacked while conducting an interview” on the campus, and another where a woman wearing a red Trump hat was pepper-sprayed in the face while being interviewed by a local CNN affiliate.
This is the violent left that pundits “outraged” at Trump’s incompetent initial articulation dangerously ignore.
After an unsatisfying statement excoriating violence “on both sides” while shockingly omitting any reference to the murdered Heather Heyer, Trump later clearly denounced the Klan and white supremacists as “criminals” and “thugs.”
“You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch,” Trump said.
“It is impossible to imagine President Trump saying that both sides are responsible for the violence, saying that the people that came out against these extremists are equally to blame,” said The Lead host Jake Tapper.
“This is a sad moment for the country,” opined Don Lemon. “I think it was an awful moment for the person who is supposed to represent the highest office of the land.”
“There today,” he told, Wolf Blitzer, “you saw the real Donald Trump proving all of his critics right in that moment.”
Lemon defended the alt-left group because “that group protests fascism. So that group was protesting fascism.” Then, Lemon forgave the left-wing violence saying, “Maybe their tactics weren’t exactly right ... it’s messy.”
Their tactics were to come to the white supremacist rally armed with bats and pepper spray and attack the racists. That’s messy, alright. Lemon ignored those violent thugs because the other side “is a Nazi, white supremacist group” and “what they want to do in their hearts is extinguish people who look like me and who look like you, Wolf, Jewish people, black people, even women.” They overlook that the violent left is also using fascist tactics, and if their ultimate goal is an all-powerful government with control over its people and businesses, as many espouse, then they, too are fascists.
Yes, the klan and white supremacists are evil and, as Republican Ted Cruz says, “These bigots want to tear our country apart, but they will fail. America is far better than this.”
I hope so, because while it’s as easy to hate Nazis as it is to love puppies, CNN seems to have an especially difficult time accepting the fact that there are leftwing criminals and thugs ideologically justifying violence.
By ignoring and forgiving the violent left, are the Don Lemons of the media suggesting the shooting of Republican Representative Steve Scalise by a left-winger is not so bad compared to the murder of Heather Heyer by a neo-nazi?
Once violence is accepted as legitimate political speech, only violence remains.

0000999,Political paranoia in the 21st century,"Evil versus good. No, that’s too deep and overarching. How about Republican versus Democrat or conservative versus liberal? Populist versus elitist? Nationalist versus globalist? Let’s not forget capitalist versus socialist and Libertarian versus fascist.
My point is this: Political labels abound and leave much to be desired. They signify different things to different people, if they signify anything at all. Some are pejoratives: Calling a pol a populist may elicit a smile or a sneer.
Some cover so much of the political spectrum, they are meaningless. The average American would be hard-pressed to define Libertarian. For that matter, the average Libertarian would be hard-pressed to define Libertarian. Labels are purely a convenience, a bit of necessary mental laziness we rely on daily. They serve to evoke but seldom accurately portray one’s beliefs or principles.
Still, some adjectives do have a place in our political dialogue and it is at the edges where they may be the most accurate. There, the one label that is quite appropriate, that applies strikingly to our present political situation, and especially to the radical right, is “paranoid.”
(The radical left is not immune to this affliction but a cursory reading of history finds the far right more heavily infected.) It is at the edges of sanity and society where one finds the ideologues holed up in the confines of their mental rigidity and dogmatism hiding from a world that is out to get them. There are only a few ways to say “crazy” and they are all unambiguous.
Those of you who have read Richard Hofstadter’s essay, “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” will see his influence here. Let me quote him: “In recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme right-wingers, who have demonstrated […] how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and passions of a small minority.”
He was writing about Arizonan Barry Goldwater’s run for the White House in 1964 but one could substitute Donald Trump and the alt-right here and do no harm. It is spookily parallel to the present day.
Of the anti-Masonic (read anti-liberal or pro-conformity, if you will) movement of the early 1800s, he writes, “It attracted the support of several reputable statesmen who had only mild sympathy with its fundamental bias but who as politicians could not afford to ignore it. Still, it was a folk movement of considerable power, and the rural enthusiasts who provided its real impetus believed in it wholeheartedly.”
This is another uncanny parallel to our current dilemma. Replace “folk movement” with the current populist reincarnation and it loses no relevancy. And there are more than a few latter-day “reputable statesmen” to the right of center who prize re-election over integrity and honesty.
Paul Ryan occasionally loses patience with Trump but is not going to abandon him and his chance to push the right-wing agenda. He gives the president a mulligan, claiming, “He’s new at government.” What a lame dodge! Why would you put a landlubber at the helm of state? (Ironically, it is Barry Goldwater’s home state of Arizona that has given us Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain, men of conscience who do not shrink from criticizing the president.)
Hofstadter continues, “I call it the paranoid style simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy I have in mind.”
Heated exaggeration? Trump claims the biggest inaugural crowds ever, the largest electoral win since Reagan, and $10 billion in the bank. Suspiciousness? Obama tapped my phone, the election is rigged and Comey is out to get me. Conspiratorial fantasy? The fake news is persecuting me, Ted Cruz’s father had ties to Lee Harvey Oswald, and global warming is a Chinese plot.
Steve Bannon is a versed conspiracist and political trickster who sees bogeymen everywhere, qualifications that will serve him well in his return to Breitbart.
He also delivered the most heated exaggeration of all, touting the ineloquent Trump as the greatest public speaker since William Jennings Bryan, a statement so baldly absurd, no rebuttal is needed. Stumping at a rally for Alabama Sen.-elect, Roy Moore, Bannon whipped the crowd into a frenzy, urging them to show the world “that this populist, nationalist, conservative movement is on the rise.”
He is the picture of demagoguery. A 74-year-old widow at the rally explained her vote for Moore, “Steve Bannon and God spoke to me […] and I voted for Moore.” It is a scary mentality that puts Bannon and God in the same sentence and gives Bannon top billing. Spookiness again.
Ultimately, the method becomes the message and the paranoid style overpowers any sound ideas its adherents may put forth.
America has survived these political mood swings in the past and we will survive them today. Trump’s election triggered the pressure valve. We will undo the damage done. And all the radical right’s exaggerations, suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasies cannot change that.

We strongly condemn his behavior and believe each and every woman who has spoken out about what he did to them.
Unfortunately, one of the sunniest cities in America is also the darkest: This is not new behavior in Hollywood. People are frequently taken advantage of because people in positions of power believe they can get away with it. This can’t be how Hollywood works. Abusers can’t get away with their actions because they hold keys to success, or have enough money to pay off their victims.

So beginning immediately, Hypable will add a note to all articles about a film, TV show, book, etc. that employs an accused predator.

While he has been fired since the bombshell reports on his behavior, several of his business associates knew about his conduct and did nothing to stop it.
And the list goes on. We’ll inform you about other alleged predators,
The studios and their publicists are hoping you forget about the accusations so their projects aren’t negatively affected, but at Hypable, forgetting is over. We will not forget what these people did, or in some cases, still do. These people need to be removed from Hollywood.

The KKK did their evil deeds based on emotion and hatred of people different from themselves, and today’s ANTIFA do their evil deeds based on hate and a steady income from the Democrat Party, which has for a long time hired unemployed union members and out-of-work derelicts to threaten, beat people and burn things, and most recently to cause trouble for anyone involved in the Trump presidential campaign or any person who is a supporter of President Trump’s administration.

0001002,Donald Trump is lying about DACA immigration policy,"President Donald Trump.YouTube
President Trump has been hammering the Democratic Party leadership and blaming them for the imminent demise of DACA, the program that allows
According to Trump’s trumped up version of events, several times he has offered a deal to keep DACA in return for concessions on admitting fewer legal immigrants and building a wall on the Mexican border.
What Trump neglects to mention is that he alone decided to imperil DACA by announcing he was ending it by March 5, which if course he did not do.
He instead has been using DACA as a Sword of Damocles over Democrats, warning he will end it if they don’t come to the table on his terms.
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!
Democrats have rightly refused to be rolled on the issue, pointing out very clearly that DACA was doing just fine until Trump placed it in peril. Polls show that over 80 percent of Americans believe that the DACA kids, many of whom were newborn or toddlers when they were brought to America, should be allowed stay.
That wish for them to stay is the generous vision of America that so many Americans share. Instead, we get a narrow, twisted, devious president who tries to bargain with young lives.
Read more:
Imagine you are a child of DACA who grew up in this great country, never learned your parent's language but built a career and life for yourself here.
Now you are in deep danger of being snapped away by a president who sees you and all your fellow DACA recipients as an extendable piece of political theater.
Shame on you President Trump. The lack of a generous vision and the urge to demonize other countries and communities has come as a shocking revelation to the majority of Americans.
Trump is living proof that you can fool most of the people most of the time.
He was never a good businessman no matter the boastful rhetoric. He went broke or his companies went broke five times.
He ripped off students at Trump University, the make-believe college he made up. Indicative of the true Trump is the fact that teachers promised a photo op with Trump and got a cardboard cut out instead.
We have a cardboard cutout president too, except this guy just gets more confused and dangerous every day.
DACA is a perfect example of his inability to frame or make policy. Likewise with gun control where he first boasted about taking on the NRA, then ran for cover when they showed him how they made him president.
Then there are the tawdry women that “Spankie” hung out with. He is not the first nor will he be the last womanizer in the White House but it is truly incredible how his evangelical, holier than thou multitudes of followers continue to support him.
It seems the evangelicals are composed of a flock of Elmer Gantrys as much as their preachers who should bear the same name for their double standards and bitter hypocrisy.
We Americans can hang on until the November elections and see retribution for this Potemkin White House run by a fake leader with no clue about what he is doing.
The DACA kids, however, have no such opportunity. Their crisis is now and it looks certain to end badly.
If there is a shred of humanity in this man called Trump he will allow them to stay -- but we won’t be holding our breath.

0001003,Criminals With Violent Histories Respect FEAR,"It makes no difference if you have a PhD in psychology, sociology, criminology, or any social engineering field. If you do not have hands-on experience in the field, on the road, working with the miscreants of society, you don’t know . . . Well, you know how that ends.
In my experience, most people will react in a positive, if not a hesitant manner, with logical motivation, especially if you treat them with respect. However, there are those in a minority group of violent, repetitive thugs, criminals, animals that respect one thing, and only one thing. FEAR! You can try to conjole them, placate them into calm, and handle them with kid gloves to no avail. They do understand pepper spray, ASP, PR-24, Taser, and gunshot wounds. If you put fear into their heads, they will react with a certain amount of respect, usually in your favor. Sometimes, though, the only way to protect yourself from these animals is by shooting them in self-defense.
When you have a rapist, pedophile, abusive spouse/parent/sibling/child, armed robber, murderer, it is unlikely, if they have a history of these types of arrests, that they will ever result in a full and positive rehabilitation of their malevolent behavior. They tend to have children who have only that one (or both) miscreant parent(s); and, thus, the children use their parental models to become poorly adjusted and just as bad.
How do you remove this type of behavior from society, with utmost reliability? There are several ways. They all involve the death of the individual(s). By rifle squad, guillotine, electric chair, toxic injection, or other form of termination (punishment for their actions).
Consequently, does this seem uncivil? Unjustified? Inhuman? NO!
Consider the inhuman treatment that these thugs have inflicted upon their victims, mostly women, children, helpless beings, and innocent ones. Therefore, is that more acceptable than the death of these animals?
Moreover, I believe most people who are first responders, whether law enforcement officers, fire personnel, EMTs, even nurses and doctors, would agree that a sudden loss of incurable lives is better than the loss of all of those victims.
As a result, it seems that the only people who find it worthy to invest in these thugs are inexperienced individuals or attorneys who profit by defending them over and over in appeal after appeal.
Finally, let’s stop the madness. Enforce or reinstate, if your state repealed the death penalty, the elimination of these reprobates.

“They dress up like space aliens, all over the United States and all over the world, I told you, in horrible demon psychopathic outfits that make Pennywise look beautiful,” Jones said about drag queens. “And they show up and they have their way with your children.”
He then said that “only in America does it happen,” contradicting what he had just said about it happening all over the world, and then stood up and swung around with his chair, as if he were about to throw it.

Later in the broadcast, Shroyer said the book reading event was further evidence of Infowars’ broader theories about a liberal conspiracy to undermine American culture and replace it with a demonic culture.
“They want to sexualize the children. They want to bring this demonized culture, like literally Satanic culture, into the mainstream, have it at public libraries, and just pass it off as normal, accepted, this is just the norm now,” Shroyer said.

0001005,Why So Many #MeToo Feminists Are Hypocrites,"I am a little confused by the #MeToo feminists who have stood by for years while they knew the famous “casting couch” was in full swing — but wanted their time in the spotlight so badly they would endure whatever that entailed.
For any of the glittering elite at the Golden Globes the other night who acquiesced, kept silent, and went on to embrace fame and fortune, you made your choice. You chose to sell your soul to get a shot at the apple. For all who have joined the #MeToo movement while pulling in millions for film work and living lavish lifestyles while thousands of other young women were forced through those same doors of degradation, your protests sound a little hollow.
Check the roles you have played, and what those roles did to further the falsehood that women are sex objects and are only viable if they are “hot.” Every show on HBO and now Netflix has the required soft-porn and dehumanizing-to-women scenes that validate it and put it on the level of “acceptable art.” All involved are congratulated and given little blocks of Lucite with inscriptions verifying that yes, indeed, they took part in the degradation of women. And it is all caught on film.
[lz_ndn video=33408813]
For decades the feminists have claimed that women are like men and have the same sexual drives and should have the right to satisfy those desires in the same way they have seen men do for years. They desired to embrace the worst elements of men while denying that which sets all women apart; they used to be worthy of the pedestals men would create for them.
Just that concept alone was so disgusting for feminists that they moved to crash the pedestals, streak naked on campuses, burn bras, practice free love and ultimately protest to have the right to kill the offspring of those unions. Yippee, women. You “became” men. You insisted you be treated like men — and oh, that you were tough enough to take it. But if someone brushes against your backside, you cry.
By now, declaring that all unwanted touching, comments, looks, or even gestures should be reason enough to burn all men at the stake, you have declared your feminist movement a complete and total disaster. You are not real feminists because you didn’t go into the director’s office prepared for what you knew was going to happen.
You wanted that position so badly, you would do anything — even pose nude in your hero’s porn mags. It was an honor that women would seek to be in the centerfold of Playboy. It was an icon of women power — or so you thought. It was men laughing all the way to the bedroom after they convinced women it would empower them.
It’s like men yelling the loudest for the right of women to kill the product of their unprotected sex. No skin off the guy’s teeth. He’ll just jump in bed with another clueless bimbo who must have missed all the sex ed classes that started in kindergarten. And has anyone ever seen the books they use to teach kids about sex? Talk about dehumanizing and degrading.
Why weren’t the mothers screaming about that? Oh, wait — they were. They were called prudes — and they were dismissed by the educational powers that be as obstacles to progress. They applauded then-President Bill Clinton for what he was doing with Monica Lewinsky — and declared that that sex act kept girls from becoming pregnant.
Now that would be a legitimate #MeToo movement — all the young girls who were shamed by these classes, harassed by sexually active pubescents and made to feel abnormal if they joined abstinence groups and pledged to save themselves for marriage. They were mocked, ridiculed, shamed, and in some cases attacked and molested for their principled stance.
If these feminists really do believe that sexual harassment should not be tolerated at any level, then let’s see them move to take all sex out of every movie and TV show. Suggest that no act of violence against a woman should ever be tolerated. That would pretty much cut the run time of any “Game of Thrones” episode in half. It’s the women with money and power in the industry who tolerate all this.
Don’t just wear your sexy and revealing black dress, telling us you are so righteous on this issue — when most of you have committed the sin of allowing yourselves to be in a position for roles that show women in degrading or humiliating positions.
Talk is cheap — and as a woman, I have fought my whole life to speak for myself and let men know these women do not, and have never, spoken for me. They have tried to silence women like me because we don’t embrace their flawed political ideals. We don’t swoon at their leftist and social views while they claim to care about the poor but live in gated communities to protect themselves from them.
As a woman, I have fought my whole life to speak for myself and let men know these women do not, and have never, spoken for me.
Oh, sure, they’ll let them in to clean their toilets or drive their cars or cut their grass. But they have nothing in common with the poor; and those who came through that economic strata do everything they can to separate themselves from it while pushing failed socialist agendas on them.
These women are about groupthink, and the destruction of the individual. They will bully, with their magical pulpit, any who disagree or oppose them. They have great power and wield it effectively, which suggests that they always had the power to say no, to reject the job offer, to turn down the promotion or raise or to just say “buzz off” to any man who would say, “Yeah, that’s what I want to do to you.”
Here’s another good #MeToo movement. How many women have been dismissed, marginalized, disrespected and/or abused because of their political stance, their faith, their political party? Oh, let’s see: There was Sarah Palin, Phyllis Schlafly, Stacey Dash, Beverly LaHaye, Paula Jones, Ann Coulter, Kathleen Wiley, Condi Rice, Juanita Broderick, Dana Loesch, Mia Love, Kellyanne Conway, and Sarah Sanders. Anyone see a pattern here at all?
The #MeToo feminists embraced the women’s movement with glee knowing they were giving men more power over them — in so many ways. How many decades of Cosmo covers talked about women’s orgasms and the 10 billion ways to service or please a man? Seriously? These women can’t stand there pleading innocence and virtue when they were fanning the flames of sexual abuse. They started it — and now they want the rest of us to finish it while blaming all men for it.
Here’s how you finish it, Hollywood: Stop making movies that show women nude or having sex or being abused or having their tops ripped off, or whatever. You know the movies. And women in black: Cover up your breasts, stop strutting in the long-slitted skirts, pull up the plunge lines, and look up the word “modest.”
And men: There’s not much to say here — since men have only been doing what men have done since the beginning of time. The only difference is, the feminists gave them permission to do it.
So in the words of Barack Obama: “Get off your high horses.”

0001006,Patriot’s Blood Boiling over What Group of 8-Year-Olds Do When National Anthem Sounds,"A lot has been made of the national anthem over the past year. It all started when NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to kneel on the sideline during the song.
There were a lot of takes on both sides of the issue when it was fresh. Those who considered themselves patriots condemned Kaepernick’s behavior.
Others agreed with Kaepernick, and argued that was not protesting America itself, but the killing of unarmed black men across the country at the hands of police. Still, many former and current military members found it extremely disrespectful, no matter what message Kaepernick was championing.
The issue was so volatile that a lot of people think it cost Kaepernick a roster spot. His skill level may be higher than other backups across the league — the man played in a Super Bowl after all — but most owners don’t seem to want the extra media attention paid to a backup quarterback.
TRENDING:
Just because Kapernick isn’t in the league doesn’t mean the issue is over. Protests have been erupting in St. Louis after an officer was found not guilty of first-degree murder.
In Cahokia, Illinois, these protests prompted a team of 8-year-old football players to ask their coach about what was happening. When he asked the player why he thought people were protesting, the player responded by saying, “Because black people are getting killed and nobody’s going to jail.”
This prompted Coach Orlando Gooden to talk about peaceful protests, specifically related to football. He told his kids about Colin Kaepernick, and they responded by saying, “Can we do that?”
“I told them kneeling is a show of respect, not for those who broke boundaries — I support only peaceful protest — but for the innocent lives that have been touched by injustice,” Gooden told CBS. “I know some of the people talk and speak as if I told the kids to turn around and that. I didn’t.”
So, at the next game, the team all took a knee when the national anthem started. The parents of the team seemed to be on board, but not everyone felt that way.
Coach Gooden was hit with a wave of criticism from individuals and the media, saying that he was getting the children mixed up in something they didn’t fully understand. Brian Kilmeade of “Fox and Friends” even went so far as to say, “You’re never too young to disrespect the country.”
“What I teach my kids is love, integrity, honesty, fairness, respect and boundaries,” Gooden said. “As long as I have support of my parents and team, I’m perfectly fine, and I’m covered under the First Amendment to peacefully protest and assemble.”
All of this brings to mind a
When the team came to a rival school, they noticed there was no flag hanging. They grabbed their road-flag off their bus, and brought it to the field for the national anthem.
It was clear that this team understood the importance of patriotism, with one young man saying, “People die to protect their country and for the flag. People are disrespecting it all the time. It needs respect for the people who served the country and respect it.”

This truth is a harsh reality to face, but it’s what many people face each day. Tatyana Hargrove of Bakersfield, California, now knows this experience all too well.
Her heartbreaking story dates back to Father’s Day on June 18. The 19-year-old had been looking for a gift for her dad and was commuting back on her bike when she stopped for a sip of water.
Cops suddenly pulled over and confronted Hargrove, who they thought fit the description of an assailant who had reportedly been threatening people with a machete at a nearby store. Yet, the teenage girl didn’t match the description at all.
TRENDING:
The suspect was described as a 170-pound bald black man, aged 25 to 30 years old, and standing 5-foot-10. On the contrary, Tatyana was obviously younger, only stood 5-foot-2, and weighed 115 pounds.
During the exchange, officers started using aggressive force toward Hargrove — punching her in the mouth and
The attack hospitalized Hargrove. Additionally, no weapon was found on her and another, fitting suspect was later arrested.
Those same officers claimed it was mistaken identity, and yet, still charged Hargrove with “resisting … and aggravated assault on an officer.” Though the charges were dropped in August, Hargrove said the horrifying situation has made her “very paranoid.”
At the time, the NAACP’s Facebook video interview with Hargrove sparked the story. Now, the teen’s lawyer plans to seek compensation for physical and emotional injuries as well as lost wages and medical bills.
The story got back to Reddit users recently. A lot of commenters have been disgusted by the officers’ heinous actions.
“The ego is the only reason this incident happened,” a person wrote. “They knew it wasn’t her.”
“If cops suspected her, they should have started by asking her name and asking where she had been,” another said. “She would have told them her name, a girl’s name, and where she had been, and the cops could have moved on.”

0001008,Total number of Americans hurt in Cuba sonic attacks now at 25,"HAVANA, Cuba - According to sources familiar with the investigation, the number of Americans hurt in the alleged ""sonic device"" attacks has now reached 25, with some cases still pending ongoing testing, which could increase that number.
Sources who want to remain anonymous also revealed new information, telling Local 10 News reporter Hatzel Vela some of the incidents happened inside the embassy itself and at multiple Havana hotels, including the famous Nacional Hotel.
Up to this point, it has been reported victims were attacked near or outside their Havana homes, and one of the victims was attacked at Havana's Hotel Capri in the Vedado neighborhood.
In light of the attacks and ongoing investigation, the U.S. government is
On Sept. 17, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. government was reviewing whether or not to close down the American embassy in Havana.
""We have it under evaluation,"" Tillerson said. ""It's a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered.""
Sources told Local 10 News there is great discontent among the victims, who remain disappointed at the way the U.S. government handled the situation. Their major complain is that it took too long for high ranking officials in Havana and Washington to take action.
Over the weekend,
On Monday, the same day this story was published, Cuban state-run media printed a report in which an unnamed high-ranking Cuban official said Cuba does not have the sort of equipment that can be used for this type of attack.
The report adds Cuba doesn't have precedent with this type of attack.
On Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, while addressing the United Nations, once again
""Cuba has never perpetrated, nor will it ever perpetrate, actions of this sort,"" Rodriguez said. ""Cuba has never allowed, nor will it ever allow, its territory to be used by third parties with that purpose.""
Rodriguez added results from a preliminary investigation being conducted at the highest level of his government, which includes U.S. supplied data, up to this point shows no evidence that confirms a cause or origin related to the health issues being reported by the American diplomats and their families.
""The investigation to clarify this issue continues, and in order to be able to arrive to a conclusion, it will be crucial to count on the cooperation of the U.S. authorities,"" Rodriguez said. ""It would be unfortunate if a matter of this nature is politicized.""
On Sept. 15, The Associated Press reported
The way Castro responded surprised Washington, several U.S. officials familiar with the exchange told The Associated Press.
In a rare face-to-face conversation, Castro told U.S. diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis that he was equally baffled and concerned. Castro denied any responsibility.
The Cubans have allowed several investigative agencies, including the FBI, to spend time on the communist-run island and seek out answers.
In a country tightly controlled by the government, Americans investigators are still looking into whether a rogue faction in Cuba's security forces acted in defiance with the Castro government and possibly collaborated with another country, like Russia.
On Aug. 23, Local 10 News was the first media outlet in the country to report that
Canadian diplomats have suffered similar health problems and believe they were victims of similar attacks.
Back in August, Local 10 News also learned
There is a history of American diplomats being harassed while working in Havana, but never this severe.

0001009,Charlie Sykes: Conservative Media Provides Trump Supporters a ‘Safe Space’ From the Truth,"Mediaite columnist John Ziegler spoke to Charlie Sykes this weekend, and the conservative former radio host offered some mocking commentary about people who sacrifice their credibility to always defend President Trump.
During the 2016 election, Sykes was a vocal Never-Trump conservative who worried that Trump’s political rise would have dire long-term consequences for the GOP and the country at large. Sykes currently works as an MSNBC contributor, and he frequently criticizes
Sykes was on to promote his new book –
“I always knew there were the fringe characters, but I always believed the center would hold. I always believed we would ultimately do the rational, reasonable, principled thing, which was obviously, in retrospect, highly naïve.”
Ziegler and Sykes proceeded to discuss how conspiracy theorists and false demagoguery became mainstream viewpoints among the right. Skyes called this phenomenon a “cancer,” and he figured that Trump was able to normalize this and harness momentum by creating a campaign to mimic their rhetoric.
As the conversation continued, Sykes said it has become “so evident” conservative talk radio is a media business designed to pursue ratings over any ideological cause. He argued that people like Rush Limbaugh followed the shifting views of their audience, while Fox’s Sean Hannity is “dumb as a box of rocks” and one of those who would predictably cave in to Trump.
Eventually, Ziegler noted how often people tune out various media figures so they can pay attention to those who provide them with information that reinforces their worldview. Sykes agreed with Ziegler on this topic, and he compared the situation to conservatives who make fun of the idea of safe spaces.
“One of the things I realized was that the we conservatives have mocked the Left, I think legitimately, for safe spaces on university campuses. But the conservative audience really came to think of conservative talk radio, conservative media as their safe space, where they were not going to be confronted with the inconvenient truths, where they weren’t going to have to eat the broccoli. And anyone who fed them the broccoli, anyone who told them things that were disturbing or off message, got a lot of pushback.”
Sykes went on to lament that there were no more ideological standards or cultural footholds conservatives could rely on after falling in line behind Trump. He continued to express concerns that the current toxic political atmosphere will have negative repercussions around the country

The trickster posed as Anita Dunn and, after receiving an email from Weinstein in which he said he was sick and needed advice, replied that redemption could be found only if he was “willing to be as brave as those who found the strength to stand up to you.” The fake Dunn added that Weinstein needed to accept his fate graciously and not look to “discredit those who your behavior has affected.” Weinstein responded by saying he agreed.

Earlier this week, actress Rose McGowan
Considering McGowan — who has accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her — is one of the leading voices bringing the movie producer’s history of sexual misconduct to light, the suspension was a PR disaster for Twitter, to say the least. During today’s broadcast of Megyn Kelly Today, host Megyn Kelly lit into Twitter over its decision while pointing to her own history of being harassed online as proof the platform is inconsistent in applying its rules.
Highlighting that it is against the site’s rules to share phone numbers, Kelly noted that it also violates Twitter’s policy to incite harassment or to directly threaten people, jokingly asking the audience if they knew someone who did that in an obvious nod to the president. Kelly then flashed back to the election when she was targeted by Trump fans after her tough questioning of Donald Trump at a debate. This included Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen encouraging others to “gut” her.
“And I remember Twitter rushing to enforce its rules — no,” Kelly observed. “No, I don’t.”
She continued, “The point is not to re-dredge up that old dispute. It’s to say there’s an inconsistency here and who is Twitter kidding. Give me a break! Twitter, do better! Do better!”

At a town hall forum in New York Wednesday (in
“[I]t would pain all of us who were involved in that, and involved in investigations, if anyone at this organization, thought there was anything to be ashamed of in that decision making process,” Oppenheim said. “In fact, quite the contrary.”
Oppenheim said that Farrow was given resources and “many, many months” to report the story, but couldn’t bring it in for a landing. Last summer, Oppenheim said the network made the decision to pull the plug. But Farrow wanted to keep chasing it, so he continued the project for The New Yorker, where he eventually published his findings on Tuesday.
“The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us,” Oppenheim said.
On Tuesday,
“I walked into the door at The New Yorker with an explosive reportable piece that should have been public earlier and immediately obviously The New Yorker recognized that and it is not accurate to say that it was not reportable,” Farrow said. “In fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC.”
What remains unclear from the Oppenheim statement is why Farrow had to be taken off of the story during the summer. Was there another time-sensitive project that NBC needed him on? If they had invested “many, many months” on the Weinstein project, why completely take him off a story that he only planned to pursue elsewhere anyway? Questions certainly remain.

If they did– if they were saying, “This country sucks!” and disrespecting those who serve, I wouldn’t have a problem with Obama calling them SOBs. Unpatriotic losers are always SOBs in my book, and they always will be.
However, none of that applies to that situation, because love of country and respect for the military separated the Tea Partiers from the left. Therefore, SOBs would’ve been an inaccurate description.

0001017,Why Aren't Fully Automatic Guns Illegal? Las Vegas Has Extremely Permissive Firearm Laws,"On Sunday night,
Knowing that, people may wonder
Las Vegas and the state of Nevada have some of the most permissive gun laws around. Per Newsweek,
CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano told the outlet in the aforementioned article just how much damage weapons like that can do.
With such a horrific metaphor as that, it's hard to understand why fully automatic weapons, capable of so much damage, aren't illegal; the reason why is filled with so many loopholes that stop people from being safe if the weapon is in the wrong hands.
According to Daily Kos,
As is often the case after a gun-related tragedy like this,
As the situation in Las Vegas is an ongoing investigation, it isn't fully known why the shooter committed this act, or how many weapons and what type were used, nor who owned them and whether it was legally or not. All of that will be discovered in time, and it's best to not rush to judgement about whether Nevada's lax gun laws are to blame.
Still, the bottom line is that this event did start up the conversation once more, and also drew attention to the permissive laws on the books in Nevada. Perhaps this attention will push lawmakers to change things for the future. Or, maybe things will stay exactly the same.
But, as tiresome as this conversation can be — as it's been had so many times — it's an important one, and it will likely wage on in the days and weeks to come. Only time will tell if anything changes this time.

0001018,Hillary: “Shocked and appalled” by Weinstein … now,"Five days after the New York Times
JUST IN: Hillary Clinton releases statement on Harvey Weinstein allegations
— NBC News (@NBCNews)
Funny, Hillary Clinton
At least her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), has decided to declare Weinstein’s actions as “low-life behavior.”
“Hillary Clinton spoke for 90 minutes last night in California. But she didn’t mention Harvey Weinstein,” noted “New Day” co-anchor Alisyn Camerota. “Why not?”
“Look, you know, Alisyn, I’m nobody’s press secretary. I’m a U.S. senator and I’m telling you that sexual harassment is unacceptable. And I really think it’s low-life behavior,” Kaine said.
“Hillary Clinton speaks out against sexual harassment often. And I’m sure she’ll have a word to say when the time is right for her. But I don’t — you know, I’m not — I’m not anybody’s press secretary,” he added.
In case you were wondering, Kaine’s not a press secretary. But then again, Kaine says any leader should be out front in condemning Weinstein’s behavior:
“But you would recommend that she do that,” Camerota followed.
“Any leader, any leader should condemn this,” Kaine replied. “I mean, I have a 22-year-old daughter who is starting off, you know, in the work world. And I — when you read the stories about young women feeling pressured by somebody in a position of power, it makes you sick.”
That only amplifies Camerota’s point. Hillary had a 90-minute platform last night at UC Davis, hardly a bastion of counter-progressive thought. She couldn’t spare a single moment to say something like, “Hey, that Harvey Weinstein really turned out to be a pig, eh?” Nothing? So much for being a leader on women’s issues.
Not that Hillary was alone in her silence, at least up to now. Hollywood had mostly kept its mouth shut,
“It’s indefensible. That’s the only word you can start with,” he says. “Harvey’s admitted to it, and it’s indefensible. I’ve known Harvey for 20 years. He gave me my first big break as an actor in films on From Dusk Till Dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. We’ve had dinners, we’ve been on location together, we’ve had arguments. But I can tell you that I’ve never seen any of this behavior—ever.” …
This is an interesting moment. I’ve seen a lot of people, from Meryl [Streep] to Judi Dench, come out and say “holy shit,” and I think that that’s been the reaction by a lot of people in Hollywood. I don’t think that people were looking the other way; I think that people weren’t looking, because in some ways, a lecherous guy with money picking up younger girls is unfortunately not a news story in our society.
That’s … not entirely true, at least apart from Clooney himself. He seems to be pretty honest about his own perspective, but Jessica Chastain tweeted out yesterday that “the stories were everywhere” about Weinstein, and that she was warned about interacting with him at all:
I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an enviornment for it to happen again.
— Jessica Chastain (@jes_chastain)
When confronted about why Chastain didn’t blow the whistle herself, the answer didn’t impress her followers:
We hear this same story. Someone could have said something, but didn't bc reasons. Try 2 be as brave IRL as u are in the movies.
— Chica'sBailBonds (@irinamoises)
It looks like more of a case of not wanting to know for Clooney and others. Some other male stars have come forward today, including Ben Affleck, to denounce Weinstein but still claiming that they knew nothing. (Gwyneth Paltrow today hailed Brad Pitt for defending her from Weinstein two decades ago, but failed to note that it means Pitt knew and said nothing.) Clooney wants the DNC to cough up the cash now that everyone knows:
So when you find out how much worse it is than you thought, then it’s a news story. And this is a big news story now. And I feel very bad for all of the victims. I mean, cornering a young anchorwoman in the kitchen and jerking off into a potted plant? That’s not just some rumor about Harvey hitting on a woman; it’s disturbing on a whole lot of levels, because there had to be a lot of people involved in covering that up. That’s frustrating. If politicians knew these stories, I doubt they’d have been taking donations from him at the DNC [Democratic National Committee], and I hope that they will all give the money back or donate it to good causes.
Well, they are donating to what they see as good causes. Primarily, that means other organizations that
Other major beneficiaries of the Weinstein family’s largesse included almost $200,000 to the party’s Senate campaign accounts, $23,200 to its House campaign arm senatorial and $46,350 to Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential candidate, and to HILLPAC, a committee Clinton used to support other Democrats while senator. The figures include contributions attributed to Weinstein, first wife Eve Chilton and current spouse Georgina Chapman. …
The biggest beneficiary of funds from Weinstein and his family was the Democratic National Committee, which received about $800,000 in several of its accounts, according to the center, which analyzes political spending.
Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the party plans to give more than $30,000 to Emily’s List, Emerge America and Higher Heights. All three groups work to elect women to office. Hinojosa said the amount was for the funds Weinstein himself donated to the party during the 2016 campaign.
That’s not donating as much as it is money laundering. But at least they’re acknowledging their connections to Weinstein. The Leader of All Women couldn’t manage even that much, until media outlets began openly reporting her deafening silence.",unknown,True

The NRA this week tries to hide behind the Secret Service in order to escape claims of duplicity. But if the NRA were true to its values, wouldn’t it be demanding that guns be allowed into Trump and Pence speeches? And if not, why doesn’t the group withdraw its invitation?
Why is okay for the President of the United States to expect the safety of a gun-free environment when the NRA remains thoroughly committed to making sure Americans are confronted with gun-carrying citizens at grocery stores, gas stations, churches, and schools across the country?

Trump’s hypocrisy is blatant too. Why doesn’t he use his Twitter platform to publicly rail against protocols that ban guns at his events? Why doesn’t he categorically insists that when he address a crowd that it must be fill with firearms?
After all, if schools would allegedly be safer with lots of educators walking around with guns, that same logic should hold true for Trump events.
Also, remember that Trump has publicly bragged that if faced with a shooting, he’d be the first one to spring into action and

0001023,Nepal Police Arrest Seven Bitcoin Traders Despite Lack of Regulation,"Very few countries around the world effectively prohibit people from using Bitcoin. That doesn’t mean police can’t and don’t arrest individuals for their involvement in Bitcoin, though. In Nepal, at least seven people were arrested for being involved in cryptocurrency trading operations. It seems these trades were executed “without authorization”. That’s a strange explanation, considering Nepal doesn’t have any active cryptocurrency regulation whatsoever.
Being arrested while doing something that is not considered to be illegal will always raise more questions than answers. This is especially true when the activity being performed involves Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. As of right now,
This certainly begs the question as to why these people were arrested in the first place. According to a local source which contacted us by email, the arrests were made due to trading bitcoins “without authorization”. That is a rather interesting point of view put forth by the Central Investigation Bureau, as consumers in Nepal can’t ask anyone for permission when it comes to dealing with cryptocurrencies whatsoever. Nor should anyone need to do so in the first place.
While it is true a communist government won’t take kindly toward cryptocurrencies, arresting people without a valid reason won’t go over too well either. Regulatory guidelines are currently being worked out by the Nepalese government, but until those are in place, people are still free to do as they like. Or that is how it should be, at least, even though a communist government may have a very different opinion on these matters.
Local press reports
More broadly, it seems things are going from bad to worse in Nepal for Bitcoin users and companies as we speak. The impending regulation will assuredly introduce some changes over the next few months. It is certainly possible the government will crack down on cryptocurrencies as a whole and prohibit this new form of money from being traded altogether. Bitsewa, one of the few exchanges based in the country, has already shut down this week. The Nepalese version of LocalBitcoins isn’t all that popular either, which is somewhat surprising.
It will be interesting to see how the cryptocurrency sector develops in Nepal. Although this is not a major cryptocurrency hub by any stretch of the imagination, any form of regulation could set a dangerous precedent and stifle innovation. Whether or not Bitcoin will be banned altogether remains anybody’s guess for the time being. There are a lot of questions and very few answers right now; that much is certain.",unknown,False
0001024,India's Darul Uloom Deoband bans women from plucking their eyebrows,"The Darul Uloom Deoband in India issued a fatwa on Saturday banning women from plucking, trimming and shaping their eyebrows and also cutting their hair.
Darul Iftaa, which issues the Darul Uloom Deoband’s edicts, termed the act as “un-Islamic”.
A Muslim man from Saharanpur had asked Daul Iftaa on Islamic laws about eyebrow trimming and hair-cutting. “Do Islamic laws allow my wife to go for eyebrow plucking and hair-cutting?” the man asked Darul Iftaa.
In response to his query, the Darul Iftaa issued a fatwa saying that both the acts were ‘un-Islamic’ and banned under Islamic laws. “If a Muslim woman is involved in such acts then she is violating Islamic laws,” read the fatwa in Urdu.
Darul Iftaa clarified that there are 10 acts, including eyebrow plucking and hair-cutting which were banned for Muslim women under Islam. “Hair adds to the beauty of Muslim women and they should never get them cut, pointed the fatwa. Issuing the fatwa, Darul Iftaa head Maulana L. Sadiq Qasmi said, “Muslim women should stay away from beauty parlours as Islam does not permit them to have make-up that attracts other male members.”
He added that Muslim men too were not allowed to shave under Islam, trim eyebrows, wear make-up etc is.
“The trend of Muslim women going to beauty parlours has increased in the country. It is not a good sign and it should be stopped immediately. We should have issued a fatwa in this regard long ago,” he maintained.
Three years ago, the Darul Iftaa in London had conducted a detailed study on the contentious issue taking into account all schools of Islamic thought including Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi and Hanbali.
It also imposed a similar ban with an exception that Muslim women – married or unmarried – were allowed to remove facial hair if they develop moustache, beard or unwanted hair with permission from the husband or other male members.
“If there is no such defect then it is not permitted for a Muslim girl or woman to expose her eyebrows in front of non-Muslim men” the study concluded.
But most Muslim women have refused to follow the new fatwa. “They have no right to curtail our freedom. The world is changing. Muslim women are now allowed to drive in Gulf countries and they are issuing fatwas on eyebrow plucking. It is a shame on our Maulanas and scholars,’ said Sophia Ahmed.
Another woman, Safia Begum, said, “The fatwa also applies on Muslim men not to shave. Show me how many Muslim men in India are keeping a beard these days, except for these fake Maulanas. They should better watch ‘Lipstick under my burqa’ before issuing such ridiculous fatwas. Like me, the majority of the Muslim women in India will defy the ban.”

0001033,Trump says Comey knew he was going to exonerate Clinton,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to revive his long-standing complaint about the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, alleging that then-Director James Comey had protected the Democratic presidential nominee by prematurely “exonerating” her before the 2016 election.
“Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this — obviously a fix?” Trump wrote. “Where is Justice Dept?”
Trump’s latest online burst came in response to the FBI’s release of heavily blacked out draft statements from May 2016 by Comey in preparation for closing the Clinton investigation without criminal charges.
Trump tweeted that the draft statements, whose existence was previously known, show the FBI had exonerated “Crooked Hillary Clinton” long before the investigation was complete. He tweeted: “James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!”
In interview excerpts released in August by the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI officials said Comey and investigators had determined by the spring of 2016 that charges weren’t warranted, and had begun thinking of how the public should be informed of that decision. Clinton was interviewed by the FBI in early July, just days before Comey announced the investigation’s conclusion. That timing has prompted criticism that FBI leadership had prejudged the conclusion before completing the investigation.
When Comey announced the end of the case last year, he said the FBI had found no evidence that anyone intended to violate laws governing classified materials, which it considered a prerequisite for bringing a case. He said the FBI had thoroughly investigated the case for a year before deciding to conclude it.
“We went at this very hard to see if we could make a case,” Comey told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee days after announcing his recommendation that Clinton not face charges.
Trump, as both a candidate and now president, has long complained about the FBI’s handling of the email case, though his criticism has varied.
He initially cited Comey’s actions in the investigation as a basis for Comey’s firing in May, though Trumo later acknowledged that he was determined to replace the FBI director even without the recommendation of the Justice Department.
The president complained again after Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released excerpts of interviews with FBI officials close to Comey. Those interviews showed that draft statements to close out the Clinton investigation had begun circulating among a tight circle of FBI officials in the spring of 2016.
The interviews were conducted by officials from the Office of Special Counsel who were trying to determine if Comey’s actions had violated a federal law that bars government officials from using their positions to influence an election. That investigation was closed following Comey’s firing by Trump in May.

0001035,The GOP Tax-Pocalypse: Trump Shows GOP That the Truth is Now Irrelevant to the Republican Base,"Republican senators know this tax bill will be disastrous. But they all are falling in line.
When Barack Obama became president in 2009, he called together all the opinion leaders in Washington and announced that he was planning to propose a Grand Bargain that would include a cut in ""entitlement"" spending in exchange for the Republicans agreeing to allow the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans to expire. It had progressive Democrats in a state of agitation, feeling that the president was selling out the signature achievement of the New Deal for a temporary tax hike.
The Tea Party right refused to take yes for an answer. The Democrats were offering to take the heat and cut those hated ""entitlements,"" yet the far right couldn't bear raising taxes on rich people. Silly Tea Partyers, didn't they realize that they were walking away from a great deal?
It turns out they were biding their time until they held all the levers of power again so they could slash taxes for the wealthy, raise taxes on everyone else and institute ""triggers"" to cut vital programs as soon as their deep cuts start to raise the deficit, as they inevitably will. Why take half a loaf when you can hold out and get the whole bakery?
They even did a trial run in one of the ""laboratories of democracy"" to prove to everyone how slashing taxes on the wealthy and cutting all those ""entitlements"" that encourage dependency will boost growth dramatically and make everybody richer, happier and more successful. This was what we might call Sam Brownback's ""Make Kansas Great Again"" plan, which
“It was supposed to increase the GDP, and it didn’t. The feds will have that same problem,” said state Senator Jim Denning, a conservative who originally supported the tax cuts. In a phone interview, Denning told me he had done his own economic modeling in 2012 and “proved to myself that the tax cut would work.” But the new policy did not prevent a rural recession in Kansas or a dip in its oil-and-gas business. “It generated hardly any measurable economic activity,” Denning said. By the beginning of this year, he had changed course and voted along with Democrats and a coalition of Republicans to reverse most of the cuts, erasing Brownback’s economic legacy.
Donald Trump generously relieved Kansans of Brownback himself, by nominating him to be the ambassador-at-large for ""international religious freedom."" He has not yet been confirmed.
Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, has been getting an earful from his constituents who are gobsmacked that he is planning to vote to do to the whole country what they did to their state. The Kansas City Star editorial board
Sadly, that's unlikely. Certainly Sam Brownback won't be issuing the warning. He's in Washington this week trying to push through his confirmation -- and
Yes, guys. I'm aware of what happened in Kansas. Here's our story from last year:
Surely the Republicans all know this. Moran even admitted that Kansas is ""discussed"" in Washington, one assumes as a cautionary tale. And yes, the federal government is not like a state for a hundred different reasons, which makes it unlikely that the consequences would be exactly the same. Nonetheless, it's patently obvious that this tax plan will be a disaster on a national scale, probably resulting in some kind of crisis these same Republicans will then insist requires deep austerity measures to fix. That's the game as it's been played for 30 years, and it's always worked out fine for them. They cut taxes on the rich and the economy eventually goes to hell, at which point Democrats are voted in to clean up the mess, and the GOP insists on spending cuts to vital programs to pay off the debt they incurred with their tax-cutting spree.
Unlike in the past, these tax cuts are extremely unpopular.
It's hard to know. It's almost as if congressional Republicans are on autopilot, unable to exercise free will. Many of them, like Moran of Kansas, know very well that this plan is an utter disaster that will result in higher taxes for everyone but the top 1 percent, along with the degradation of important programs like Medicare, all of which will be used against them in upcoming elections. If I had to guess, I'd say they are simply mesmerized by what Trump has been able to do.
All week long we've been reading stories about how he is creating his own reality, unmoored from facts and truth. People are whispering about the 25th Amendment and wondering if the president of the United States might actually have a breakdown. But these GOP officials watched Trump give a speech in Missouri on Wednesday, where the crowd cheered wildly while he claimed that his plan has wealthy people like himself complaining about having their taxes increased so ordinary people can have a big tax cut.
Republican senators all know that's a brazen lie. It is literally the opposite of the truth. But they see those Trump voters believing every word he says, and they understand that the truth is now irrelevant to the Republican base. All Trump's supporters want is to see their hero win. If he loses yet again because the Republican Congress fails to deliver a bill for him to sign, members of that Congress know there will be hell to pay.
Republicans are happy to pass a tax cut, of course. It's what they live for. But this is a Kansas-level economic debacle in the making, and they are not stupid enough not to understand that. They're betting that their seats are safer if they go along with Trump's magical thinking than if they stay in the real world. After all, the Republicans have been lying almost as much as Trump -- about almost as many things -- for a long time. This time they've decided to hold their collective breath and dive down the rabbit hole with him. Maybe some of that Trump Teflon will rub off on them.

On Tuesday,
“This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME,” Crews began.
He recounted an encounter that took place last year at a function where “a high-level Hollywood executive came over to me and groped my privates.”
“Jumping back, I said, ‘What are you doing?!'” Crews reacted. “My wife saw everything and we looked at him like he was crazy. He just grinned like a jerk.
The Brooklyn Nine-Nine star initially thought of taking actions into his own hands:
I was going to kick his ass right then — but I thought twice about how the whole thing would appear. 240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho’ would be the headline the next day. Only I probably wouldn’t have been able to read it because I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN JAIL. So we left. That night and the next day I talked to everyone I knew that worked with him about what happened. He called me the next day with an apology but never really explained why he did what he did.
“I understand and empathize with those who have remained silent. But Harvey Weinstein is not the only perpetrator,” he continued. “Hollywood is not the only business [where] this happens, and to the casualties of this behavior — you are not alone. Hopefully, me coming forward with my story will deter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless.”

So suggests Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” the book rush-released today that has, according to current White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, made President Trump “furious.” The president tried and failed to block the book’s release.
Wolff writes that conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, right-wing provocateur Ann Coulter and Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo were all considered for the job.
“This was television, the president-elect said, and it ought to be a good-looking woman,” Wolff wrote in a parenthetical.
But he added: “When none of these ideas panned out, the job was offered to Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, who turned it down.”
Carlson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
Maybe it was for the best. Yes, some Trump insiders wanted a star. “But there was a counterview,” Wolff wrote. “The press secretary ought to be the opposite of a star. In fact, the entire press operation ought to be downgraded. If the press was the enemy, why pander to it, why give it more visibility? This was fundamental [Steve] Bannonism: stop thinking you can somehow get along with your enemies.”

0001049,"1,000 leads later, authorities still stumped by Vegas gunman","LAS VEGAS (AP) — More than a week after the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history investigators are stumped about the key question: What led a 64-year-old high-stakes gambler to kill 58 people and wound hundreds of others at a country music concert?
It’s an answer they may never find.
The FBI and Las Vegas police have sorted through more than a thousand leads and examined Stephen Paddock’s politics, finances, any possible terrorist radicalization and his social behavior. By Monday they had repeatedly searched his homes and interviewed his brother, girlfriend and others he’s done business with.
But the typical investigative avenues that have helped uncover the motive in past shootings have yielded few clues about Paddock, a professional gambler who spent nearly every waking hour playing video poker at casinos. That closeted existence has covered the trail for investigators.
“This individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event and it is difficult for us to find the answers to those actions,” Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Monday, conceding he’s frustrated.
The FBI has brought in behavioral profilers as they continue questioning Paddock’s live-in girlfriend, Marilou Danley, about his gun purchases and what she may have noticed about his behavior, Lombardo said.
Paddock had stockpiled 23 guns, a dozen of them modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon inside his 32nd-floor Mandalay Bay hotel room, where he busted out two windows before opening fire on the crowd.
The sheriff changed the timeline of the shooting Monday, explaining that a security guard in the hotel’s hallway responding to a report of an open door heard drilling from Paddock’s room. Paddock, who had installed three cameras to monitor the approach to his suite, opened fire through the door, spraying 200 shots down the hall and wounding the guard, who alerted other security officials.
A few minutes later, Paddock began the 10-minute attack on those on the ground.
Previously the sheriff had said the guard’s arrival in the hallway may have caused Paddock to stop firing. He said Monday he didn’t know what prompted Paddock to end his deadly gunfire.
The gunman had shot at aviation fuel tanks, stocked his car with explosives and had personal protection gear as part of an escape plan, authorities said Monday.
Paddock’s life has remained somewhat of a mystery and most people who have interacted with him said nothing really stood out about him.
“It’s his actual normalcy that makes him a fascinating study,” said David Gomez, a former FBI profiler.
The small group people who knew Paddock well has said the one-time IRS agent and the son of a notorious bank robber did essentially nothing except gamble, sleep and travel between casinos. Investigators are sifting through every piece of Paddock’s life from birth to death, Lombardo has said.
“Every piece of information we get is one more piece of the puzzle,” the sheriff said Monday.
Experts say it is extremely unusual to have so few clues more than a week after a mass shooting. In past mass killings or terrorist attacks, killers left notes, social media postings and information on a computer, or even phoned police.
In this case, there was no suicide note, no manifesto, no evidence the gunman was motivated by any ideology and Paddock has no clear presence on social media, police said.
The FBI is working around-the-clock and a “comprehensive picture is being drawn as to the suspect’s mental state,” the sheriff said. Though at this point, they haven’t found any one particular event in Paddock’s life that triggered the shooting, he said.
Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg said Monday an autopsy was done but could not discuss results of whether it yielded any clues to Paddocks actions.
But even as investigators work to try to figure out what might’ve led Paddock to commit the shooting, there may never be a clear answer.
“Sometimes there isn’t an understandable explanation for why someone commits a horrific crime,” Gomez said.
What has become very clear to investigators is that Paddock meticulously planned the attack. He requested an upper-floor room overlooking the country music festival and set up cameras inside and outside his room to watch for approaching officers.
After the shooting, police found a piece of paper on a nightstand in Paddock’s hotel room that contained a series of numbers that helped him calculate a more precise aim, accounting for the trajectory of shots being fired from that height and the distance between his room and the concert, a federal official said. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the details of the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
In not leaving behind an easily accessible manifesto, Paddock defied societal expectations that mass murderers will want their disturbed motives known to the world, said Clint Van Zandt, a former FBI profiler and hostage negotiator.
“The reason you want to engage in an attack is you want to be promoting your extremist ideology — you want publicity,” said Erroll Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California. “You want people to be afraid of what you believe and what you do.”
But although most killers may want to take credit for their act, Paddock might have reveled in the riddle he’s presented for investigators, Van Zandt said.
“He may even find some solace knowing that, ‘I’ve left so few footprints, they’re going to have a helluva time figuring out who I am.’ And that, in his challenged mind, might bring him a terrible level of satisfaction,” he said.
Despite the absence of easy answers, investigators may still be able to fill out a portrait of Paddock’s mindset in the coming weeks, Van Zandt said.
“Instead of a eureka moment, I think what investigators are doing is they’re putting an ounce of information at a time on the scale,” he said.",unknown,False
0001050,How Trump Is Preparing for War,"What’s worrying isn’t that Trump is now getting advice about policy from fanatics like John Bolton and Lawrence Kudlow. Trump has never cared about policy.
The real worry is that – with Robert Mueller breathing down his neck, and several special elections suggesting a giant “blue wave” in November – Trump is getting ready to do whatever it takes to maintain his power, even if that requires fanatical policies.
Trump is preparing for an epic war over the future of his presidency. This has required purging naysayers from his Cabinet and White House staff, and replacing them with bomb-throwing advocates like Bolton and Kudlow.
Fox News is preparing for the same war, and has made a parallel purge – removing Trump critics like George Will, Megyn Kelly, and Rich Lowry, and installing Trump marketers like Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin, and Sebastian Gorka.
Trump and Fox News are also approaching the war with the same story.
Some of it is by now familiar: Liberals have opened America to hostile forces – unauthorized immigrants, Muslims, Chinese traders, criminal gangs, drug dealers, government bureaucrats, coastal elites (Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi), North Korea, Iran, and “political correctness” in all its forms.
Trump intends to protect America from these forces.
The new twist to the story– requiring the recent purges and a united front – is that these forces are conspiring with the FBI to oust Trump from the presidency.
The membrane separating Trump’s brain from Fox News has always been thin, but in coming months it’s likely to disappear entirely.
We all know Trump watches an inordinate amount of Fox News, beginning in the wee hours with “Fox and Friends,” which provides much of the fodder for his morning tweets.
Trump has made John Bolton his National Security Advisor not because Bolton has valuable insights about foreign affairs, but because Bolton – for years, an on-air fixture on Fox News – is a showman who knows how to sell big lies and crazy ideas, and thereby help Trump in the looming battles.
As undersecretary of state for arms control in the Bush administration Bolton did more than anyone else to market the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. During his year and a half at the United Nations, Bolton was so outspokenly critical of the organization that he gained the devotion of xenophobic conservatives.
It hasn’t hurt that Bolton has sucked up to Trump since then. Describing Trump’s address last year to the United Nations, Bolton swooned “in the entire history of the United Nations, there has never been a more straightforward criticism of the unacceptable behavior of other member states.”
Kudlow isn’t a Fox News pundit but he’s been the next best thing – a rightwing CNBC contributor known for his sharp wit and salesmanship.
Several other cable news anchors and pundits are already in the Trump administration or will soon be, providing additional ammunition for Trump’s pending war.
“He’s looking for people who are ready to be part of that television White House,” says Kendall Phillips, a communication studies professor at Syracuse University. “This is the Fox television presidency all the way up and down.”
How can a television presidency be dangerous? Because it is solely about marketing Trump. Its only goal is to win. It is unconstrained by truth, reason, or the Constitution. It doesn’t give a fig about the public.
When the occupant of the White House and the sycophants surrounding him are prepared to do and use anything – including trade wars with China and possibly hot wars with North Korea and Iran – to win a political war at home, nothing and no one is safe.",unknown,True

Steve Bannon — the loathed architect of President Trump’s alt-right hate machine, Breitbart lies, racism, misogyny and Twitter thug troll factory — is banished to political Siberia. It was swift and decisive.
Bannon is a deplorable human being who has no business being in a position of power or having the ear of any lawmaker. But as deplorable as he may be, his destruction by Trump and the sycophantic army Bannon helped incubate should frighten every American. Why? Because it’s not why he was taken down and kicked to the curb.

At Breitbart, Bannon created an online haven — a fertile safe space — for white nationalists and anti-Semites. Then he mobilized them behind a reality show host/failed casino owner/conspiracy theorist buffoon who won the GOP presidential nomination, largely because his outrageous clown show was ratings gold.
Many right-wing media figures, authors and commentators had made their fame and fortune with a Clinton in the White House. They likely wanted a repeat of that success and no doubt believed a Trump nomination ensured a Hillary Clinton win. I’m guessing more than a few publishers have a stale anti-President Hillary book proposal or two gathering dust in a drawer.
Bannon openly campaigned to tear down American institutions, the Republican Party and the government. His white nationalism was first ignored, then tolerated and even welcomed by some. When Trump brought him to the White House as a top aide,

Let that sink in for a moment. When Bannon promoted white nationalism, misogyny, an accused child molester, severe online bullying and conspiracy theories, he was a king to the right-wing media, Trump and most of the Republicans in Congress. But when he dared to tell the truth, when confirmation from an insider could help save the country from the danger, Bannon was cut out like a member of Tony Soprano’s “family” who turned state’s evidence.
It’s one thing for Trump to cut off ties to Bannon. But the wholesale embracing of Bannon’s political slaughter by conservative institutions for this, rather than for his past ugly sins, is quite another.
Finally, dropped by the Mercers, and by extension and formally by Breitbart, Bannon is now a man without a country, friends or home. That conveys an ominous message: Do not criticize this American president or you will be destroyed.

POLICING THE USA: A look at
It doesn’t matter who is the target, or that our disgust toward the likes of Bannon is appropriate and well-earned. The swiftness and robot-like precision with which Trump’s allies dislodged their lips from Bannon’s MAGA derriere, so they could effectively reach for their shivs upon orders from Trump, is chilling.
Not one White House staffer has publicly questioned whether Bannon’s words rang true. Not one Republican senator has suggested publicly that perhaps we should pay heed to Bannon’s words to Wolff. No one at Breitbart, or the Mercers, or the Republican National Committee or even Bannon’s Gilligan to his Skipper, Corey Lewandowski, seems curious about what Bannon said — and if it’s true, what danger the country may be in. The only concern is to protect and cover for Trump at all costs.
Even so, Bannon and others who “know too much” can be dangerous to a president with a few too many secrets. Trump would be wise to heed this advice: Never put anyone in a position where they’ve got nothing left to lose.

0001054,Robert Mueller’s CNN-Inspired Halloween Party,"CFP’s Sunday prediction for Monday, Oct. 30: Robert Mueller’s CNN-touted Indictment Party, like Hillary Clinton’s 2-minute Election Night Fireworks Display, will not, as planned, light up the sky.
Clinton’s plan to light up the sky over NewYork City on election, like her media and poll promised presidency, never happened.
Dittos are on the way for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s first indictments tomorrow. All of the pumped up CNN hype notwithstanding, there’s a general lack of public interest in his charging Trump Russia colluders because Sean Hannity ’s question is the one foremost on the minds of millions: “When will @HillaryClinton be indicted?”
‘Wake us up when it’s over, Mr. Mueller’ seems to be the prevailing sentiment of half an entire nation.
CNN has been holding the Internet world in suspension over the weekend with a “scoop” spoon-fed to them by “anonymous sources” within the Special Counsel Team.
Putting their bragging rights on full display, the network claimed in a Friday night bombshell: “As of publication, every other media outlet reporting the story is reporting it back to CNN.”
According to their latest arrogant stance, the entire media died leaving CNN boss.
Only the anti-Trump-crazed CNN would call Mueller’s being prepared to make first charges on the year-long hunt for Trump campaign Russian colluders, “a scoop”.
Readers and viewers call it what it really is: “spoon-fed propaganda fed by “anonymous sources” in the Deep State to what has long been their favorite “news” outlet.
All CNN heads under laurel wreaths must be getting more than a tad itchy by now.
The only media outlets in discernible “rah-rah” CNN mode are those who have been advancing the Russians-stole-the-election-from-Hillary conspiracy for the past year.
The Mueller investigation is based on a salacious, unproven dirty dossier by Spy-who-cut-and-run Christopher Steele. Steele, who went underground, leaving his cats with a neighbour when his cover was blown, raked in mega bucks for a made-up story, and would likely still be cashing FBI checks if his cover hadn’t been blown.
Part of his leaked dossier purported that Donald Trump hired a pair of prostitutes to soak a bed Barack and Michelle Obama once shared at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow, Russia, in urine.
Throwing the Obamas into the picture was bound to bring progressive/left hyenas out on the stampede.
Now that the Washington Post outed Clinton and the DNC as the main principals behind the dossier, accusations are boomeranging back to the Republicans as its originators.
“In October 2015, during the Republican primary campaign, the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website primarily funded by Republican donor Paul Singer, hired the American research firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. For months, Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on his business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016, the Free Beacon stopped funding research on him. (Wikipedia)
‘“Shortly after the presidential election, Senator John McCain, who had been informed about the alleged links between the Kremlin and Trump, met with former British ambassador to Moscow Sir Andrew Wood. Wood confirmed the existence of the dossier and vouched for Steele’s “professionalism and integrity”. McCain obtained the dossier from David J. Kramer and took it directly to FBI director James Comey on December 9, 2016”. (Wikipedia)

“Following Tuesday’s news, Clinton’s former campaign press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted that “if even a shred of that dossier ends up helping Mueller, it will prove money well spent.” (
Meanwhile,
It took four—count ‘em— four CBS News’ reporters to file the eight-paragraph “report”: “Andres Triay, Paula Reid, Pat Milton and Clare Hymes contributed to this report. “
But you can get the entire CBS storyline in its first paragraph:
“The federal grand jury being used by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election has approved the first charges stemming from the investigation, sources tell CBS News.” (Italics CFP’s).
“The indictment is currently under seal but is expected to become public as early as Monday. The nature of the charges is not clear, nor is the identity or number of individuals targeted. (CBS)
“CNN first reported the approved charges Friday night.”
Like CNN, the CBS story is based on “anonymous sources”.
Peter Carr, a spokesman in the special counsel’s office, wasn’t the source, as he declined to comment.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wasn’t a source as his office declined to comment on whether he was briefed on possible charges.
It is Rosenstein who oversees the Mueller probe at the Justice Department.
Don’t CNN and CBS know that the public at large know that stories citing “anonymous sources” are not stories at all, but only strategically planted propaganda?
Incorporate that into your forthcoming book, ex-FBI Director Jim Comey.
Targets of Mueller’s keystone cop investigation to date include former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, among others.
Like the rest of us, they will be kept in the dark until Monday.
Investigative journalist Carl Bernstein, out in the arid news desert since Watergate, flew solo on speculation:
“Bernstein: Trump Officials Facing ‘20 to 40 to 50 Years for Whatever These Crimes Are’ : (
Carl Bernstein, along with Bob Woodward, one of two Washington Post reporters, who broke the Watergate scandal, should be walking proof of how far downhill investigative journalism has gone since the long ago days of ‘Deep throat’.
In a single paragraph Bernstein twice misused the word ‘perspective’ for ‘prospective’:
“Bernstein: Trump Officials Facing ‘20 to 40 to 50 Years for Whatever These Crimes Are’ ‘Mueller wants to send a signal to other perspective defendants’. (Grabien)
“BERNSTEIN: “There’s one other aspect of this and that is that it’s very possible, and it’s been suggested to me by some of the lawyers involved, that Mueller wants to send a signal to other perspective [sic] defendants. If this person who has been indicted, or persons, are facing 20 to 40 to 50 years for whatever these crimes are — related to collusion or not — there may be others who are subject to similar charges who have further knowledge about dealings with Russia. And so it may be aimed at these perspective [sic] indictees as well, not simply this person or persons who they want to flip. So there are a lot of intentions that the special council is trying to convey here I suspect.” (Grabien)

Dittos are on the way for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s first indictments tomorrow. All of the pumped up CNN hype notwithstanding, there’s a general lack of public interest in his charging Trump Russia colluders because Sean Hannity ’s question is the one foremost on the minds of millions: “When will @HillaryClinton be indicted?”
‘Wake us up when it’s over, Mr. Mueller’ seems to be the prevailing sentiment of half an entire nation.
CNN has been holding the Internet world in suspension over the weekend with a “scoop” spoon-fed to them by “anonymous sources” within the Special Counsel Team.
Putting their bragging rights on full display, the network claimed in a Friday night bombshell: “As of publication, every other media outlet reporting the story is reporting it back to CNN.”
According to their latest arrogant stance, the entire media died leaving CNN boss.
Only the anti-Trump-crazed CNN would call Mueller’s being prepared to make first charges on the year-long hunt for Trump campaign Russian colluders, “a scoop”.
Readers and viewers call it what it really is: “spoon-fed propaganda fed by “anonymous sources” in the Deep State to what has long been their favorite “news” outlet.
All CNN heads under laurel wreaths must be getting more than a tad itchy by now.
The only media outlets in discernible “rah-rah” CNN mode are those who have been advancing the Russians-stole-the-election-from-Hillary conspiracy for the past year.
The Mueller investigation is based on a salacious, unproven dirty dossier by Spy-who-cut-and-run Christopher Steele. Steele, who went underground, leaving his cats with a neighbour when his cover was blown, raked in mega bucks for a made-up story, and would likely still be cashing FBI checks if his cover hadn’t been blown.
Part of his leaked dossier purported that Donald Trump hired a pair of prostitutes to soak a bed Barack and Michelle Obama once shared at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow, Russia, in urine.
Throwing the Obamas into the picture was bound to bring progressive/left hyenas out on the stampede.
Now that the Washington Post outed Clinton and the DNC as the main principals behind the dossier, accusations are boomeranging back to the Republicans as its originators.
“In October 2015, during the Republican primary campaign, the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website primarily funded by Republican donor Paul Singer, hired the American research firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. For months, Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on his business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016, the Free Beacon stopped funding research on him. (Wikipedia)
‘“Shortly after the presidential election, Senator John McCain, who had been informed about the alleged links between the Kremlin and Trump, met with former British ambassador to Moscow Sir Andrew Wood. Wood confirmed the existence of the dossier and vouched for Steele’s “professionalism and integrity”. McCain obtained the dossier from David J. Kramer and took it directly to FBI director James Comey on December 9, 2016”. (Wikipedia)

“Following Tuesday’s news, Clinton’s former campaign press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted that “if even a shred of that dossier ends up helping Mueller, it will prove money well spent.” (
Meanwhile,
It took four—count ‘em— four CBS News’ reporters to file the eight-paragraph “report”: “Andres Triay, Paula Reid, Pat Milton and Clare Hymes contributed to this report. “
But you can get the entire CBS storyline in its first paragraph:
“The federal grand jury being used by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election has approved the first charges stemming from the investigation, sources tell CBS News.” (Italics CFP’s).
“The indictment is currently under seal but is expected to become public as early as Monday. The nature of the charges is not clear, nor is the identity or number of individuals targeted. (CBS)
“CNN first reported the approved charges Friday night.”
Like CNN, the CBS story is based on “anonymous sources”.
Peter Carr, a spokesman in the special counsel’s office, wasn’t the source, as he declined to comment.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wasn’t a source as his office declined to comment on whether he was briefed on possible charges.

It is Rosenstein who oversees the Mueller probe at the Justice Department.
Don’t CNN and CBS know that the public at large know that stories citing “anonymous sources” are not stories at all, but only strategically planted propaganda?
Incorporate that into your forthcoming book, ex-FBI Director Jim Comey.
Targets of Mueller’s keystone cop investigation to date include former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, among others.

Carl Bernstein, along with Bob Woodward, one of two Washington Post reporters, who broke the Watergate scandal, should be walking proof of how far downhill investigative journalism has gone since the long ago days of ‘Deep throat’.
In a single paragraph Bernstein twice misused the word ‘perspective’ for ‘prospective’:
“Bernstein: Trump Officials Facing ‘20 to 40 to 50 Years for Whatever These Crimes Are’ ‘Mueller wants to send a signal to other perspective defendants’. (Grabien)
“BERNSTEIN: “There’s one other aspect of this and that is that it’s very possible, and it’s been suggested to me by some of the lawyers involved, that Mueller wants to send a signal to other perspective [sic] defendants. If this person who has been indicted, or persons, are facing 20 to 40 to 50 years for whatever these crimes are — related to collusion or not — there may be others who are subject to similar charges who have further knowledge about dealings with Russia. And so it may be aimed at these perspective [sic] indictees as well, not simply this person or persons who they want to flip. So there are a lot of intentions that the special council is trying to convey here I suspect.” (Grabien)

Uranium is, of course, crucial to the production of nuclear weapons, which both the U.S., and Russia, have in huge abundance. This makes the whole Uranium One scandal a major national security problem.
In 2010, even having all the above evidence, the FBI and the Department of Justice did nothing but continue to investigate. Four more years passed, until, finally, one of the Russian participants was charged and convicted of a single charge of money laundering for the scheme that stretched from 2004 to 2014. Another year passed before the DoJ finally issued a press release on the situation. Prominent FBI officials, and leading congressmen on the Republican side (which controlled the U.S. House beginning in 2011), were never fully briefed on the case.
You will never guess which prominent names were part of the FBI/DoJ investigation. Robert Mueller, who now serves as Special Counsel/Prosecutor of the Russian Collusion investigation, was the director of the FBI from 2009 through 2013. He had to know about the Uranium One investigation. James Comey, Mueller’s successor as FBI Director, took over in 2013, staying till he was fired by Trump earlier this year. He also had to know of the Uranium One investigation. Andrew McCabe, who was then an Assistant FBI Director but now is Deputy Director, led the Uranium One investigation on the FBI side, while then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, appointed to that position by President Obama, and who now serves as deputy attorney general under President Trump, led the prosecution team. As deputy attorney general, Rosenstein has the distinction of appointing Robert Mueller as Special Counsel for the Russian Collusion investigation after James Comey’s leaks persuaded Rosenstein
And, of course, Hillary Clinton, then-Secretary of State, and eventually the 2016 Democrat nominee for president, who the day after her unexpected loss to Trump
So, when it comes to the Uranium One scandal, we have here a situation where all these characters may have been implicated in a real Russian bribery scandal, largely unprosecuted – except one man – despite loads of evidence, which transferred U.S. uranium to Russian control. But, instead of suffering any penalties for their unwillingness to protect U.S. national security interests, these individuals have turned the tables, and are going after President Donald Trump for his supposed collusion with Putin to “hack” the election. All with virtually no evidence for the Russian Collusion investigation.
There is a name for such a sickness. In psychology, there is the idea of “projection.”

0001059,Why you shouldn’t purchase two one-way tickets to save money,"Many travel sites claim you can sometimes save money by booking two one-way tickets instead of a round-trip ticket. But is there a downside to this practice?
Sharon Sanborn recently discovered that the answer to that question is a resounding yes.
Sanborn’s case points to the fact that if you decide to try this “travel hack,” it is a bit of a gamble and you may end up losing.
Squaremouth helps travelers easily and instantly compare travel insurance policies from all major providers. Only companies that meet the strict requirements of Squaremouth’s Zero Complaint Guarantee are available on the website. Compare policies on
Buying two one-way tickets
“I purchased a ticket for my granddaughter on Delta with a return on United a week later,” she told our advocates in her
When an airline cancels your flight, it is perfectly reasonable to expect a refund for that flight. But there were multiple complications with Sanborn’s ticket, which ultimately prevented her from receiving reimbursement for that return segment.
First, she
Two different airlines
Next, she purchased an itinerary that Travelocity created by combining two one-way tickets on two different airlines.
The way Travelocity confirmed Sanborn’s reservation could give an infrequent traveler the impression of having purchased a single, contiguous ticket — if one part were to be canceled by the airline, the entire ticket could be refunded.
However, at the bottom of the reservation, Travelocity spells out the terms of the ticket and clarifies: “We have combined two one-way tickets to get the best deal. If you need to make changes or cancel, you’ll need to do it twice — once for each one-way ticket.”
Two separate tickets
What it doesn’t explicitly spell out is that if the traveler needs to cancel this nonrefundable ticket, two cancellation fees will be accessed. And if the airline cancels one of the flights, there is no policy or protection by which the traveler can ask for a refund of the other unrelated flight.
If Sanborn had purchased this ticket as a round-trip flight on the same airline, she would have qualified for a full refund of the cost of the ticket. Because she didn’t, she only received a refund of the canceled Delta ticket. She was then stuck with the nonrefundable return flight, which had a hefty cancellation fee.
The cancellation fee essentially made that one-way ticket worthless, and Sanborn lost several hundred dollars.
The bad news
In the end, we couldn’t help Sanborn recoup her losses. The way she purchased this ticket through Travelocity made it impossible.
You may find savings by booking two one-way tickets. However, before doing so, you should weigh the cost and benefits against the potential loss that could result. Because it’s a gamble that you may not win.

0001060,Does the U.S. President’s Dog Get Its Own Secret Service Agents?,"Ryan asks: If the president has a pet dog, do their bodyguards also watch over his dog like they do his family?
Even before the U.S. president is elected such, if they’re considered a “major candidate” for the job,
According to former Secret Service agent Dan Emmett, as noted in his book
Emmett put this little tidbit in a section of his book specifically dispelling myths about the Secret Service. This is a section that humourously enough also includes this gem of a supposedly widely held myth:
Myth: All women are attracted to Secret Service agents.
Emmett goes on to explain that the truth is actually that only “Many women are attracted to Secret Service agents…” (Presumably to ones called Dan Emmett most of all.) On top of this, he states that the life of a Secret Service agent includes a
never-ending string of temptations sometimes literally thrust into one’s face by women who are impressed by such things as men who protect the president. It can be almost frightening at times when seated in a bar, and a woman recognizes and agent she has just seen on television with the president. On more than one occasion, my shift mates and I had phone numbers and hotel room keys shoved into our hands or thrown to us while working a rope line with the president…. For the single agent, it was paradise; for many married agents, it was a constant struggle between good and evil, which was sometimes won and other times lost.
Back to literal dogs (as opposed to the cheating kind)- although the Secret Service isn’t obligated by any means to walk or take care of the president’s pet dog or cat (Emmett tersely claims that White House custodial staff do this), it doesn’t mean they don’t necessarily do it.
For example, Bo and Sunny, the pet Portuguese Water Dogs of the Obama’s, were often pictured being taken for a walk by some member of Obama’s protective detail. Given there were presumably other staff available for the task when necessary, we can only assume they did this because of scenarios like that the president was in the midst of doing so himself when called away for a moment (so they had to take over temporarily), and perhaps because they liked to walk the dogs, so weren’t quick to call other White House staff in. After all, it stands to reason that Secret Service agents who spend a lot of time around the president would occasionally grow fond of the president’s pets, assuming they liked the type of animal, and thus wouldn’t mind the occasional pet detail.
Said agents have also been known to do such things as a favor to the president. For instance, the Secret Service agents tasked with protecting Ronald Reagan after he left office occasionally ran around Reagan’s ranch with his dogs when the former President was physically unable to do so.
In all such cases, one would think, despite not being obligated to, they’d even potentially help protect the pet if necessary. Sure, maybe not protect them with their lives as they’re expected to do with the human members of the family, but presumably they’d give it their best go if someone tried to pull a canine assassination or the animal was going to be hit by a car or something. In fact, the Secret Service is known to actively take precautions to keep a president’s pet(s) safe at least in some cases, including things like muzzling their own attack and guard dogs when they’re around the pet(s).
And while Emmett never mentioned it, keeping track of the president’s more mobile pets must be somewhat of a priority given that presidential pets are generally given near total freedom to come and go as they please and have essentially unlimited access to the president. First Dogs then arguably have more power than most of the president’s own advisers, seeing as they can walk into his office any time and lick his face without upsetting him (something we presume only the First Lady, or certain interns of yore, could otherwise get away with).
Why would the Secret Service care what said animals get up to? This unscreened freedom of access is potentially a major security risk if the animal in question wasn’t being well kept track of. After all, someone could potentially get an explosive device or the like within a large enough dog (perhaps forcing or otherwise coercing them to swallow it or… you know, insert it into the other end). Beyond this, pathogens, toxic substances, etc. could be clandestinely planted on or in the animal’s fur in the hopes the president would soon after pet the animal.
So presumably the Secret Service keeps tabs on that it is at least somebody’s job to ensure the animals that have unrestricted access to the president and their family never ventures into unsecured locations or the like, even if it’s not the Secret Service’s job specifically to keep track of the animal(s). (And yes, very unfortunately so-called “suicide bomber animals” are occasionally a thing, one of the more famous cases of this being the sad tale of
On a lighter note, it should be noted that beyond having people wait on you paw and paw and having the ability to poop in the Oval Office, being the president’s animal also has other perks, including potentially a pardon from any crime you may commit.
You might think that last one sounds like a joke, but it’s only partially so. For instance, in 2008, President Bush’s beloved dog, Barney, bit two people- Heather Walker, public relations director for the Boston Celtics who got her wrist bitten, and Jonathan Decker, a Reuters reporter who got his finger nipped. Given the many and diverse microbial flora that call a dog’s mouth home (yes, contrary to popular belief,
For any other dog, such repeated behavior may well have resulted in it being put down, whether the owners wished it or not. However, even without the presidential pardon “get out of jail free” card, there are not many individuals who want to risk becoming near universally hated for pursuing the matter of getting the president’s dog “put to sleep”. Of course, if such a bitten individual tried, it would be interesting to see if the presidential pardon powers legally extend to animals… (And if you’re curious:

0001062,Hate On The Far Left Is Just As Dangerous As Hate On The Far Right,"In his
I share Davidson’s horror at the presence of figures such as Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka in the Oval Office. I worry deeply, too, about “alt-right” or “alt-lite” figures such as Richard Spencer.
And yet even with the increasing anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and other forms of hatred we are experiencing, I do worry more about Linda Sarsour than about most of the people on Davidson’s list — at least those involved in domestic American politics. After all, most of the list’s other individuals are known anti-Semites and bigots, fringe figures reviled by significant swaths of the American public.
The issue with Linda Sarsour is that she and many of her colleagues on the far left, including some in the LGBTQ community, are creating a false litmus test for progressive activism, one saying that if you are truly progressive you can’t be a Zionist. And, she is doing that with the aura of mainstream acceptability conferred by her Jewish allies and other prominent supporters for whom I generally have tremendous respect.
American Jews have been at the vanguard of progressive justice movements for more than a century. Being shunned by these movements because of their support for a Jewish state in Israel is devastating, particularly for those who have devoted countless time and energy to advocating for peace and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians. Sarsour and others present a false “either-or” choice for politically liberal Jews. When push comes to shove, many younger Jews could feel compelled to stifle their Jewish and Zionist identities in order to continue to be accepted in the social and activist circles they hold dear, whether advocating for LGBTQ rights, an end to police brutality and racial profiling, or preservation of reproductive choice. That is a much longer-term danger than any “alt-right” agitator is.
On a personal level, I was outraged and pained when Sarsour declared that it is impossible for a woman to be both a Zionist and a feminist. Really? How fortunate that I was unaware of this edict: From my college days organizing students to attend pro-choice rallies in Washington, D.C., to previously directing a Jewish women’s foundation that supports social change projects for Jewish and non-Jewish women and girls in Israel and the United States, my identities as a Jew, a progressive Zionist and a feminist have been seamlessly interwoven.
When did Linda Sarsour and other anti-Israel leftists become supreme gatekeepers, determining who may rightfully sit at the table of those who fight for justice and tolerance and equality? According to Sarsour, Zionism is never compatible with human decency, thereby ignoring that Israel itself was created out of the ashes of perhaps the worst genocidal crime in human history.
One just as easily could say that she is the one who should be dismissed from that table because of her willful denial that the essential human propensity toward anti-Semitism — a scourge that continues to flourish around the world and in our own backyards — created the urgent moral imperative to establish and sustain a Jewish state in our ancestral homeland in the first place. Jews have a rightful place at that table because of our identities as Zionist Jews, not despite it. We must raise our collective voice to stake this claim proudly and authentically. If we can’t get this message across, both to our own people and to our allies in the social justice arena, we will find ourselves ostracized from the very movements that we have so proudly championed and led for decades. In the process, we could potentially lose a chunk of younger generations of liberal American Jews. Hence, the “Sarsour hysteria” that Davidson finds so baffling.
Thankfully, we need not choose between combatting white supremacists and combatting those who deny Israel’s right to existence. We must do both, calling out hatred on both the far right and the far left. They are all equally deserving of our righteous anger.

There are so many fond memories there for both us from our childhood, as well as from our marriage. We’ve spent time with parents, friends and siblings enjoying all things magical, and experiencing a dream world that makes you feel like everything is going to be alright!
That being said, nothing was going to prepare us for how magical it actually was taking our own children and seeing the magic through their eyes!
We booked the Courtyard Marriot at the entrance to the park. We knew if we needed a quick escape, this was going to be crucial for us not having to walk too far. It was so perfect! Not only were the rooms spacious and clean, but the service was excellent! When we were being checked in, they found out we had quads. They immediately gave all the girls little whale stuffed animals from underneath the counter. Obviously they did this with all kids, but after a long morning drive, the girls certainly appreciated it! Also seeing our circumstance, they checked us in early and made sure we were all settled before heading over to park! Big shout out to Paige who took such great care of us! If anyone is looking for lodging, definitely recommend these guys!
Planning for the excitement was one thing, but I thought we were crazy if we didn’t think of the other end of the spectrum! Obviously taking four 2 year olds to Disneyland required some extra thought! Were they going to hold up in the summer weather? Did we need to pack extra diaper bags? Did we need to bring a cooler? Were they going to stay in their strollers? If not, would we physically be able to keep track of them? Would they like the rides? Are you starting to get a glimpse of all the worries we had going into the park?
Having Madison and Oakland on the trip with us really put most of these questions to bed! For instance they did want to get out of the strollers quite often, but having one adult per child really made this a non-worry issue!
By the time we got there on the first day, it was lunchtime. What else but corn dogs!
We kept them super hydrated throughout the day! What I love about Disney is you can get ice water at pretty much any of their restaurants free of charge! This was HUGE for us with the kiddos!
Although the weather was pretty warm, the stroller canopies and ice water on walks helped tremendously!
As soon as we took the kids on their first ride, I knew this trip was going to be a success! We actually started them out on an adult ride, Pirates of the Caribbean! This is one of our favorite rides, and our thought process was if they completely hated it, we could always move to the more kid friendly rides. But we didn’t even need to worry, because all 4 of them completely loved the ride; even to the point of singing “Yo-ho” for several minutes after the ride! They loved being on a boat as well. Even today when we talk about Disney asking them what their favorite ride was, we usually get a “boat” answer from one of them!
Everything else was downhill after the first ride! They absolutely loved all the amusement around them! We did Haunted Mansion, which they loved. I think my love of Fall and Halloween helped prepare them for this. The Dumbo ride, Pooh ride, and Pinnochio were all hits! That being said, I don’t think anything topped Small World. They fell in love with this ride, and we fell in love with their excitement and fondness for the ride. What once was Ashley’s least favorite ride, now became a family favorite!
Esme didn’t know what to think of the whale??
Are there 4 of them? This question never gets old! LOL.
#esmefaces
Evie’s face just kills me in this photo! Smile on demand!
The Carousel was definitely a highlight for the kids. They just lit up when they saw the horses, and wouldn’t stop chattering until we actually put them on one! They loved it!
The Disney Crew!
Pie faces!
Rides aside, I think the churros were the next big hit! The girls absolutely loved the Disney churros, but who doesn’t. Indie was particularly fond to them, just like daddy!
By the second day, we made our way over to California Adventure. The adults took turns riding the Grizzly Rapids, while the girls enjoyed snacks in the shade! The favorite ride over there had to be the Mater ride. The girls love all the tractors and trucks, to the point where they kept repeating those words for 20 minutes after the rides! Their excitement was electric, and contagious.
We ran into some celebrities while at the park! Anyone remember Magnum P.I.?
We enjoyed some restaurants and site seeing throughout both parks, and the girls overall were troopers for all the walking, warm weather, and schedule changes!
Mickey Mouse Donuts, “yes please”!!
On the second day, we wanted to make it to the firework show, so we started early, and planned a nap in the middle of the day. It went perfectly as we conquered much of Disneyland in the early morning, and then the girls took an incredible nap! Oak and Hugsy stayed an enjoyed the park while Mom an Dad worked during nap time. The girls slept til almost 5, which really was what allowed us to make the firework show at 930, and have the girls happy while doing so! It was a magical end to our Disney experience!
Best part of the trip came on the second day. Meeting Mickey and Minnie! The girls absolutely loved this experience, but their faces tell you that!
Overall, the girls were absolute troopers, not only for the 2 days at Disney, but for the entire California trip! We had such a wonderful experience watching them experience the magic of Disney for the first time! This was certainly the first of many more Disney trips to come!
Hope you guys enjoyed this blog. Many more adventures to come! In the meantime, please enjoy a few of my favorite all time blogs below!

0001064,Odell Beckham considering $100M insurance policy for 2017 season,"Even prior to suffering a potentially serious injury during a Monday night loss to the Cleveland Browns, New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was reportedly considering a $100 million insurance policy in the event contract talks with the team fell through.
New York Giants star Odell Beckham Jr. will consider acquiring a massive insurance policy – possibly for more than $100 million in injury protection – if he doesn’t reach a contract extension with the team before the NFL‘s regular season begins, two sources close to Beckham told Yahoo Sports.
The sources said Beckham’s camp explored injury insurance prior to Monday night, when a scary hit left the player with a sprained ankle in a preseason game against the Cleveland Browns.
“[If a deal isn’t done] by the regular season, he’ll take steps to protect himself. [But] a new deal is preferable to adding insurance,” one source said.
Beckham said earlier this offseason that he aspires to be the highest-paid player in the NFL — a demand that didn’t even cause a batted eye with Giants co-owner John Mara.
“He deserves to get paid, we’re going to pay him, it’s just a question of when we enter into the contract, and I don’t have a time table on it right now,” Mara said. “I just don’t think there’s any need to rush into it. He’s going to end up getting paid at some point.”
A policy in excess of $100 million could cost Beckham upwards of $600,000 for the year. However, given that he’s aiming for a contract larger than $100 million, it could potentially be a wise one-year investment for the superstar.
Beckham, who is not actively engaged in contract talks with the Giants, went down on Monday night with what initially appeared to be a serious knee injury. However, following x-rays and further examination, it was determined Beckham had merely suffered a sprained ankle.",unknown,False

Kirk is currently in the dog house, not even living with his wife. However, the source says he is doing everything in his power to get back into Rasheeda’s good graces. “Kirk is not giving up; he has a plan regardless of the paternity test,” the source revealed. “All he cares about is getting Rasheeda back.”
“He’s been bending over backwards to take care of the kids so she can work on Pressed (her Atlanta boutique) and on her new music. He’s an on-call babysitter 24/7. Even if she just wants to go to dinner or shopping he is right there. She’s taking full advantage of it and going out a lot. She goes for lunches and spa days and dinners and leaves him on daddy duty.”

The source adds that because they have overcome his cheating in the past, Kirk believes Rasheeda will eventually take him back.

They’re a team, they’re best friends, and he doesn’t see them ever really ending. She’s always forgive him in the past and Kirk definitely sees that happening again. In his mind, he and Rasheeda aren’t done. This is just a pause and a temporary bump that will make them stronger in the end.”

0001066,Failing the children of California,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:
At the start of each new year we’re subjected to a whole host of new laws. The modern liberal government, you see, imagines itself not as the champion of individual freedom but as Mommy and Daddy, a taskmaster charged with controlling your life. Most of the time, it makes everything, including our lives, worse.
Case in point: California. Completely at the mercy of the left, which now controls two-thirds of the state government, California serves as a living illustration of what the left really wants to accomplish. As of Jan. 1, that includes decriminalizing what is commonly called “child prostitution.”
They may not have technically legalized it, but decriminalizing the act per se will have the same results, while putting exploited children in even more danger.
First, let’s make one thing clear right now: There is no such thing as “child prostitution.” The fact is we’re dealing with the sex trafficking of girls and boys. This isn’t some horror reserved for Thailand or some other far-off place — it’s happening right here in the United States.
More than 1,000 children are arrested each year for prostitution, with estimates of sex trafficking involving 100,000 to 2.4 million children. Concerned Women for America reports, “The United States Department of Justice uses the number 293,000 as the estimate for youth ‘at risk’ of being commercially sexually exploited.”
The fact that these children are victims is not disputed, but what California has just done makes the problem even worse.
A revelatory op-ed in the Washington Examiner by Travis Allen, one of the few Republicans in the California legislature, declaring the state had “legalized” child prostitution, made waves and garnered much-needed attention to the issue.
Mr. Travis wrote, “Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. Yes, you read that right. SB 1322 bars law enforcement from arresting sex workers who are under the age of 18 for soliciting or engaging in prostitution, or loitering with the intent to do so. So teenage girls (and boys) in California will soon be free to have sex in exchange for money without fear of arrest or prosecution.”
So what can law enforcement in California do when they encounter a child selling themselves on the street for sex? The Sacramento Bee explains, “Commercially sexually exploited children, based on the bill’s analysis, may be taken into temporary custody ‘if the minor has an immediate need for medical care, or … is in immediate danger of physical or sexual abuse, or the physical environment’ or the child’s unattended status ‘poses an immediate threat to the child’s health or safety.’ “
The operative word here is, of course, “immediate.” But don’t worry — there is something the police must do. The Bee continued to defend the law by assuring readers, “Under the law, officers who encounter minors [selling themselves for sex] must report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect.”
That’s right. They must report it to a government agency.
So here’s the truth of the matter: This law tells the police there is nothing they are allowed to do with a child obviously engaging in an act against his or her will; an act that amounts to rape once the child sells himself or herself to the stranger looking for a child to purchase.
The obscenity of this law is clear: Not only does it tie the hands of law enforcement in removing the child from a threatening environment, it sends a message to the victimized children that their sex trafficker is in charge, that society accepts and allows what’s happening, and ultimately, there is no escape.
Mr. Travis notes, this vicious circle “translates into bigger and better cash flow for the pimps. Simply put, more time on the street and less time in jail means more money for pimps, and more victims for them to exploit.”
Why would California put sex-trafficked children in such danger by tying the hands of law enforcement when there are alternatives to treating them like criminals? Several states already have legislation that managed to recognize the victim status of the children without abandoning them.
Concerned Women for America reports, “New York and Washington State have laws that divert minors arrested for prostitution into services and rehabilitation programs at the discretion of the judge in New York and at the discretion of the prosecutor in Washington. … In Massachusetts, the law diverts minors found in prostitution into services and treatment but keeps the charges pending against them in place until they successfully complete the rehabilitation programs after which the charges are dropped.”
If you’re serious about saving children, you don’t limit what law enforcement can do, you expand their options while making sure children are treated as victims, while using the justice system as a way to remove them from their enslavement. Instead, the liberals who run California have just done the opposite, guaranteeing lives ruined while allowing an evil problem to continue virtually unchecked.

0001070,California Lt. Gov Gavin Newsome to NRA: “We ARE Coming for Your Guns”,"California’s Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom decided to commemorate the tragic Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 by telling the NRA that if they hurt anybody else, they’re coming for their guns.
Not would be criminals…but the NRA.
“It’s been 5 years since 20 first graders were shot dead at Sandy Hook,” wrote Newsom on a
Newsome then listed off the mass shootings that have occurred since that time.
Since then: – 14 killed in San Bernardino – 49 killed in Orlando– 58 killed in Vegas– 26 killed in a Texas churchEnough.
“We have a message for the NRA – National Rifle Association of America: If you hurt people, we ARE coming for your guns,” wrote Newsome.
The message was accompanied by a video featuring Newsome speaking on how the only thing more certain than another mass shooting is the “moral cowardice” of Republicans who ignore it.
Newsome then mocked the idea of thoughts and prayers, saying Republicans hide behind them while “plugging their ears with NRA hush money.” Turning to a solution, Newsome bragged that California has passed “proposition 63” and will force “convicted violent felons” to give up their firearms.
The video ends with Newsome saying voters need to tell Trump and Ryan to stop “praying for NRA dollars” and fix the gun laws. This is accompanied by a group of people picking up both politicians and manhandling them back into the capitol to presumably pass gun control laws.
I’m not going to mince words here. This video and the accompanying message is flat out stupid. It paints innocents as criminals, and conveniently doesn’t go into just what kind of law was passed with Prop 63.
For one, the NRA didn’t cause any of these mass shootings. None of the shooters that were involved were members of the NRA. Newsome’s warning that he would take away the NRA’s guns if they hurt anybody ever again is one of the most over-the-top and blatant lies ever leveled at the National Rifle Association.
He also managed to leave out the fact that the Texas shooting was stopped by a former NRA instructor.
Furthermore,
Once again, gun control politicians and advocates are punishing the law abiding for something the law defying did.
Oh, and speaking of laws, CONVICTED VIOLENT CRIMINALS ARE ALREADY NOT ALLOWED TO OWN GUNS. This has been a federal law for decades, and yet the left seems to believe that criminals are walking into gun stores, and walking out with enough firepower to conquer a small nation.
Newsome says in the video that the “coming for your guns” bit was a warning to “criminals,” but with the guy blaming the NRA and gun owners as the culprits in mass shootings, I’d like to know what his definition of “criminal” is.
In one Facebook post, Newsome…
-Exposed either his ignorance about our nation’s gun laws or his willingness to lie about them.
-Pegged an innocent gun rights organization and its members (millions on millions of people) for mass shootings they had nothing to do with
-Mocked how people give condolences for tragic events that happen to them, specifically those of the religious variety
-Accused Republicans of profiting off of the death of Americans with silence money given to them by the NRA
-Stood on the graves of the slain to do it.

0001071,Roofing Contractor Leaves Job Half Done When He Finds Out What Evil Work Business Does!,"You just have to admire a business that puts principles first above profit. In Wichita, Kansas that is exactly what happened. An abortion clinic there needed a new roof. They couldn’t get any contractors to do the work because well… they’re baby butchers. So, what do you do when you can’t get a contractor to ignore that you do infanticide for a living? Why, you lie of course. They pretended to be a real estate firm and got a contractor to begin work.
The roofing company got into the job, found out it was an abortion clinic and although they were out of pocket on materials and time, they packed up and walked off the job. Slow clap please. That’s a contractor I would hire in a heartbeat and pay extra for it. The roof was only half complete when they left and they didn’t look back once. No amount of money is worth helping a business that does evil work like that.
Farha Roofing found out about the true identity of the business thanks to Mark Gietzen and the Kansas Coalition For Life. The roofing company was reluctant to pull out because of the expense, but after enough complaints via phone calls, they packed it in and called it a loss. Inexplicably, they left foam insulation on pallets there as they left.
The abortion business has had to go out of town and out of state to get help from plumbers and electricians. It may be a very long time before that roof gets finished. Good. Gietzen plans to send letters to all the surrounding businesses to warn them that the abortion mill lies in order to retain contractors.
It’s pretty obvious that Wichita does not take kindly to abortion clinics. And if you have to lie to get people to help you, you are in the wrong business. Abortionists murder over 900,000 babies a year. It’s genocide and it is deeply depraved and evil. Abortion is not simply another form of birth control. It is the knowing murder of another human being. They tear apart babies who are innocent souls and cannot protect themselves.
Anyone who is against abortion should not have to take a job that helps them or promotes them, regardless of your religion. In my view, abortion is monstrous… it’s not only immoral and unethical, it is literally sacrificing babies on a bloody altar for profit. I applaud this roofing company for doing the right thing here and walking away. That building doesn’t need to be repaired… it should be demolished.",unknown,True

The operation caught Weinstein on tape admitting to groping a model, but the NYPD presented the evidence to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which determined the tape was “insufficient to prove a crime.”
In light of the New Yorker report, questions have been raised concerning Manhattan DA Cy Vance’s motivations for not prosecuting the case,
For MSNBC’s Mike Barnicle, it’s an “age old story about the issues of status, power, clout, and money in America that can separate you from consequences.”
“The New York police department had enough to go forward with a case on Harvey Weinstein: they had tape, they had motive, they had repetitive behavior,” he continued, “and somehow that got the shut down on the way to the Manhattan district attorney’s office.”
Morning Joe’s Joe Scarborough mentioned Vance’s handling of the Trump’s case, before stating “I can’t believe that in 2017 this is how justice is actually performed in Manhattan.”
“Is it really that easy, 2017, to write to a check to a DA? And you get charges dropped?” Scarborough asked. “I mean, this is out of the Simpsons, this is out of Mayor Quimby! This is a joke Mika!”
Later in the segment, Scarborough said that Vance’s face should be on the front page of the New York Times.

Pressed on whether or not the public should take Trump’s comments seriously, Sanders responded that the American people could take the president’s commitment to national security seriously.
A couple of minutes later, CNN political analyst April Ryan used the presidential remark to ask Sanders if this means the White House has “exhausted diplomacy.” The spokesperson referred to North Korea and how the administration was using economic and diplomatic pressure on the reclusive country, leading Ryan to ask if Trump’s comments were then referring to North Korea specifically.

0001081,"Fox News guest says that the only problem with missing 1,500 immigrant children is that America can't deport them","GRIFF JENKINS (CO-HOST): What is this about the government lost 1500 migrant children?
MARK KRIKORIAN (EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES): What it means is that when these unaccompanied minors -- this is people who came over, that were smuggled here by their parents but they came supposedly on their own, they were handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services, which takes care of this, and then they were placed with their illegal immigrant relatives in the United States at tax payer expense. What this number represents is that 30 days afterwards the social workers at Health and Human Services try to call up on the phone and say, you know, ""How are things going?"" And this number of people, 1400-something of them, they couldn't get in touch with. They didn't return the phone calls or they lied about what their phone numbers are, or they moved, something like that. And this is exactly the same thing that happened under Obama. We released a report on this a year and a half ago and there was nothing, no, crickets, because the problem here is not that some 4-year-old is wandering the streets in the middle of the night. Nothing like that is happening. The problem here is that the government has no idea where they are, therefore they're never going to show up for their hearings and they're here illegally, permanently. Under Obama that was a good thing, so it never got any news coverage. Now they're saying, ""Oh my God, Trump lost kids."" Now it's news.
JENKINS: It's interesting, Mark. So, is it your sense then that this has become political? It appears, if you look at Twitter and media outlets and really some stars, Alyssa Milano and some others tweeting that this is unbelievable, that this has now happened. Comparing it in some cases as if it were the terrible story of the Boko Haram girls, being kidnapped for the purposes of being terrorist's wives. Is this is same thing or is this just a politicization of the story?
KRIKORIAN: Yeah, this is a classic propaganda operation. I think it probably sort of happened by accident. Nobody planned it. But this is the way that propaganda works. You take a fact that's real, a kernel of truth, and then you twist it and manipulate it in such a way that's going to resonate with the target population you're trying to manipulate. This is, there's no question there are actually a handful of people probably, who were, of these young people, who were put in some kind of bad situation. That's entirely possible. But the bulk of this problem is that these illegal immigrants are on the run and the relatives that they were placed with don't want to talk with the government. That's why we can't get in touch with them.
JENKINS: Right, Mark, very quickly because we're almost out of time. For the practical viewers, are these kids missing?
KRIKORIAN: No, they are not missing. They are missing as far as the immigration system is concerned. And the point of that is they basically, we're never going to find them to return them to their own countries. That's the problem, it's not that they're on a milk carton somewhere.

0001082,Trump lays out immigration deal demands,"US President Donald Trump has said that there will be no deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation without funding to build a wall along the US-Mexico border
US President Donald Trump has said that there will be no deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation without funding to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, the media reported. ""The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed wall at the Southern Border and an end to the horrible Chain Migration and ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc,"" Trump tweeted on Friday.
""We must protect our Country at all cost!"" Trump's declaration casts doubt over how Democrats and Republicans will come together to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) participants, of which there are nearly 800,000 who were brought to the United States illegal as children, from deportation because it is unlikely that Democrats will agree to substantial funding for Trump's border wall in exchange for DACA protections, CNN reported.
Drew Hammill, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's spokesman, responded to Trump's tweet late Friday by stating that Democrats were ""not going to negotiate through the press and look forward to a serious negotiation at Wednesday's (January 3) meeting when we come back"". Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly will meet on January 3.
The top discussion topic will be renewed government spending talks. Trump's tweet is his clearest statement to date on his negotiating position with Democrats to achieve a deal on DACA, programmme launched by former President Barack Obama that Trump ended in September. Trump has demanded that funding for the border wall would need to be part of any deal, but it remains unclear how far he would be willing to go to protect DACA recipients. Earlier this year, the President had said that his administration was not looking at ""citizenship"" or ""amnesty"" but that they are ""looking at allowing people to stay here"".

0001083,If Democrats Win Big in November,"Pelosi and Schumer could cripple Trump’s deregulatory agenda, stymie Supreme Court picks, and focus on impeachment.
‘I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party — and please let Cryin’ Chuck stay!”
So tweeted a bullish President Trump last summer after Democrats lost a congressional special election in Georgia they had hoped to win. He got his wish: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are still in charge of their party on Capitol Hill. Now these two political veterans are leading the drive for a Democratic takeover of Congress this fall.
What if they succeed? What if they manage to switch out the “Minority” in their titles to “Majority”? What can America expect?
In a word: obstructionism — on an unprecedented scale.
A few months ago, conservatives were calling Pelosi and Schumer “do-nothing Democrats” for refusing to sit down with the president to negotiate a budget to keep the government open. That was just a warm-up act for the obstructionism to come if they get control of one or both houses of Congress.
Here are five things we can expect if the Dems win big in the midterm elections.
1) We will get no new conservative or constitutionalist judges.
Should a Supreme Court vacancy arise in the next two years, Democrats will make sure it has zero chance of being filled. They will see it as payback for the Senate Republican blockade of President Obama’s nominee to fill the vacancy left by Justice Scalia’s death.
But they won’t stop there. Democrats will also refuse to confirm any lower-court nominees they don’t care for — and that will be most of them. The Trump administration, working closely with Senate Republicans, has been remaking the federal courts, shifting away from judicial activism and toward an emphasis on the rule of law. If Democrats succeed this November, that process will grind to a halt.
2) No substantive legislation will be approved.
Despite being briefly courted by President Trump, Schumer and Pelosi have shown little interest in “doing deals” with him. If they get control of either House of Congress, they will probably put off major legislative priorities until 2021 — when they hope one of their own will occupy the White House. And if they make any exceptions to cutting deals with Trump, the bills they put on his desk will not be to the liking of conservatives.
3) House and Senate committees will be militantly focused on investigations and oversight.
If Democrats get their hands on the gavels of congressional committees, they will spend little time on productive legislating — why give President Trump any bipartisan accomplishments? Instead, they will devote their power and resources to methodically investigating the president, his staff, and his agency appointees.
Entrenched bureaucrats (some of them Obama appointees who burrowed into career positions) will effectively be put in control. The president’s own appointees in each agency will be undermined from within.
This will result in near-paralysis for the administration. Rather than working on the president’s agenda, the already-thin political leadership in the federal agencies will find itself under siege from Capitol Hill. Agency leaders will be constantly on defense, parrying committee document requests, subpoenas, and congressionally instigated inspector-general investigations. Executive-branch efforts to advance a right-of-center agenda will feel like trying to organize a softball league at Verdun.
4) Executive-branch confirmations will slow to a trickle.
Senate Democrats have already perfected the art of using every procedural trick in the book to slow the confirmation process and keep the federal government understaffed. If Democrats pick up a majority of Senate seats, expect them to double down on this strategy. If they allow an occasional nominee to get through, they will extract steep policy concessions and other tradeoffs in return.
The result? Entrenched bureaucrats (some of them Obama appointees who burrowed into career positions) will effectively be put in control. The president’s own appointees in each agency will be undermined from within as they try to implement his policies.
5) Democrats will use legislation to block Trump’s deregulatory agenda.
One of President Trump’s signature accomplishments has been a robust program of deregulation aimed at promoting economic growth. Most of that has been implemented by executive action, but Democrats would have the power to stymie the president’s deregulatory agenda if they seized control of one or both Houses of Congress.
Their most effective weapon would be riders to appropriations bills that would deny the funding needed to carry out new Trump-era rules — rules that most Democrats in Congress don’t like. President Trump could certainly veto such bills. However, he would eventually be forced into a government-shutdown scenario. Trump may judge that worth the risk, but Democrats could keep his deregulatory priorities in limbo for the duration.
If Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer get a fresh taste of power after the midterms, they won’t be thinking about the dangers of overreaching. But those dangers are real. Donald Trump pulled off an astonishing victory in 2016 because voters were tired of business as usual in Washington and wanted real change. The Democrats will be bullied by their far-left base to shut down President Trump’s audacious agenda and even attempt to impeach him. If they do, not only could their midterm gains be short-lived, but they may even help boost the reelection of a president they loathe.",unknown,True
0001084,We got a glimpse of Trump negotiating. It didn’t go well.,"White House officials made the unusual decision Tuesday to allow cameras to film a nearly hourlong immigration meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers. They probably wish they hadn’t.
For a moment, Democrats thought they had struck an unexpected deal with President Donald Trump. Trump had previously insisted that any deal protecting “dreamers” - undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children - should also include border security and/or a border wall. But he now says that he would support a “clean” bill protecting dreamers, and then take up comprehensive immigration reform later.
“What about a clean DACA bill now and a commitment to do comprehensive next?” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Trump responded: “Yeah, I would like to do that. I think a lot of people would like to see that.”
The problem? Trump didn’t know what “clean DACA bill” meant. Republicans quickly interjected and made clear that Trump believes a “clean” bill would include border security. Except that’s not at all what a clean bill is; that’s a compromise bill. A clean bill only has one component to it and doesn’t include multiple elements, which could muddy it.
By the end, Trump sought to clarify things. “I think a clean DACA bill, to me, is a DACA bill, but we take care of the 800,000 people,” he said. “But I think, to me, a clean bill is a bill of DACA - we take care of them, and we also take care of security.”
If anything, the whole mess showed pretty vividly just how utterly disengaged Trump is in the finer details of policy discussions. Which is exactly the perception that he has recently fought against.
Asked by The New York Times late last month about this perception, Trump bristled. “I know the details of taxes better than anybody - better than the greatest CPA,” he said. “I know the details of health care better than most, better than most.”

The problem is that every public indication gives us the opposite impression. Trump almost continually moves the goal posts on what he wants, shifts the terms of the debate and misstates what’s actually contained in the legislation that is before Congress.
Even by the end of the meeting, Trump seemed to indicate that the border wall isn’t necessarily a must-have for him - becoming just the latest iteration in a dizzying series of back-and-forths on what he wants in a DACA deal.
“My position will be what the people in this room come up with,” Trump said. He added later: “I’m not going to say, ‘Oh, gee, I want this,’ or ‘I want that.’ I will be signing it.”
OK, so you’re no longer demanding the border wall or even border security, then?
If you are a Democrat hearing those words, it’s pretty clear Trump isn’t wedded to his position on, well, anything. The border wall seems more like an opening bid. If Trump has shown us anything, it’s that he just wants to sign bills and make sure the base doesn’t hate him for it. So as long as he can plausibly say he fought the good fight for the border wall - even if he didn’t - it seems he’s ready to just get it over with and claim a legislative win.
Which is generally OK. Presidents needn’t dirty their hands with all of the sausage-making that happens on Pennsylvania Avenue. Congress produces the bills, and the president decides whether to sign them.
But Trump has repeatedly assured us that he knows this stuff better than almost anyone and that he’s the world’s pre-eminent negotiator. What we saw Tuesday was neither of those things.

0001088,Science Shows That Discriminating Against Religious Groups Feeds Radicalisation,"Marginalising and discriminating against immigrants displaced from their traditional countries and cultures is a significant contributor to feelings of radicalisation, according to a new study.
Two surveys involving approximately 400 Muslim immigrants living in the US and Germany show that prejudicial attitudes towards people trying to integrate into new cultures can end up making them more susceptible to extremist causes.
""We found that immigrants who identify with neither their heritage culture nor the culture they are living in feel marginalised and insignificant,""
""Experiences of discrimination make the situation worse.""
Lyons-Padilla's team conducted an online survey of 198 Muslim immigrants living in the US, asking them how connected they felt to their heritage and to American values – and how well they thought they had integrated into their new home.
In addition, the participants were given a hypothetical situation to consider, involving an imaginary fundamentalist group consisting of young Muslims, who existed to stand up against American maltreatment of Muslims.
While this made-up group was never explicitly said to condone or perpetuate violence, the participants were given the impression that the activists supported extreme actions where necessary.
The survey respondents were asked to what extent they could imagine their friends and social circle sympathising with the aims and values of this hypothetical group, and whether they'd be likely to conduct illegal or violent actions to help further its agenda.
The responses to the survey indicated that, overall, support for extremism was very low. This supported wider research that shows a majority of Muslims simply
However, within a small minority, the survey showed that a feeling of marginalisation and discrimination could predict feelings of insignificance – which in turn increased people's attraction to fundamentalist groups and their extreme behaviour.
According to Lyons-Padilla, the findings back up the
""Kruglanski [proposed] a particularly compelling theory: people become terrorists to restore a sense of significance in their lives, a feeling that they matter,"" Lyons-Padilla explained for
""Extremist organisations like Isis are experts at giving their recruits that sense of purpose, through status, recognition, and the promise of eternal rewards in the afterlife.""
To help counter the threat of extremist organisations, Lyons-Padilla argues that we need to diminish their appeal in the eyes of marginalised immigrants – and the first step in doing so is by not making them feel unwelcome and unappreciated in their adopted homelands.
In contrast, things like anti-Islam rhetoric, bans on Muslims travelling, and increased policing and monitoring of Muslim communities won't actually curb extremism – they'll just help enable it.
""According to my research, this is the recipe for making American Muslims feel disenfranchised and discriminated against,""
""We are actually planting the seeds for radicalisation and essentially helping Isis recruit by fuelling the narrative that the west is anti-Islam.""
In a separate, complementary survey that looked at the experience of 204 German Muslim immigrants – in addition to the US cohort – the researchers found that those living in the US were having an easier time integrating into US culture than their counterparts in Germany.
The team attributes this to the US having a comparatively

“We are now a year, two years into this, no Russian collusion. Case over,” he added.
Giuliani then added that the investigators broke numerous laws in their zeal to investigate President Trump, “In falling all over themselves to investigate him, they have committed numerous violations.”

0001099,How ISIS Got Its Flag,"On an August morning in 2014, someone noticed a black flag hanging outside a rundown duplex in suburban New Jersey. He could not make out its Arabic, but he recognized the design from horrific news reports about ISIS, in which masked jihadists fought under the banner to realize their dark vision of God’s rule on earth. Alarmed, the passerby sent a picture of the house and its flag to a friend, who promptly tweeted it and informed the Department of Homeland Security.
The flag’s owner, Mark Dunaway, had converted to Islam a decade prior, he explained to the police when they arrived, and he flew the flag to mark Muslim holidays. “Every Muslim uses that black flag,” he said. “You’ll find it in any mosque in the world.” Still, he took it down. “I understand now that people turn on CNN and see the flag associated with jihad, but that’s not the intention … at all. It says, ‘There is only one god, Allah, and the prophet Mohammed is his messenger.’ It’s not meant to be a symbol of hate.” Dunaway, like many Muslims and even Middle East experts, did not know that the flag had been designed by ISIS in 2006. He and others were confused because the Islamic State had used terror and Twitter to advertise its brand, and Islamic tradition to obscure its meaning.
Before the group declared itself the caliphate reborn that summer, it had been ambiguous about the flag’s meaning and the cause it represented. Was it the flag of an Islamic state, or the flag of the Islamic state—the caliphate that had once ruled land from Spain to Iran and whose prophesied return would herald the end of the world? The Islamic State encouraged the second interpretation but let the global community of jihadists read into the flag and the “state” what they would. The group’s cause proved so compelling among jihadists that in 2014 the organization supplanted its former master, al-Qaeda. The spread of the flag, then, traces the spread of an idea and chronicles a major changing of the guard in the global jihadist movement.
When the Islamic State first announced itself on October 15, 2006, it had no flag of its own. It was not until January 2007 that al-Qaeda’s media distribution arm, al-Fajr, released a picture of the Islamic State’s new flag. Anonymous authors affiliated with the Islamic State
Although the authors acknowledged other reports of green, white, and yellow flags, they concluded the Islamic State’s flag would be black, because most of the reports about Mohammed mentioned a black flag. The authors were equally confident when explaining the banner’s text. “What is written on the flag is what is written on the flag of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him.”
The Islamic State’s design of the Muslim profession of faith is different from every other attempt to replicate the prophet’s flag: “No god but God” is scrawled in white across the top and “Mohammed is the Messenger of God” is stacked in black inside a white circle. As the anonymous authors noted, they took the circle’s design from a seal of the prophet used on a set of letters, now housed in Turkey’s Topkapi Palace, that were supposedly written on Mohammed’s behalf. (Modern scholars doubt the letters’ authenticity.) We are meant to believe the Islamic State had inherited the prophet’s seal, just as the early caliphs had.
Why make a flag? In addition to following the prophet’s example, the Islamic State wanted a symbol to rally people to its cause. The group quoted a 19th-century Ottoman historian and official, Ahmad Cevdet Pasha, to make the point:
The secret in creating a flag is that it gathers people under a single banner to unify them, meaning that this flag is a sign of the coming together of their words and a proof of the unity of their hearts. They are like a single body and what knits them together is stronger than the bond of blood relatives.
Yet the Islamic State’s choices display the modern sensibilities they try so hard to displace. The white scrawl across the top, “No god but God,” is deliberately ragged, meant to suggest an era before the precision of Photoshop, even though the flag was designed on a computer. Even the Islamic State’s quotation of Ahmad Cevdet Pasha unwittingly betrays a modern perspective. Influenced by European notions of nationalism yet desiring to hold together the multiethnic Ottoman Empire under sovereign Turkish rule, Cevdet Pasha imagined Islam and its symbols to be the glue. “The only thing uniting Arab, Kurd, Albanian, and Bosnian is the unity of Islam,” he said, according to Dominic Lieven’s book Empire: The Russian Empire and its Rivals. “Yet the real strength of the Sublime State lies with the Turks.”
The Islamic State ended the explanation of its flag’s design with a prayer: “We ask God, praised be He, to make this flag the sole flag for all Muslims. We are certain that it will be the flag of the people of Iraq when they go to aid … the Mahdi at the holy house of God.” The house of God is the Kaaba in Mecca, the holiest shrine in Islam, and the Mahdi is the savior who Muslims believe will appear there in the years leading up to the apocalypse. The Islamic State was signaling that its flag was not only the symbol of its government and the herald of a future caliphate; it was the harbinger of the final battle at the End of Days.
Legends of the black flag and the Muslim savior, the Mahdi, first circulated during the reign of the Umayyad dynasty, which ruled the Islamic empire from Damascus in the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. The dynasty’s founders, the Umayya clan, had seized the caliphate from Mohammed’s son-in-law and grandsons, which infuriated many Muslims. People unhappy with Umayyad rule circulated prophecies of a man of the prophet’s family who would return justice to the world. They called the man the Mahdi, Arabic for “the Rightly Guided One.” Many of the prophecies envision the Mahdi appearing during the End of Days to lead the final battles against the infidels.
Like most Islamic prophecies of the End of Days, those about the Mahdi are not found in the preeminent scripture of Islam, the Koran, which Muslims believe preserves God’s revelation to Mohammed, but rather in the voluminous compendia of the words and deeds of the prophet and his companions, known as hadith, which were written down decades or even centuries after the prophet’s death. Muslims argue over the veracity of individual hadith, and the contradictions between them, the way some Christians debate the reliability of the Gospels and their discrepancies.
End-Time prophecies were an especially inviting target for fabricators. In the internecine wars that tore apart the early Muslim community, each side sought to justify its politics by predicting its inevitable victory and the other side’s preordained defeat. Prophecies proliferated, reaching into the thousands. When the politics evaporated, the prophetic residue remained.
Supporters of the prophet’s family loosely aligned themselves as part of what historians call the Hashemite movement, which believed the Mahdi would be a descendent of Mohammed’s great-grandfather, Hashem. Many of the movement’s supporters were from Iran, where Zoroastrian legends prophesied the coming of a club-wielding savior who would appear at the End of Time followed by sable-clad disciples. Influenced by the prophecies, the revolutionaries donned black clothes, flew black flags, and carried around wooden clubs called “infidel-bashers.”
As the revolutionaries built support for their cause, they circulated prophecies of soldiers fighting under black flags who would come from the East to overthrow the Umayyads. Some were put in the mouth of Mohammed’s son-in-law, Ali, who allegedly foretold the coming of an army from Khorasan, the “land of the rising sun” that includes parts of eastern Iran and most of Afghanistan. Other black-flag prophecies were attributed to the prophet himself. “If you see the black banners coming from Khorasan,” instructs one, “go to them immediately even if you must crawl over ice because indeed among them is the caliph, al-Mahdi.”
In early Islam, the color black was associated not just with mourning but also with revenge for a wrongful death. According to the historian Ibn Khaldun, the opponents of the Umayyads adopted black as their color to avenge the Umayyads’ persecution of the prophet’s family. Black flags were also flown by the prophet in his war with the infidels. “Do not flee with [the flag] from the infidels and do not fight with it against the Muslims,” Mohammed reportedly told one of his generals.
Apocalyptic messages resonate among many Muslims today because of the political turmoil in the Middle East. In 2012,

0001100,Donald Trump Goes Full Fredo,"“I can handle things. I’m smart! Not like everybody says, like dumb. I’m smart and I want respect!”
This morning’s presidential Twitter outburst recalls those words of Fredo Corleone’s in
Trump may imagine that he’s Michael Corleone, the tough and canny rightful heir—or even Sonny Corleone, the terrifyingly violent but at least powerful heir apparent—but after today he is Fredo forever.
There’s a key difference between film and reality, though: The Corleone family had the awareness and vigilance to exclude Fredo from power. The American political system did not do so well.
Michael Wolff’s scathing new book about the Trump White House has sent President Trump spiraling into the most publicly visible meltdown of his presidency. Until now, Trump’s worst moments have occurred behind closed doors, and have become known to the public only second-hand, leaked by worried officials, aides, and advisers. Yesterday and today, we have seen a Trump temper tantrum in real time on Twitter, extended over hours, punctuated only by stretch of fitful presidential sleep. Trump’s
It may not be the newsiest—arguably it is the least newsy—but the most important moment in Wolff’s book are words attributed at second or third-hand to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the time of Donald Trump’s election. “He will sign anything we put in front of him.”
Who and what Donald Trump is has been known to everyone and anyone who cared to know for years and decades. Before he was president, he was the country’s leading racist conspiracy theorist. Before he was the country’s leading racist conspiracy theorist, he was a celebrity gameshow host. Before he was a celebrity gameshow host, he was the multi-bankrupt least trusted name in real estate. Before he was the multi-bankrupt least trusted name in real estate, he was the protege of Roy Cohn’s repeatedly accused of ties to organized crime. From the start, Donald Trump was a man of many secrets, but no mysteries. Inscribed indelibly on the public record were the reasons for responsible people to do everything in their power to bar him from the presidency.
Instead, since he announced his candidacy in mid-2015, Donald Trump has been enabled and protected.
The enabling and protecting not only continues. It accelerates.
Before the Saturday morning tweets, what should have been the biggest story of the week was Trump’s success at mobilizing the Senate and the FBI to deploy criminal prosecution as a weapon against Trump critics. The Senate Judiciary committee—the Senate Judiciary Committee! The committee that oversees the proper enforcement of the law!—formally filed a criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous dossier about Trump’s Russia connections. The referral was signed by the committee’s chairman, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, without even notice to Democrats on the committee,
The Department of Justice can ignore such a referral. It’s ominous, however, that on the very same day, the FBI obeyed Trump’s repeated demands and reopened a long-closed criminal investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The FBI has come under relentless abuse from Trump, who complains about its refusal to do his will. Is it now yielding?
We also learned this week from The New York Times that aides to the attorney general
Michael Wolff has drawn the most indelible picture yet of Donald Trump, the man. But the important thing about Trump is not the man; it’s the system of power surrounding the man.
In 2016, there were voters who genuinely, in good faith, believed that Donald Trump was a capable business leader, moderate on social issues, who cared about the troubles of working class white America—and would do something to help. There may well still be some people who believe this—but nowhere near enough to sustain a presidency.
What sustains Trump now is the support of people who know what he is, but back him anyway. Republican political elites who know him for what he is, but who back him because they believe they can control and use him; conservative-media elites who sense what he is, but who delight in the culture wars he provokes; rank-and-file conservatives who care more about their grievances and hatreds than the governance of the country.
After the Trump pardon of Sheriff Arpaio for obstruction of justice, a popular conservative blogger
However crazy Trump may be, in one way he is indeed the “very stable genius” he claims to be: Trump understands how to mobilize hatred and resentment to his own advantage and profit. He has risen higher than Joe McCarthy or Charles Lindbergh or Theodore Bilbo—and he has lasted already nearly a full year in office, holding the approval of one-third of the country, more than sufficient to keep him there for a full term.
Michael Wolff has done a crucial service, showing more intimately than any reporter yet the true nature of the man at the center of the American system. But without the complicity of other power-holders, Trump would drop from his central position like a tooth from a rotten gum. What we need to do now is widen the camera angle beyond Fredo Trump to the hard-faced men and women over his shoulders. Those are the people who put Trump where he is, and keep him there, corrupting the institutions of American democracy and troubling the peace and security of the world.

However, in this moment in time, I would give anything to not belong to that group - just for the sake of the reputation that they’re foolishly giving themselves - and the people that call themselves conservatives but don’t act out like this.
If this party didn’t already lose enough respect, they certainly lost it all now. In most of the world, the republican party has already been anything but respected. But now, it’s like they dug a hole for themselves and, as conservatives, are shoveling the dirt right on top of them.
Thanks to this hideous outrage coming from white supremacists, the conservative name is being dragged through the mud. Because of that, it will take a very long time to gain the respect of the people identifying with that party - even if they’re nothing like the people torching, chanting, and hating. And, because of that, people like me (and other people who belong to this party) are included in the thought that we must think that hatred, too.
It's sad to realize that prejudice is still alive and well. In fact, it's more active now than it has been in a long time. Unfortunately, for some people, it took a dangerous and destructive for some people to recognize that.

Fairbanks then points out that the media thrives on leaked information, which is often false, and sometimes results in ""disastrous consequences, sometimes even deadly - like the case in the Iraq War,"" adding ""unlike the fake news published by outlets like the NYT to sell war to the public, Assange has published true, real information that has influenced the public to want to get out of wars.""
She then notes that Assange was ""once held in the absolute highest regard by the left for the publishing of the Iraq and Afghan war logs,"" crippling the agenda of the ""war-hungry swamp"" and dealing a massive blow to the Bush administration.
We elected Trump because of his rejection of the war-monger establishment, and the fake news media.

0001105,Caravan of asylum seekers ask to be let into US,"TIJUANA, Mexico — U.S. border inspectors allowed some of the Central American asylum seekers to enter the country for processing, ending a brief impasse over lack of space. Now, the migrants who crossed Mexico in a caravan may face a long legal path.
Some of the nearly 100 migrants from Central America and Mexico have been allowed to enter the U.S. as they seek asylum, but the road for them is far from over.
Men, women and children of all ages are part of this caravan that has been moving from Honduras, into El Salvador, and then Mexico.
Over the weekend, they reached the U.S. border and many are currently being blocked from entering the states.
They have arrived in Tijuana, the famous Mexican city that borders southern California, just outside of San Diego.
Border patrol agents in San Diego have let a handful of people through to process them, where they will then be held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Vice President Mike Pence spoke in front of border patrol and pledged to build the wall.
""This situation is a direct result of our weak immigration laws and our porous border. This caravan, like those who have gone before, is also rightly understood as a deliberate attempt to undermine the laws of this country and the sovereignty of the United States,"" said Pence.
While the roughly 100 migrants at the border say they need to be let in now before it is too late for them.
A grandmother of two, Isabel Rodriguez, says she is fleeing El Salvador because of the growing gang violence and wants to be given asylum in the U.S.
""Mr. Trump, just like you allowed our fellow brothers and sisters from Central America to live in the country, allow us the opportunity. We want to work, we don't want handouts. We want a better future for our family,"" pleaded Rodriguez.
American attorneys who volunteered advice in Tijuana last week warned the Central Americans that parents may be separated from their children and be detained for many months while their asylum cases are pending.
Asylum-seekers are typically held up to three days at the border and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer’s initial screening, they may be detained or released with ankle monitors while their cases wind through immigration court, which can take years.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, but few are likely to win asylum.
The denial rate for El Salvadorans seeking asylum was 79 percent from 2012 to 2017, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Action Clearinghouse. Hondurans were close behind with a 78 percent denial rate, followed Guatemalans at 75 percent.
Trump administration officials have railed against what they call ""legal loopholes"" and ""catch-and-release” policies that allow people seeking asylum to be freed while their cases are adjudicated. The president tweeted Monday that the caravan ""shows how weak &amp; ineffective U.S. immigration laws are.""
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has pledged to send more immigration judges to the border if needed and threatened criminal prosecution. On Monday, the Justice Department said it filed illegal entry charges against 11 people identified as caravan members.

The answer, unfortunately, is that voters who support stronger gun control neglect to hold lawmakers accountable for kowtowing to the NRA. That may well change, with the youth leading the way after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting this year, laying bare the cowardice of lawmakers and pressing the need for basic gun control measures. In this year’s elections across the nation, voters have the opportunity to set things straight by electing lawmakers who will stand up to the NRA and enact sensible gun laws.
It turns out Baltimore County voters will have this choice. Democratic State Sen. Jim Brochin, who is running for Baltimore County Executive, has repeatedly stood up to the NRA and backed sensible gun laws. Meanwhile his opponent in the Democratic primary, Johnny Olszewski Jr. — who has earned the backing of the Baltimore County Progressive Democrats Club — has repeatedly done the NRA’s bidding.

0001109,"Black-clad anarchists storm Berkeley rally, assaulting 5","BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Black-clad anarchists on Sunday stormed into what had been a largely peaceful Berkeley protest against hate and attacked at least five people, including the leader of a politically conservative group who canceled an event a day earlier in San Francisco amid fears of violence.
The group of more than 100 hooded protesters, with shields emblazoned with the words “no hate” and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchists, busted through police lines, avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons. Then the anarchists blended with a crowd of 2,000 largely peaceful protesters who turned up to demonstrate in a “Rally Against Hate” opposed to a much smaller gathering of right-wing protesters.
Berkeley police chief Andrew Greenwood defended how police handled the protest, saying they made a strategic decision to let the anarchists enter to avoid more violence.
Greenwood said “the potential use of force became very problematic” given the thousands of peaceful protesters in the park. Once anarchists arrived, it was clear there would not be dueling protests between left and right so he ordered his officers out of the park and allowed the anarchists to march in.
There was “no need for a confrontation over a grass patch,” Greenwood said.
Among those assaulted was Joey Gibson, the leader of the Patriot Prayer group, which canceled a Saturday rally and was then prevented from holding a news conference when authorities closed off the public square Gibson planned to use. Gibson has denounced racism and said he launched Patriot Prayer after several supporters of President Donald Trump were beaten at a Trump campaign stop in San Jose, California, last year. Authorities nonetheless feared the group’s event could attract white nationalists, as it has in the past.
After the anarchists spotted Gibson at the Berkeley park, they pepper-sprayed him and chased him out as he backed away with his hands held in the air. Gibson rushed behind a line of police wearing riot gear, who set off a smoke bomb to drive away the anarchists.
Separately, groups of hooded, black-clad protesters attacked at least four other men in or near the park, kicking and punching them until the assaults were stopped by police. The assaults were witnessed by an Associated Press reporter.
Police in the San Francisco area have been braced for violence and trying to prevent protests that draw left-wing and right-wing opponents since the deadly confrontation in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 that occurred during a rally of white supremacists.
Berkeley authorities did not issue a permit for Sunday’s gathering of right-wing protesters. Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin had urged counterprotesters to stay away from Civic Center Park.
The right-wing event had been canceled by organizer Amber Cummings, who encouraged supporters to stay away but said she would attend on her own.
By mid-afternoon Cummings had not appeared and left-wing protesters far outnumbered right-wing supporters.
Earlier in the day, police had set up barricades around park and checked people who entered to make sure they did not have prohibited items like baseball bats, dogs, skateboards and scarves or bandanas they could use to cover their faces.
Officers arrested 13 people, most for having prohibited items, Greenwood said.
At one point, an anti-rally protester denounced a Latino man holding a “God Bless Donald Trump” sign.
“You are an immigrant,” Karla Fonseca said. “You should be ashamed of yourself.”
Several other people also yelled at the man, who said he was born in Mexico but supports Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the southern border.
Police pulled one supporter of President Donald Trump out of the park over a wall by his shirt as a crowd of about two dozen counter-demonstrators surrounded him and chanted “Nazi go home” and pushed him toward the edge of the park. At least two people were detained by officers for wearing bandannas covering their faces.
Anti-rally protesters chanted slogans “No Trump. No KKK. No fascist USA” and carried signs that said: “Berkeley Stands United Against Hate.”
A separate group of counterprotesters had assembled earlier Sunday at the nearby University of California, Berkeley campus and then marched park to merge with the anti-rally protesters who had already gathered there.
Both Cummings and Gibson have disavowed racism and say they wanted to hold the rallies to bring conservative voices to the liberal San Francisco Bay Area.
Student activism was born during the 1960s free-speech movement at Berkeley, when thousands of students at the university mobilized to demand that the school drop its ban on political activism.
However, the violence in Charlottesville led San Francisco area police and civil leaders to rethink their response to protests.

0001115,No Amnesty Is a Good Amnesty,"Donald Trump is being told that amnesty for “Dreamers,” or DACA recipients, will only apply to a small, narrowly defined group of totally innocent, eminently deserving illegal immigrants, who were brought to this country “through no fault of their own” as “children.” (Children who are up to 36 years old.)
Every syllable of that claim is a lie, and I can prove it.
To see how DACA will actually work, let’s look at another extremely limited amnesty that was passed in 1986.
Farmers wanted temporary guest-worker permits for their cheap labor, so that they could continue pretending that the Industrial Revolution never happened and refuse to mechanize. (And, boy, did that work! We haven’t heard a peep about “crops rotting in the fields” since then.)
The agricultural amnesty was supposed to apply to — at most — 350,000 illegal aliens. It would be available only to illegals who were currently in the country doing the back-breaking farm work that no American would do. Without them, crops would wither on the vine. They were saving us from starvation!
Talk about deserving. Are any Dreamers saving us from starvation?
But instead of guest-worker permits, then-Rep. Charles Schumer — from the lush farmland of Brooklyn — decided to grant full amnesty to any illegals who had done farm work for at least 90 days in the previous year.
That’s pretty restrictive, isn’t it?
In the end, “up to 350,000 farm workers” turned into 1.3 million.
Oh well, what are you going to do? No use worrying — let’s just move forward and get all these people voter registration cards!
This innocent little amnesty for a small, clearly defined group of illegals quickly became amnesty for anyone who applied. The same thing will happen with any other amnesty, no matter how strictly the law is written. (And it won’t be written strictly.)
In the first few years of the agricultural amnesty, internal Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics showed that 888,637 legalization applications were fraudulent. According to immigration agents, “farm workers” stated in their interviews that cotton was purple or that they had pulled cherries from the ground.
Of the 888,637 fraudulent applications, guess how many our government approved. Answer: More than 800,000.
The agricultural amnesty was so carefully administered that not one, but TWO of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers were in this country because of it. (More on that in another column.)
The main problem with the farm worker amnesty, the DACA amnesty or any amnesty is that everyone involved in the entire immigration apparatus is feverishly working, on the taxpayer’s dime, to transform this country into a Third World hellhole. Lawyers for La Raza and lawyers for the government both believe it is their mission to humiliate and destroy white Christian America. (Actually, this country is “biracial Christian America,” plus a few Amerindians and anyone else who assimilated to Western European culture.)
There are multitudes of them, and they will never, ever stop.
Congress could pass a law granting amnesty to any 7-foot-tall, left-handed, red-headed illegal aliens from Lichtenstein — and hundreds of left-wing outfits would instantly set to work, demanding amnesty for witch doctors, cannibals, pederasts, terrorists and the rest of the multicultural universe that makes America so vibrant.
On the other side of the application process would be government immigration bureaucrats who either used to work at La Raza, or hope to in the future.
On the off chance that some particularly risible amnesty application is denied by a stodgy rules-follower in our immigration bureaucracy, that denial will be litigated before a federal judge in Hawaii, then appealed to the Ninth Circuit.
For two decades after the 1986 amnesty, the federal courts were tied up with dozens of class-action lawsuits brought on behalf of illegal aliens — regular illegal aliens, farm worker illegal aliens and still-in-Mexico illegal aliens — challenging every aspect of the law.
Is that how American tax dollars should be spent? On endless litigation, brought by America-hating activists on behalf of people who have no right to be in our country and decided by Democrat-appointed judges? (Who are also America-hating activists.)
And when their work is done, there will be a lot more Democrat-appointed judges because there will be a lot more Democrats.
Lawyers sued over everything — the absence of Creole interpreters, the requirement that illegals have proof of prior farm work and the rare denials of amnesty. Congress desperately tried passing laws that would prevent courts from hearing these cases — all to no avail. Left-wing lawyers just had to pick the right judge, and they won.
In 2005 — nearly 20 years after the 1986 amnesty — the Ninth Circuit was still granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who claimed they had been unfairly denied because they were not in the country for the first amnesty. Seriously.
No matter how the law is written, as long as anyone is eligible for amnesty, everybody’s getting amnesty.
President Trump is the last president who will ever have a chance to make the right decision on immigration. After this, it’s over. The boat will have sailed.
If he succeeds, all the p@ssy-grabbing and Russia nonsense will burn off like a morning fog. He will be the president who saved the American nation, its character, its sovereignty, its core identity. But if he fails, Donald Trump will go down in history as the man who killed America.",unknown,True

0001117,Ironman World Champion Competitors’ Country Devastated by Hurricane Irma,"Triathlete Cayley Mackay and her girlfriend Nicole Erato were in the middle of the Ironman 70.3 World Championships when they learned that their entire country, the island of Saint Maarten/Saint Martin, was destroyed by the eye of Category 5+ Hurricane Irma. Cayley shared her experience with us and different ways in which we can help.
This is a modal window.
AfterEllen: Where is your home located and what category level was Hurricane Irma when it hit your house?
Cayley Mackay: My home is located on the beautiful Caribbean island of Sint Maarten. Hurricane Irma was a level 5+ as they were experiencing winds and conditions much worse than a typical Category 5. It was largest hurricane in history in the Atlantic and according to the New York Times “has broken records for accumulated cyclone energy, a measure that combines storm strength and duration”. The eye hit Sint Maarten and was so large that satellite imagery shower the entire island in the eye of Irma.
Cayley Mackay: There is no power. No water. No hospital. No airport. No nothing. My girlfriend Nicole and I were away representing Sint Maarten at the Ironman 70.3 World Championships when the hurricane hit. We did not hear from our family for over 48 hours. We are not able to return to the island yet as there are no flights, at this point it is only evacuation flights allowed to enter and that is recent.
AfterEllen: How many others are going through this on your Island?
Cayley Mackay: The island is 37.2 square miles and is divided between Dutch (Sint Maarten) and French (Saint Martin). The population of the entire island is around 100,000 people and every single person has been affected. Most of our friends and family have lost their homes, lost their businesses, lost everything. If you still have a roof over your head (literally because thousands of roofs were ripped off) you are considered to be very lucky right now. There are dozens of deaths and we still have friends who are unaccounted for.
Cayley Mackay: Nicole and I are doing everything in our power to get the word out that SXM needs international aid. We have been fundraising for the island (
Those at home have been trying to survive. People have been running out of water and food. Saturday, Sept. 9, they were under hurricane warning from Hurricane Jose so people were trying to find safe places to stay that had not already been destroyed by Irma. It is definitely survival mode. But the people of Sint Maarten/Saint Martin are resilient. They are helping each other in as many ways as possible, sharing food and water and providing shelter when they can. Of course there are also those who are taking advantage of the situation and there has been wide spread looting and crime however most are doing their best to help. The spirit I have seen from home is unmatched.
Cayley Mackay: The biggest thing right now is to spread the word. Irma has destroyed so many. Most recently it has affected Florida and most of the big news stations are turning away from showing the damage and destruction on the islands to show Florida. Please don’t forget about us! We are an isolated island and will not be able to rebuild on our own. We need the world to know how much help we need so the first thing people can do is help us to spread the word. The second thing is to donate. Money donations can be sent to
Cayley Mackay: The world lost contact with Sint Maarten around 6:30am on Wednesday September 6th when the eye hit. The last thing we heard was Nicole’s mom screaming at her dad to get back because he was trying to hold the doors shut and her grandmother crying and screaming that the roof was coming off. Her uncles roof has already come off. We then waited over 48 hours in a numb state waiting to hear if they had survived. Our story is normal. The destruction is unimaginable. Lives have been changed forever. We need help. The island needs help. Please don’t forget about us.",unknown,False

Mayor Buttigieg disagrees.
This piece completely misses what it means to be a mayor. The president is nothing like a mayor, and that's too bad.
Trump is nothing like an American mayor, not a modern one anyway. Certainly not a good one.
He has nothing resembling a ""mayoral core."" If he did, he'd be more concerned with solving problems. A mayor knows it's not all about him.
A mayor worries less about credit and blame, more about results. A mayor picks up the trash, plows the snow, fills holes in the road.
A mayor cannot possibly traffic in alternative facts, because the facts are everywhere.
A mayor cannot dismiss or ignore the press, because the press is made of people who live in the same community.
A mayor doesn't insult women. For one thing, he or she will run into their spouses or parents somewhere in town.
Contrary to the article, the Carrier stunt would never fly for a mayor, because people live here and would hold you accountable.
A mayor knows her highest responsibility is to unite her constituents, and does not pit them against each other.
A mayor assumes responsibility for what's happening in the city, good and bad. A mayor cannot afford to specialize in allocating blame.

According to Rose McGowan, Affleck was fully aware of Weinstein's behavior and even ""told him to stop doing that.""
“You lie,” she wrote on Twitter after Affleck released his statement stating that he was supposedly “angry” and sickened by the news about Weinstein. Affleck told McGowan to her face that he was aware that Weinstein harassed women and that he advised him to cut it out. Then he made it seem as if he was totally shocked by the reports.
McGowan had a few short words for the deceptive actor:
Ben Affleck fuck off
But it seems that Affleck won’t actually be leaving the news cycle for some time, as a TRL fan came forward to remind everyone that the actor who was so shocked and saddened that Harvey Weinstein could harass women is a harasser himself.
Actress Hilarie Burton was the host of Total Request Live in 2003 when she was just 21 years old.
On Tuesday night, October 10, after Ben Affleck released his statement and after Rose McGowan called him out, Burton replied to a tweet reminding everyone that she was actually harassed by Ben Affleck on TRL back in the day.
You can watch it here:
This wasn’t that long ago. It happened on air. They commented on it. Burton had to laugh and move on at the time because she was on the job.
Men, even supposedly upstanding ones who ""condemn"" sexual harassment, often feel entitled to women's bodies and believe that there's nothing wrong with that. That's sickening.
The harassment of women has become so normalized that men like Ben Affleck don’t even think they’ve done something wrong when they grope a woman’s breast without her consent.

The Antifa, the ‘anti-fascist’ malevolent anarchists and protesters are anything but anti-fascist. The masked, ant-like, skinny jeaned, Taliban bearded violent arm of the Democratic Party would have found a home in Hitler’s Germany, Stalin’s Soviet Union, Honecker’s East Germany and Pol Pot’s Cambodia.
The Antifa are funded by George Soros and have several goals: to destroy property, to attack conservatives or anyone deemed an enemy of the left, to serve as modern day SA Brownshirts in the left’s destruction of every single American institution, American value and tenet of American civilization.
The Antifa are in existence to establish a beachhead, where the forces of liberalism and globalism not only land, but move inland to complete the takedown of America by the left and the global elite.
The Antifa are simply the enemy of the America way of life and any American who believes in freedom and the Bill of Rights.
In the name of diversity, the Antifa preaches violence and the end to free speech.
In the name of tolerance, the Antifa burns down buildings, sets cars on fire and assaults innocent people.
In the name of peace and harmony, the Antifa seeks to eradicate every statue, flag and monument of Americans they deem to be their enemy.

0001128,Lil Wayne's 'Nightline' Fail Shows Why Asking Celebrities For More Than What They Sell Leads To Disappointment,"Who is
On Wednesday (Nov. 2), Lil Wayne (real name Dwyane Carter) landed in hot water after ABC News' Nightline aired an interview with the rapper. Attached to promotion of his Gone Till November book, a jail memoir about his months spent in New York’s Rikers Island on gun possession charges, the interview took a turn when reporter Linsey Davis asked him about his, at times, misogynistic lyrics: ""Would you have a problem with [your daughter] being called a b-tch or a ho?""
Already causing a stir with his controversial September interview with
""I am a young Black rich motherf--ker,"" Wayne began. “If that doesn’t let you know that America understands Black n---as matter these days, I don’t know what it is. Don’t come at me with that dumb shit, ma’am. My life matters, especially to my b-tches. I don't feel connected to a damn thing that ain't got nothin' to do with me. If you do, you're crazy as shit.” He proceeded to tell Davis what he is connected to by whipping out a red bandana from his back pocket, seemingly to show his affiliation to the Bloods, a Los Angeles gang with branches all over the country. Interview over.
First, let’s address the massive levels of isolation and ignorance it takes to not know what “Black Lives Matter” is about in 2016. It’s beyond difficult to believe that an artist who’s as connected to the outside world as Lil Wayne doesn't know what’s going on in it. By virtue of being a massive sports fan alone, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s stance against the National Anthem is an unavoidable entry point to the issues of Black America for Wayne.
Aside from his alleged Bloods affiliation, Wayne’s connected to something that hits closer to home: his family. In the aforementioned Undisputed interview, Wayne thoughtfully explained that his children are his only true concern. “My politics, my flag, my country, my nation, my world are [my children] Reginae, Cameron, Neal and his brother [Dwayne]. That’s all that matters."" Fair enough. But there is an obvious connection to be made with a 34-year-old Black father raising three Black sons and one Black daughter, and wanting them (and the world they grow up in) to be safe from potentially racist, gun-happy cops. Yes, fame can, and often does, gift those with it a freedom from traditional prejudices but it’s hard to accept that Wayne’s that far gone. Certainly not when he has songs in his catalog that speak directly to social injustice and racism.
Months removed from 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, which annihilated Wayne’s native New Orleans, the rapper released what arguably is his most politically heated song to date ""Georgia… Bush."" It’s a cut that attacks then President George Bush, the U.S. government for their negligence in dispersing FEMA aid to the mostly African American refugees in Louisiana, and the media reporting on it. ""Boy them cops is killas in my home,"" he spits on the ’06 track. ""N---a shot dead in the middle of the street/I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat/Man, f--k the police and President (Georgia) Bush.”
Just this year, Wayne was a featured guest on
""Then I walk up in the bank, pants sagging down,” he raps. ""And I laugh at frowns, what they mad about? 'Cause here come this motherfucker with this mass account that didn't wear cap and gown/Are you mad 'cause the judge ain't give me more time?"" As far as imagery goes it’s not a stretch to assume that at least some of those with prejudices against him -- a young Black man -- are white people in that scenario. Lil Wayne knows what racism is -- and it’s evident he’s aware of it in 2016. So why not speak about it?
As Wayne ripped the Nightline microphone pack from his chest and strolled off, he’s heard saying, ""I ain’t no f--king politician."" That is true -- Lil Wayne is Lil Wayne and that’s not what he’s known for selling.
There lies the plight faced by anyone hoping for Wayne, or anyone else of his stature, to be someone they are not. The risk of being disappointed is huge because simply put, artists, athletes and entertainers overall don’t owe the world anything outside of what they became famous for.
Here's Lil Wayne, a man who clearly doesn’t want to speak about political issues, being asked to be as outspoken as some of his peers like Jay Z, Kendrick Lamar, T.I. and Common, who have spoken on BLM-related issues this year within their music, performances and social media.
In an age where Black people feel like lesser beings (for obvious reasons, including umpteen senseless killings and the hands of policemen), it would help to have a figure as big as Lil Wayne join the fray as an outspoken representative. How impactful would it be to see all those Caucasian faces at a Lil Wayne show yelling “Black Lives Matter” or rallying behind the cause in a significant way? Very.
It hurts the cause and the culture to see Wayne throw up a Blood flag before tossing his snapback cap into the BLM ring. Later on Wednesday, Wayne issued an apology of sorts for his ill-conceived remarks, which also followed him being questioned about his misogyny.
""When the reporter began asking me questions about my daughter being labeled a bitch and a hoe, I got agitated,” Wayne told
Still, what’s done is done. Many fans, followers, media outlets and social media users have already shown their disapproval of Wayne’s negligence. He was even dubbed ""Donkey of the Day"" by Power 105. 1 radio jock Charlemagne The God just hours after the interview segment was released. According to

0001136,"At This Point, I Don’t Care Why You Still Support This President","I care deeply about people.
My efficacy and usefulness as a pastor and caregiver (and as a decent member of humanity), is predicated on knowing how people’s hearts work, the way they think, how they respond to fear, what motivates and hurts them. Understanding human beings is my life’s work. It is the work of every one of us striving for empathy regardless of profession or placement.
There are times though, when people’s actions are so profoundly damaging to others, that asking why isn’t the most pressing question; moments when to belabor that question would be irresponsible to those at risk. When you come upon someone in the street inflicting violence on another human being, your first priority is to provide care for the injured, to protect others by moving them out of harm’s way, and to stop the violent act in progress. Only then is seeking to understand the motivations of the aggressor helpful. Only then do you ask, “Why would someone do this?” In the middle of the fray, when people are in danger—there isn’t time.
People are in danger, in these moments.
Right now I’m not interested in knowing why those who still support this President do so, not because they don’t matter or I don’t see their worth or because their stories are of no interest to me—but simply because other people’s lives and families and personal safety are in the balance—and those people merit my attention and urgency. The Jesus of my faith tradition was a shepherd. Yes he cared for the sheep, but he had to pushback hard against the wolves of the world to do it.
Talking to embittered people right now and trying to understand their motivations may help explain the rationale for their destructive choices, but it does nothing to protect those affected by their choices, those who don’t have the luxury of waiting around for an answer, those who don’t have the privilege of time.
And so in these moments, rather than trying to understand why someone would possibly advocate to take away a sick person’s healthcare—I am going to fight on behalf of the sick person and demand that all people be cared for under the laws of this land.
Rather than asking why someone would want to take away an LGBTQ person’s right to marry or why they’d want to make them feel unwelcome in their church or to feel threatened in a bathroom—I’m going to loudly affirm their right to love and worship and urinate as they desire.
Instead of trying crack the complex code that drives someone to persecute peaceful Muslims simply for pursuing their chosen faith tradition—I’m going to stand with Muslims and declare their inherent worth and the beauty of their spirituality.
Rather than trying to help you process why saying “Black lives matter” is such a hardship to you and the implications of your refusal—I’m going to go ahead and tell you that they matter to me.
And so it isn’t that I don’t respect those doing these things, or that their hearts and their fears and their motivations and hurts don’t matter—believe me they do. It’s just that right now, there are more urgent needs: rescuing imperiled people from the fruit of their bad decisions and the fallout of their malicious choices.
In these moments, I’m not really interested in whatever toxic cocktail of bad theology, fear, life experience, nationalism, and personality that have created their responses—as I am helping people who are made vulnerable by their responses. I’d like to uncover and care for the heart of the bully, but in this hour I need to defend the bodies and souls of the bullied.
So with all due respect, if you’re still supporting this hateful, reckless, malignant President, and still applauding and blessing the actions that cause incredible harm to millions of Americans—I’m not particularly interested in figuring out why you’re doing that today. One day I will, but right now I’d rather make sure people don’t die because they get cancer, or commit suicide because they feel unloved, or are forced from a country they love and deserve to live in.
Yes, if you support this President and the sickness he’s spreading I’d really like to one day understand you, but on behalf of those so endangered because of them—first I want to stop the bleeding.",unknown,True

0001138,Wall Street Journal Reporter Asks Russia For “Clinton Information” ----Turns Up DEAD 2 Days Later,"A Wall Street Journal Editor who was investigating how a Russian Pharmaceutical firm could have been purchased in 2014 by an American Pharmaceutical firm while Sanctions against Russia existed against such business transactions, has been found dead in his New York City apartment. The crux of the dead journalists investigation was how then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton influenced the transaction to be finalized, but only AFTER her husband Bill was paid $500,000 for giving a speech in Moscow.
The Russia Consulate General’s office in New York City was contacted by Wall Street Journal reporter/editor Joseph Rago who requested a Thursday (20 July) in person interview with consular officials regarding an upcoming article he was preparing on Hillary Clinton and her links to Russia. Rago failed to attend the meeting and was later discovered dead in his apartment of as yet “unknown causes” just hours prior to this meeting occurring.
Joseph Rago was a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter whose expertise was in the health care field. His stated purpose for this meeting was his investigating Hillary Clinton’s links to the 2014 sale of Veropharm (one of Russia’s largest medical companies) to the American medical giant Abbott Laboratories.
Critical to note about Abbott Laboratories acquiring Veropharm, is that the deal was FINALIZED on December 12, 2014; 9 months AFTER Sanctions were imposed upon Russia. It may interest some to know that Russian sanctions could be ""Waived"" . . . . by the State Department, for instance!
This takeover of Veropharm was structured to evade the Obama regime sanctions against Russia, and was accomplished by a US shell company named Kew Garden Hills, LLC -- registered in Delaware –and-- Hillary Clinton’s home State of New York -- acquiring approximately 98% of Veropharm shares—and then that shell company, Kew Garden Hills, LLC, being bought by Abbott Laboratories.
Interestingly, Kew Garden Hills, LLC, has no officer, directors, or even corporate information listed in the S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence database; a strange fact for a firm involved in a multi-billion dollar US/foreign pharmaceutical acquisition. Here, check the
Handling this transaction, was the Russian investment bank Renaissance Capital — who are noted for their having paid former President Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech he gave before their top executives in Moscow.
Rago told Russian consular officials that he had documents linking Hillary Clinton to both Abbott Laboratories and Kew Garden Hills, so it was believed by them that this was the line of inquiry he was going to pursue during his requested meeting — which never took place because Rago turned up dead.
The mysterious death of the 34-year-old Joseph Rago, follows by less than 2 weeks the ""suicide"" of another Hillary Clinton linked person named Renwick Haddow—a top former Haitian government official who ended up with a bullet in his head just a week prior to his testifying against Hillary Clinton in a Miami, Florida, courtroom.

0001147,"In To Kill A Mockingbird, what is a quote that proves that Tom Robinson was not involved in the murder because he is not left handed?","Tom Robinson could not have beaten up Mayella Ewell because he is crippled on his left side.
Early in the trial, Atticus establishes that Mayella was attacked by a left handed person, and that Bob Ewell is indeed left handed.
Atticus was trying to show… that Mr. Ewell could have beaten up Mayella. …If her right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to show that a left-handed person did it. (ch 17)
Scout is not impressed. She figures that Tom Robinson could just as easily be left handed, and then there is no reason for all of the fuss. After all, she is a child. She can follow most of the proceedings, but she does not see the bigger picture.
We see that Tom Robinson is crippled when they try to swear him in and he can’t keep his left hand on the Bible.
Thomas Robinson reached around, ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it. He guided his arm to the Bible and his rubber-like left hand sought contact with the black binding. As he raised his right hand, the useless one slipped off the Bible and hit the clerk's table. (ch 19)
Tom could not possibly have attacked Mayella Ewell. Since Atticus went to so much trouble to demonstrate that she was attacked by a left handed person, it did not take much to get the jury’s attention when they saw that Tom could not use his left hand.
Unfortunately, being physically unable to commit the crime was not enough for the jury. It was still a black man’s word against a white woman’s.
While Mayella is testifying that Tom Robinson assaulted and raped her, Atticus asks Mayella to identify her perpetrator. Scout recalls seeing Tom Robinson stand up for the first time and notices his obvious handicap. Scout says,
""He looked oddly off balance, but it was not from the way he was standing. His left arm was fully twelve inches shorter than his right, and hung dead at his side. It ended in a small shriveled hand, and from as far away as the balcony I could see that it was no use to him."" (Lee, 188)
The audience and the community of Maycomb know that Tom Robinson cannot use his left hand at all. The fact that Mayella was beaten predominately on the right side of her face indicates that the perpetrator lead almost exclusively with his left hand. Mayella also had bruises the entire way around her neck, which means that somebody with two good hands must have choked her. All of the circumstantial evidence suggests that Tom Robinson is innocent and that Mayella's father, instead, assaulted his daughter.
During Atticus's closing remarks, he mentions that this case is as simple as black and white and explains Mayella's reasoning for accusing Tom Robinson of rape. Atticus then mentions the evidence which suggests that Bob Ewell assaulted his daughter, given the fact that he is left-handed and Tom Robinson is handicapped. Atticus tells the jury,
""We don’t know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left."" (208)",unknown,False
0001148,Parents sue San Diego schools over CAIR ‘anti-Islamophobia’ lessons,"SAN DIEGO, Calif. – Numerous parents are suing the San Diego school district over an anti-Islamophobia campaign they believe is a “politically correct solution to a problem that does not exist,” attorney Charles LiMandri said.
LiMandri represents six parents who sued the school district because they believe the campaign bestows special protections for Muslim students and favors their religion over others, the
“No one is saying we have to have expensive, protracted litigation,” LiMandri said. “There can be a more commonsense approach to this where all students can be protected and no students are being favored to the disadvantage of anyone else.”
“It’s our position that the anti-bullying policies should protect all students regardless of ethnicity and affiliation, and they shouldn’t be singling out any religious group for special treatment, as they seem to be doing here,” he said.
The San Diego Unified School District’s new plan to combat bullying of Muslim students, approved in a 4-0 vote in April, adds more lessons on Islam to the curriculum to foster “understanding.” Those lessons are created in collaboration with the Council of American-Islamic Relations, which LiMandri and parents believe is working “to change American society and advance radical Islam,” the attorney told the
According to the AP:
The multiyear plan includes ensuring staff calendars include Muslim holidays, reviewing library materials on Muslim culture, providing resources to teachers and engaging in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations.
The district also plans to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture, create “safe spaces” for students and train staff about Muslim culture. The district is reviewing internal staff calendars to make sure Muslim holidays are recognized.
The move to protect Muslim students stems in part from a CAIR report from 2015 that allegedly found more than half of California Muslim students have been bullied because of their religion. District data also showed seven bullying incidents between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2016, though data doesn’t reveal which religions were targeted.
“That’s a relatively small number and it does not warrant or justify a wholesale change in the school district or its curriculum,” said LiMandri, who filed the federal lawsuit last Tuesday.
“It appears to us that this is a politically correct type of solution looking for a problem,” he told the Union-Tribune. “If Muslim students are being bullied, stop the bullying. But you don’t need to implement a program that is favoring Muslim students or one religion over another.”
SDUSD officials would not comment on the pending litigation, but have defended the special campaign to combat alleged Muslim bullying that they claim is “pervasive and vastly underreported,” according to the
“San Diego Unified does not favor any religion over another,” district director of family and community engagement Stan Anjan wrote in an email to the Union-Tribune in February. “We welcome all students from all faiths within our school community.”
The parents’ lawsuit alleges the district is violating students’ constitutional rights by favoring one religion over another, but does not seek monetary relief. Instead, LiMandri said parents want the district to ditch its affiliation with CAIR and work with parents to create an anti-bullying campaign that protects all students and isn’t centered on specific religions.

How many people over the course of your life, over the course of the recent past, months, years, how many people do you know that constantly complain about the media? Everybody, right? Everybody’s always complaining about the media. So over this past weekend I had somebody say, “Do you believe what Trump is doing to CNN?”
I said, “What do you mean what Trump is doing to CNN? It’s not what Trump is doing to CNN. It’s what CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post are doing to Trump!”
So many people have complained to me about the media for all of my life, the entire portion of my life that I’ve been doing this program. “Something’s got to be done. We’ve got to do something. Why doesn’t somebody do something about the media?” And here comes Donald Trump doing something about the media and people are getting nervous. Not everybody. Some people are obviously very supportive and happy about this.
I think it was last week or the week before, I forget which, but I openly stated on this program that we are witnessing the decline and eventual demise of CNN. And that statement was picked up by several in the Drive-By Media, and panels were assembled to discuss my premise. “Do you really think,” it was asked on Fox News, “do you really think this could be the end of CNN?” It is the end of CNN.
My point about this, a lot of people are nervous. Trump supporters are nervous about the tweet. Not everybody, but some Trump supporters are nervous about the tweeting and they’re nervous about him taking on CNN. For everybody who’s wanted something done about the media, this is what it looks like. For everybody’s who’s complained about “inside-the-Beltway-itis” and how it happens and says we need to drain the swamp or whatever, this is what it looks like.
It was never gonna be pretty. It was never going to appear rational or normal. I mean, this is a huge battle taking place that Donald Trump is waging single-handedly. Now, he’s got his supporters out there, don’t misunderstand. The social media army is out there supporting, and he’s not alone in this. But in terms of electoral politics he pretty much is alone in this, and he continues to take it to them. And they clearly do not know how to deal with Trump.
When I saw this, I was jealous. I was jealous that I didn’t do this. The video of Trump body slamming a CNN logo. I said, “This is great.” Trump didn’t do it. He just retweeted it. But it was clever, it was funny, and it illustrated once again that modern-day journalism and modern-day liberalism have zero sense of humor. The serious outrage that this was met with is highly illustrative of just where modern-day liberalism is and who they really are.
I mean, CNN literally went bat crazy over this. They were acting like this is a direct assault on all members of the media. This is promoting violence against the media. Meanwhile, the only people being shot out there are Republicans. The only people being shot are Republicans, and they are deranged supporters of liberals like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, and they are listening to all the rhetoric that the Drive-By Media, including CNN, is using to make them insane, to rev them up.
Here comes a guy on our side of the aisle using clever satire and parody, putting the CNN logo over the face of Vince McMahon, a video tape of Trump at a Wrestlemania a long time ago, CNN logo. (laughing) CNN can’t take it. CNN goes bonkers, claiming that this is going to cause violence against journalists. Meanwhile, the only violence taking place is against Republicans, and it is with guns, and it’s being perpetrated by deranged followers of left-wing news such as CNN, the New York Times, the Huff and Puffing Post, you name it.
I thought it was hilarious and funny. But it made some people nervous is my point. I saw a lot of people over the weekend and they said, “It’s just not presidential.” I said, “Look, the problem is Trump didn’t start this.” And I reminded every one of these people how every time I’ve talked to them over the years, at one point or another there’s widespread complaining about the media. And there’s always somebody in the group, “Somebody’s gotta do something.” Well, somebody is. And this is what it looks like.
This is exactly what it looks like, whether you’re taking on the media or whether you’re taking on any other branch of the Washington ruling class or establishment. I think while people are aware of the dislike and the unpopularity of establishmentarians of Donald Trump, I don’t think people have a full-fledged correct understanding of the sheer, raw hatred for Trump that they have. And that kind of hatred that they are carrying with them every day is dangerous. It’s destructive. It’s distorting. It is almost dehumanizing in a way.

0001153,"SO MUCH FOR OBAMA’S ""FLEXIBILITY"": Missile Defense Working Despite Decades of Democrat Resistance","Tuesday’s missile defense test in which a ground-based interceptor successfully intercepted an ICBM over the Pacific was both a warning to North Korea and another indication America is back. The test was in the works before Trump took office but it comes under an administration welcoming improvements in missile defense versus the prior Obama administration that used back-channels to try to give it away to Putin and the Russians. As the
The U.S. Missile Defense Agency successfully shot down a dummy warhead in space over the Pacific Ocean Tuesday during a test of a missile defense system that would protect the country from intercontinental ballistic missiles like the ones being developed by North Korea.
""During the test, an ICBM-class target was launched from the Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands,"" said a statement from the agency. ""A ground-based interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and its exo-atmospheric kill vehicle intercepted and destroyed the target in a direct collision.""
The irony of the interceptor being launched from a facility with Ronald Reagan’s name on it should escape no one. President Reagan dreamt of a multi-layered missile defense most derided as “Star Wars”. He dreamed of preventinig or deterring a nuclear attack, not merely avenging one. Perhaps he might have also had in mind the danger posed from rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran.
We see Reagan’s legacy in the Aegis missile cruisers and destroyers that can be deploted in troubled wters around the globe. We see it in the THADD theater missile defense recently seployed to South Korea. All of this President Barack Hussein Obama opposed.
Missile defense systems are systems which President Obama has long opposed as “Cold War” weapons. Soon after taking office, President Obama scuttled plans for ground-based missile defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic.
When President Obama took office in January, 2009, sitting on his desk were President George W. Bush’s plans for the deployment of ground-based missile interceptors, such as are deployed at Fort Greeely, Alaska, in Poland as well as missile defense radars in the Czech Republic, As
Yet within hours of Medvedev's election as president in 2008, the Russian announced that Moscow would deploy SS-26 missiles in his country's enclave of Kaliningrad situated between our NATO allies Poland and Lithuania.
He wanted the U.S. to abandon plans to deploy missile interceptors in Poland and warning radars in the Czech Republic designed to counter a future threat from Iran.
What did President Obama do? He caved in and notified the Poles in a midnight phone call on Sept. 17, 2009 — the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland — that we were pulling the plug on that system due to Russian objections.
Putin then watched in 2012 as Obama promised Medvedev at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, that after his re-election he would have more ""flexibility"" to weaken missile defense, which would help him fulfill his dream of U.S. disarmament.
Putin know full well Obama’s weakness in responding to any foreign threat to U.S. interests and security. President Obama was the Neville Chamberlain of our time, promising “peace in our time” as he invites war with weakness, apologies, and appeasement. It was he who colluded with the Russians to threaten American national security in the “back channel” conversation with Medvedev which fell victim to an open mic.
Thanks largely to President George W. Bush and his push to fulfill President Ronald Reagan’s dream, the continental United States and overseas allies are protected against missile attack by 30 deployed long-range Ground Based Interceptors (GBI), 32 Navy ships armed with over 100 SM-3 IA interceptors, and two dozen advanced SM-3 IB interceptors, dozens of Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors, and eight X-band missile defense radars deployed abroad.
It was Obama who proved to be Russia’s and Putin’s lapdog. Trump may have the chance to fire a second shot heard around the world, securing America’s freedom and very existence. When that pudgy little man-child gets his latest toy, just shoot that North Korean ICBM test down.",unknown,True
0001154,According To Major What Is The Cause Of The Animals Problems,"Old Major eloquently depicts the lot of animals. In chapter one, he says:
""Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty.""
In chapter two we see what actually happens in the farm. It is a confirmation of Old Major's ranting about the evils of humans. Jones and his men confirm all that Old Major said.
""June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On Midsummer’s Eve, which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of the World over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last they could stand it no longer.""
After the philosophy called ""Animalism"" is formed, the animals point out that men are the only animal that only consumes and never brings forth anything. Here is what the animals say:
""Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All animals are comrades.""
The problem, therefore, according to Old Major is that man is selfish and only uses the animals for his own gain without any consideration.
According to Old Major, man is the source of all the animals' problems. The animals have to wait on man for care because man gives the animals food. Yet, the only reason man is able to prosper is that the animals provide him with milk, meat, and eggs. Old Major wants the animals in charge of their own destinies--he wants to eliminate the humans from the farm because they are parasites on the system. By allowing the animals to keep everything they produce, the farm will run more efficiently and humanely. Not only does Old Major not like humans, but he dislikes anything associated with humanity, such as sleeping in beds, walking on two legs, and drinking alcohol. By taking away all the traits of humanity from the farm, Old Major hopes to create a Utopia.
The source of much of their troubles is of course Man and the fact that man makes them labor ""to the last atom of their strength,"" but it is in some ways not just man. It is the fact that they do not benefit from their great labor. They toil, as previous posters stated, until they have used up every last bit of their usefulness but they do not get to enjoy the fruits of that labor, man does. So the cause of their problems is the fact that Man profits from their work, he gets their eggs, their strength plows his fields, he eats the meat they grow on their bodies, etc. So once they are free of Man, ""the produce of [their] labour would be [their] own.",unknown,False

0001157,Harvey Weinstein’s ‘Casting Couch’ Sexual Harrassment Was Never Ok,"Within Harvey Weinstein’s incoherent
Indeed, some of the coverage on the Weinstein bombshell took this ball and ran with it. On NPR’s
“Well, yeah, a lot of what people are talking about now is that notion of the casting couch and how there was almost this kind of romantic notion placed upon it for many years,” Washington Post pop culture correspondent Elahe Izadi agreed.
As a sex worker, I admire the resilience and nerve of actresses of years past who leveraged these sorts of casting couch sexual transactions into fame. But their savvy working of a system in which their options were severely limited didn’t make that old system any less abusive. This appeal to the unspoken mores of old Hollywood — “romantic” or not — is no excuse for the sexual predation Weinstein is accused of.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with sex as exchange. If Weinstein had made an appointment with an escort, I wouldn’t condemn him for that. Indeed, Weinstein had the cash and connections available to him to have hired an escort every evening of his life if he were so inclined; Hollywood has a thriving sex industry, according to reports
An escort can refuse a prospective client if something doesn’t feel right. She can negotiate her rate, and she leaves when the session is over. She is employed specifically for sex and those conditions are clear, whatever the legal fiction must be about being paid for time. Whatever her economic circumstance, even as a survival sex worker, she usually doesn’t live under the sway of one client.
But instead of choosing to have transactional sex under those sorts of more equitable conditions, Weinstein is accused of propositioning women clearly under his power — low-level assistants and struggling actresses and models. Embedded in these propositions was not only the offer on the table, but also the threat of what would happen to a woman who refused.
“How do I get out of this room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” said Ashley Judd, recalling her thoughts twenty years ago when Weinstein pressed a massage on her in his hotel room to the New York Times. And that’s exactly it — Judd knew that alienating Weinstein and losing his backing were the economic stick behind the carrot of what Weinstein could do for her as an actress if she pleased him.
Sex worker theorists often point out that the reason that sex work is not valued as work is because it falls under the rubric of women’s care labor — things women are meant to do for free as a condition of being women. This was the logic behind pioneering sex worker advocate Margo St James and her organization COYOTE’s early alliance with Wages for Housework in the 70s. Make no mistake, sex work is work — and as such, it should not be an unwritten contract stipulation of every employed woman’s job. It should not be expected of a terrified, underpaid assistant locked in a hotel room with her naked studio exec boss demanding she give him a massage, worried that if she refuses she will lose her job. That stark imposition of power is rightly called sexual harassment.
“I am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career,” Lauren O’Connor wrote in her searing memo. “Harvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”
Based on these reports, Weinstein felt entitled to the sexual labor of women like O’Connor who were trying to make a living and a career. In the context of that vast power imbalance between him and the women he harassed, he felt entitled to demand it, wielding the implicit threat of firing or the socioeconomic Hollywood death of never eating lunch in his town again.
His entitlement used to be the unwritten law of the land, and it still is, in many places. That’s why many people — the same people who are aghast at the prospect of prostitution in conditions which are more explicit and autonomous — are still inclined to make excuses for Weinstein’s misogyny. Sex workers often comment that at least in sex work they are paid cash on the dollar for what they are coerced into doing by many legitimate employers as a condition of simply securing their jobs. Thankfully, the Times story and Weinstein’s abasement in the face of it demonstrates that many people are no longer so sanguine about sexual harassment, even the romantic Hollywood casting couch iteration of this sexual violence.

Sharpton says she attended an Usher concert for her 19th birthday and was invited backstage because of her birthday crown. A security guard then told her Usher was interested in her and asked for her number. After the show, she claims Usher called her from a blocked number and then asked if he could come to her hotel room.
“We spoke for a while and then we engaged in sexual contact. He never warned me about any STDs,” Sharpton claimed.
But here’s the gag: The 21-year-old says she DOES NOT have herpes. Sharpton is suing Usher because she feels her rights were violated as he knowingly put her health at risk without her consent.
Twitter responded to Quantasia Sharpton’s press conference and admitting she doesn’t even have herpes with a major side eye. Many believe she is lying, while others joked about everything from her looks to her name.

An unidentified woman in Ontario brought her son complaining of chest pains to a walk-in clinic on Sunday (Jun. 18). However, after being approached by a non-white doctor, the woman demanded to see a white doctor who “doesn’t have brown teeth and speaks English.”
“So, you’re saying, in the whole entire building there isn’t one white doctor? You’re telling me that my kid has chest pains and he’s going to have to sit here until four o’clock? Can I see a doctor that’s white, that doesn’t have brown teeth and speaks English?”
“God, what type of horrible country do I live in?” she complains after being repeatedly told the qualified doctors available don’t fit her racist demands.

Other agreed and also began to express their thoughts on the woman’s racist behavior. The woman claimed they were calling her out because she’s white.
“You’re brown and you’re attacking me because I’m white. It’s because I’m white… Being white in this country… I should just shoot myself.”

0001161,Tunisia Overturns Ban Preventing Muslim Women From Marrying Non-Muslim Men,"The right and freedom to marry, or not marry, the person of our choice is one of the most fundamental human rights today. Throughout history this has been a constant battle in a variety of different intersectional ways, and has also become an issue that can cause major divides.
Whether it be the fight for marriage equality so that same-sex couples can enjoy the same legal benefits as heterosexual people, or the fight for interracial marriage which has put many people’s livelihood at stake throughout history, especially here in the United States during segregation. But what about people of different religions getting married? One country has taken a major step forward for women’s rights through marriage, allowing women the freedom of this important choice.
Tunisia has just lifted a ban dating back to 1973 which forbade Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men. As

His office also released a statement about the decision, reiterating the importance of choice within marriage.

But even he didn’t dare push for equal inheritance,” explained the Al Jazeera article.
A number of the laws which disproportionately favor men over women are looked upon positively by some religious clerics, who disapprove of the President’s decision to overturn the 1973 marriage ban. However, as the

In the wake of the Arab Spring, Islamic leaders came to power initially, only to be voted out in 2014. After that, President Essebsi, who had held a number of positions in Parliament pre-revolution, came to power, promising prosperity and safety, as well as “reconciliation”, which is now being seen in the form of giving businessmen and civil servants of the old regime that now were being tried for past crimes, including torture, bribery and embezzlement, exoneration.
Amna Guellali from the Human Rights Watch said that the marriage ban being overturned in light of the reconciliation law was “one step forward, one step back” for Tunisia.
“For a long time, the old regime used progress on women’s rights as a fig leaf to distract from its repressive policies. By championing women’s rights while at the same time expanding impunity for acts of corruption, the Tunisian government is reminding us of how these two contrasted realities worked in the past and how women’s rights were used to whitewash a system riddled with corruption and systematic human rights violations,”
With the ushering in of a new constitution and a new government in the wake of a major revolution like that of the Arab Spring, we are no doubt going to see a lot of progressive measures tempered by moves that are seemingly regressive, as is the reconciliation law. The struggle for power is never an easy one, and throughout history, around the world, we have seen how many movements have left certain groups behind or ignored others.

At a boisterous campaign rally in Trump-friendly West Virginia, Trump slammed the investigation as a “fake story that is demeaning to all of us and most of all demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.” He commented hours after news broke that Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation, had empanelled a grand jury in the case.
“I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one, which is what the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve and what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve,” Trump told thousands of cheering, sign-waving supporters packed into an arena in Huntington.
Trump overwhelmingly won the state in the November election, partly due to his promises to revive a slumping coal industry.
The president, who remains agitated over the investigation into allegations of co-ordination between his campaign associates and Russian government officials, said Democrats have a decision to make.
“They can continue their obsession with the hoax or they can serve the interests of the American people,” he said.
Trump maintains there were no ties between his campaign and Russia and says no wrongdoing was committed. His frustration over the investigation peaked in recent weeks as he began attacking Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation. Sessions, most recently a U.S. senator, was an early and ardent Trump supporter.
“Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign. There never were,” he told the cheering crowd in West Virginia. “We didn’t win because of Russia. We won because of you.”
Trump argued that Democrats are pushing the “totally made-up Russia story” because “they have no message, no agenda and no vision.”
“The Russia story is a total fabrication. It’s just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics,” he said, referring to his victory over Hillary Clinton. “It just makes them feel better when they have nothing else to talk about.”

0001164,Could Grant’s Tomb Be The Next Monument To Go — Over Anti-Semitism?,"Statues of Confederate generals are being targeted for removal across the country as “hate symbols” in the wake of the bloody
But in New York, a monument to an iconic Union Army leader and U.S. president is the latest lightning rod for controversy.
Gen. Ulysses S. Grant’s alleged sin? Anti-Semitism.
At a press conference early this week, a reporter with a local
“I wonder if you think that somebody who did that, given the large number of Jews who live in New York, should be buried here New York,” the reporter asked.
De Blasio, who has set up a panel to review statues in the city, said he did not know. But the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, has said she supports a review of the future of the majestic tomb, which sits in Riverside Park overlooking the Hudson River near Columbia University.
It’s an unlikely controversy, as Jewish experts on Grant hold that he repented for the expulsion order and that in his term as president was a friend to the Jewish community.
The leading expert on Grant’s expulsion of the Jews, the Brandeis University professor Jonathan Sarna, is unequivocal on what he thinks should be done with Grant’s Tomb: It should stay.
“When one studies the totality of Grant’s life and actions, one discovers that he represents the fact that hatred can be overcome,” said Sarna, who has written a
“Grant apologized for the order, and as president went out of his way to prove just how unprejudiced he had become,” Sarna said. “He appointed more Jews to public office than all previous presidents; he became the first president to attend a synagogue dedication.”
Grant also intervened on behalf of Jews in Romania and Russia facing persecution, Sarna said.
The expulsion order, which in theory covered parts of Kentucky, Mississipippi and Tennessee, was never fully put into effect. According to Sarna, only a
“One really sees Grant as a man who grew in every way over the course of his life and career, and at least arguably that is something we should celebrate, rather than faulting him for what he himself considered to be a great mistake,” Sarna said.

0001165,Build that wall to block illegal immigrants,"America's immigration policy is in dire need of reformation. President Donald Trump is intending to improve our economy by reforming new immigration laws. One of his platforms is to build a modern wall between the U.S. Mexican border. His intention is not to thoroughly stop new immigrants from coming into our country but to control illegal immigrants from coming into the United States.
This policy has had a lot of controversy in our country, but it is only intended to keep America safe and strengthen our country. Due to the abundance of illegal immigrants coming into the United States, it is becoming a burden on our taxpayers and our social services. The amount of money we spend on illegal immigrants can be used towards providing services for our legal citizens that are in need of help.
The current fence that is built along the border is not enough protection against immigration, because there are still many immigrants who cross it illegally every day. With President Trump's proposal, it will hopefully improve border security and save taxpayers millions of dollars. It is time to put an end to illegal immigration and come to America legally.

The U.S. Department of State has discovered 2,800 government documents belonging to Huma Abedin on the personal laptop of her estranged husband, former New York congressman Anthony Weiner,
Abedin was deputy chief of staff to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Judicial Watch cites a lawsuit filed against the State Department as the source of the information.
The nonprofit initially filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking all emails sent or received by Abedin via a non-official email address.

0001167,‹ Infinity War: 8 Rumors That Are Likely To Happen (And 7 That Are Just Too Crazy),"At the end of Captain America: Civil War, the Captain ditches his Vibranium shield and goes to Wakanda away from the U.S. government and United Nations. Many people have taken this to mean that he is no longer Captain America, and they are right. The Infinity War trailer shows us Steve Rogers seemingly looking like Nomad from the comics — no star-spangled shield at all.
Some people have theorized that this means a new hero will take up the mantle of Captain America like in the comics (Falcon and Winter Soldier being the two primary candidates). We don’t think this will happen as Marvel will want to honor the memory of Captain America and let him and the mantle itself go out in glory. Furthermore, Falcon and Bucky are still fugitives.
When the Russo Brothers were considering how they were going to start Avengers: Infinity War, they said that they were going to do it by splitting the team. They did this early on in Phase 3 in Captain America: Civil War. In the end of that movie, Captain America and Iron Man went their separate ways, taking specific teams with them as well.
Iron Man and his comrades operated as government-registered superheroes while Cap and his Secret Avengers went to Wakanda for sanctuary. When Infinity War takes place, we’d bet that Iron Man will be primarily leading one team while Cap and Black Panther will lead the other. Keep in mind that we don’t see any of Cap’s Secret Avengers interacting with Iron Man’s team (save for that Scarlet Witch and Vision romance). This would also lead to them getting their butts kicked by Thanos, because they’re fighting him while divided.
The Cancerverse was an interesting part of the Multiverse in the comics. Featuring darker versions of our classic heroes, it played a major role in the “Thanos Imperative” storyline, where the Mad Titan had to work alongside a group of heroes that despise him: The Guardians of the Galaxy.
The reason we highly doubt the Cancerverse will make an appearance in the MCU is that it will be a concept admittedly difficult for general audiences to understand. On top of that, it would unnecessarily complicate an already big film. With all those characters, Marvel has to keep Avengers: Infinity War as simple as possible to allow every hero the right time to shine on the big screen. That alone will take up a lot of the movie.
If you remember back to Guardians of the Galaxy, the central conflict of that film involved the Orb which was actually the Power Gem. After the Guardians managed to get it back from Ronan the Accuser, it was given to the Nova Corps to be faithfully protected deep within the vault of Xandar.
In the Infinity War trailer, we see a shot of Thanos having both the Space and Power Gems in the Infinity Gauntlet. This means that he had to have gone to Xandar to steal the Gem from the Nova Corps. Considering the fact that Thanos isn’t exactly a diplomatic guy, he went into the planet guns blazing and burnt it to a crisp just to get his precious Infinity Stone. That may even be the event that tips off the Guardians to join the fight.
There was a big theory going around regarding the MCU and the Infinity Stones. Each letter of “Thanos” stood for what contained each stone. T-Tesseract, A-Aether, N-Necklace, O-Orb, S-Scepter. You might notice that the “H” is undetermined at this point. Many people have speculated that the “H” stands for Heimdall and that he contains the last stone.
Why we’re not on board with this one is that there’s never been a whole lot of evidence to support this, including the Infinity War trailer. Instead, we think that the last stone is hidden in Wakanda somewhere. Why else would Black Panther have to engage all defenses and fight against the Mad Titan’s army of monsters? To be fair, we also haven’t had the
Doctor Strange, as the Sorcerer Supreme and the omnipotent guardian of Earth, has been rumored to be the one that brings the Avengers together to fight Thanos. There are a lot of shots of him in the trailer to support this theory. However, that’s not the only contribution he is said to have among the team.
There is a rumor floating around that he will meet Scarlet Witch. After seeing her instability and how that translates into her powers, he will train her to control her abilities and master them. While they’re not exactly the same kind of magic-users, it’d be a great scene of pure comic book fun to see these two interacting and learning from each other. It’s funny to think that Strange would be training Scarlet Witch considering that she got her powers before he did.

0001169,Sen. Baldwin pushes to keep 'Buy America' in legislation,"(WLUK) -- President-elect Donald Trump is in the midst of his victory tour. He told the crowd in Cincinnati last week, the U.S. government has failed the interest of the American workers. And he plans to change that.
""Buy American, hire American. We're going to do it ourselves. That'll be our new mantra,"" said Trump to cheers from the crowd.
""I was heartened to hear those words,"" said U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin.
On Capitol Hill, Baldwin is finding agreement with Trump - if only on the fine point of ""buy America.""
Back in September, the Senate voted in favor a bill aimed to upgrade failing water systems. Baldwin included a measure requiring American made steel and iron be used on the taxpayer-funded projects.
The move would benefit companies like Neenah Foundry and its workers.
But Baldwin says a conflict arose last week.
""Speaker (Paul) Ryan and House Republicans removed the provision from the water resources Development Act,"" said Baldwin. ""It's just untenable. Stripping this 'buy America' reform I put in on the Senate side is only a giveaway, in my opinion, to foreign companies - Chinese and Russian steel producers - when we're expending taxpayer dollars.""
The water infrastructure problems took center stage during the presidential campaigns in Flint, Michigan, where lead pipes led to contaminated drinking water. Similar problems were also detected in other cities, including Green Bay.
Critics say directing federal funds to some companies over others would be unfair.
Ryan's office tells FOX 11 the ""buy America"" measure remains a ""materials requirement"" for certain federally-funded projects.
Baldwin and other Democrats sent House leaders a letter pleading to keep the ""buy America"" requirement from the Senate bill intact for the House to vote on. Baldwin and others even turned to Twitter to try and get Trump to stand by his word.
""He should not be silent this week as we're fighting to restore this ""buy America"" reform.

0001170,Alt-Right Jew: Charlottesville Was A Wake-Up Call,"Even after
As Jewish people, we can make psychic space for the rough anti-Semite, the uneducated man who hates us because he knows no better, the man in ripped jeans and rebel flag shirts. The “nerdy Nazis” with their polos, marching in Charlottesville can also be explained away, categorized, rendered less frightening. But a man who knows his vests? A man with a winning smile? This is an intrusion, a sign that the containment of the anti-Semitic virus has failed, that the good, the educated, the nuanced people of this world can no longer be assumed to be safe. No matter, though. I still tell people Richard is no Jew-hater. It’s impossible for a real anti-Semite to be so objective about Zionism, to go on Israeli TV… and to wear those nice vests.
No one, however, really cares.
After Charlottesville, all nuance is lost. I can’t blame my fellow Jews. The video, pictures and stories are awful. Hundreds

Jews still thinking the left has any interest in defending us against Nazis are fools. I’ve warned for quite awhile that the left will start seeing Jews as White, and the hatred and derision they pour upon white people is headed our way. There are countless vigils, teach-ins, Facebook posts from the left about Charlottesville and Nazis; few mention Jews. We feel this in our online spaces. Jews are an afterthought on social justice Twitter, an annoyance on leftist Facebook. Our concerns “get in the way” of the far more important issues for “people of color” — which of course we are not. I try to explain all of this to the Jewish race-warriors: turn our public discourse into race shaming, my peeps, and Jews will pay the price. We will always be the wrong race, under any formulation.

Oh yes, folks. David Duke. Der Stürmer. It’s worth noting that Caputo is not a recent college graduate — he’s a longtime reporter who has spent many years spent covering the Florida political scene. In this media environment, how is reasoned discussion even possible? We’re all reacting to something that wasn’t said, people who aren’t there. Mollie Hemmingway doesn’t have anything to do with David Duke or Der Sturmer, not even tangentially. So what? Marc isn’t responding to her. When thousands of people show up to beat up “Nazis” in Boston, there are no Nazis to beat up. So what? Someone has to be beat, so they just make-believe.
A week ago I was talking to some of the local Jewish wheels. They want to know how to handle these times. My advice? “Buy several of the same kind of semiautomatic rifle, that way you have barter items and spare parts.” A woman started crying. “Be sure,” I continued, “that if you operate a Jewish school, no one looking at the playground can see the children.” Jew-haters are especially set off by watching happy Jewish children.
It’s now early Sunday morning, long before the sun rises, and I’ve got candles lit because it feels right. I stare into the flames. So much has changed since the days of the campaign. Where did the fun go? Where’s the energy? What happened to the grand coalition of the disaffected? We voted for Trump because we knew those in power didn’t want us to. We sent a message, and now the message is gone. No one will listen to reason anymore. Antifa doesn’t care, Nazis don’t care, the media doesn’t care. I’m not a prophet and I don’t hear the voice of God, yet I can’t help but imagine Him looking down on us:
“You put politics before Me, this is your God now, this is what you wanted.”

0001183,Christians: Privileged or persecuted?,"According to a seminar at George Washington University, I’ve been getting “Christian Privilege” all my life! That’s on top of my patriarchal, white, gluten/peanut tolerating privilege!
But is that really true? Or is it one of those #FirstWorldProblems things?
Globally, the idea of Christian privilege is pure sophistry. Christians are the recipients of up to 80 percent of religious persecution around the planet, making it the
“But we’re just talking about the evil empire – the United States, David.”
OK – let’s consider that. Christians in the United States don’t blow people up; they don’t riot in the streets; they do billions of dollars of good work. But they are still persecuted. Examples:
None of that sounds “privileged” to me. One could argue that Islam is much more privileged that Christianity these days.
After 9/11, when Muslim terrorists killed 3,000 Americans, U.S. leaders went to GREAT PAINS to distance Islam from those guys who claimed to kill in the name of Islam. After 9/11:
Bottom line?
Islamic terrorists kill 3,000 Americans, and everyone runs around making sure no one offends Islam.
Faithful Christians refuse to pay for abortion drugs or believe in biblical marriage, and they are the Taliban and must be destroyed!
So in one sense in 2018, anyone that goes around claiming Christians have special “privilege” is cloistered from reality.
But, I must admit, here in the U.S., every person is a recipient of a specific type of Christian privilege. Here’s the truth. The United States is:
Why? Because of the Christian values and principles that informed its founding and governance. Christian values led to the forming of a country unlike any in history – dedicated to protecting the individual’s right to freedom and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
“But what about all the atrocities the U.S. has committed?” America has her flaws, but those flaws exist in spite of Christianity, when the U.S. has not fully embraced Christian values. And we work hard to right the wrongs: Slavery was the norm around the world, and we were the only nation in human history to fight a bloody civil war to end it.
In every election cycle, Barbra Streisand and her buddies declare they will leave the country if the conservative or Christian or Republican wins. And we wait, and we wait, but THEY NEVER LEAVE. THEY PROMISED! WHY WON’T THEY LEAVE?
Because there’s nowhere better to go.
Instead of “Christian privilege” seminars, there ought to be seminars everywhere on how you should thank your lucky stars if you’re an atheist, your lucky charms if you’re a witch, or whoever it is you worship, that you live in a country that was founded by Christians and/or those who respected Christianity and the Bible. Because you are more blessed than the 95-plus percent of the world’s population that lives elsewhere. You have freedom and liberty unlike any other people in history.",unknown,True

0001187,What The Facebook Search Warrant Means For Mueller’s Russia Probe,"It’s not surprising that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is interested in the role Facebook played in Russia’s campaign to influence the 2016 election. Yet, the
“This is not a wild goose chase, it’s not just a fishing expedition. [It shows] that there is good reason to be believe that someone committed criminal behavior, we just don’t know who that was and exactly what the behavior was,” Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor and former federal prosecutor, told TPM.
“Given the recent revelations, it’s hard to keep calling this a witch hunt,” she later added.
That Mueller had sought a search warrant for information about Russia ad buys on Facebook was alluded to
Getting a search warrant is a higher bar for Mueller to clear than a grand jury subpoena, another tool Mueller is using to obtain documents and testimony.
“To get a search warrant like that, you have to show a judge that there is probable cause that evidence of a crime will be found at the location,” said Harvard Law professor and former federal prosecutor Alex Whiting. “The fact that they got a search warrant shows that the investigation is moving forward and that they have found some evidence of crimes.”
Furthermore, former federal investigators tell TPM that it’s likely that the warrant Mueller obtained is tailored and focused in a way only possible if you have a good idea of what you think you’ll find.
“It has to be particularly described, what he is looking for,” said Asha Rangappa, who was a counter-intelligence agent for the FBI and now a Yale Law School professor. “A judge isn’t going to sign off some sort of blanket warrant that tells Facebook to turn over everything.”
Facebook
It wasn’t clear exactly what prompted Facebook, which is notoriously secretive about its internal operations, to come clean on what it found. Congressional investigators running their own Russia probes have since signaled their interest in what Facebook has learned about Russia’s involvement in politically-tinged Facebook posts.
A search warrant, however, would oblige Facebook to be responsive to Mueller in a way a voluntary request does not.
“For Facebook, voluntarily turning over the information may not be the approach they want to take because their image is, ‘We trying to protect privacy of people’s information,'” Levenson said. “A subpoena could be used, but I think in this situation the message their trying to send to the Facebook customers is, ‘We follow the law, but we’re not voluntarily turning over your information.’”
A question that has emerged since Facebook publicly admitted the presence of the accounts is whether the social media platform was the site of any criminal election law violations. Foreign nationals are prohibited from making political contributions — including money as well as other things “of value” — in U.S. elections. It is also illegal to aid and abet a foreign national’s contributions to a campaign.
A question for Mueller’s team is who was behind the Facebook campaigns and whether the Facebook activity qualifies as a contribution “of value” under federal election law.
Mueller also appears to be interested what sort of criteria was used by the ad purchasers in targeting the content, the Wall Street Journal reported. According to Rangappa, even some of the most sophisticated foreign intelligence operations may be unfamiliar with the nuances of American politics.
“If the targeted criteria was so specific that they would really need someone who would know American culture and campaigns to help them, who would that person be? Who would have that knowledge?” Rangappa said.
However, legal experts caution that a search warrant is by no means a predictor that the Mueller probe is heading towards an indictment.
“It doesn’t meant that they have found evidence of crimes committed by Americans — it could be crimes committed by Russians—and it doesn’t mean that somebody may be charged with a crime,” Whiting said.
“Some of these investigative moves, might be consequential and might be really leading to something, and some may be more crossing off less promising leads but making sure everything is chased down,” he added.",unknown,False

0001190,Trump Unloads At Freewheeling Alabama Campaign Rally For ‘Big Luther’ Strange,"Ostensibly in Alabama to boost the campaign of Sen. Luther Strange, President Donald Trump held forth for over an hour at a Friday night rally on topics including North Korea’s nuclear program, health care, Hillary Clinton, and the National Football League, at one point even promising the crowd that he would campaign for Strange’s opponent if he lost the primary.
“I told Luther if his opponent wins, I’ll be here campaigning like hell for him,” Trump told the Huntsville crowd, referring to former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore. He said Moore and Strange were “both good men.”
The Cotton State’s GOP primary has
At the Huntsville rally, Trump tried to shift this perception, insisting that Strange would not do McConnell’s bidding.
“He doesn’t know Mitch McConnell at all. Luther is a tough cookie,” Trump said. “He doesn’t kowtow to anybody.”
But the President didn’t exactly stay on-message, telling the audience that he was “taking a big risk” by involving himself in the primary because Strange, who has consistently trailed in the polls, could very well lose.
“I shouldn’t be doing it—the last thing I want to do is be involved in a primary,” Trump said, adding, “I might have made a mistake.”
Seconds later, though, he insisted Strange was “going to win easily” and could easily defeat a Democrat in the December general election.
The six-foot-nine Strange, who Trump said he had taken to calling “Big Luther,” faces a difficult road to victory in Tuesday’s primary.
“I don’t know who this guy is,” one Afghanistan war veteran told the Post of Strange. “I’m here for Trump.”
Those who showed up for a classic Trump rally got what they wanted.
The President again weighed in on North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s efforts to build nuclear weapons, calling him “Little Rocket Man” and assuring the audience that he was “going to handle it.”
He told the crowd, who broke into “Lock her up” chants when Trump mentioned Clinton’s name, to “speak to Jeff Sessions about that.”
Invoking his signature border wall, Trump said that it “has to be see-through” so that no criminals in “wonderful, wonderful” Mexico hit anyone on the U.S. side in the head when they catapult “a hundred pounds of drugs” over it.
And he spoke at length about NFL players protesting police brutality and racism by refusing to stand during the national anthem, calling it a “total disrespect of our heritage.”
Team owners should respond to those players, Trump said, by saying, “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired. He’s fired!”
“For a week, (that owner would) be the most popular person in this country,” the President continued, “because that’s a total disrespect of our heritage. That’s a total disrespect for everything we stand for.

0001192,SWAMP PEOPLE Chase Landry arrested for shooting at boat that wouldn’t slow down,"The son of Swamp People patriarch Troy Landry may have taken his pop’s famous “Choot ’em!” slogan a bit too far! Chase Landry, who is also one of the show’s stars, was arrested over the weekend after firing a gun at a shrimp boat while alligator hunting. Chase admitted to police that he shot at the shrimper because they refused to slow down “and would have sunk their boat.”
According to the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office, the chooting happened Friday night in Bayou Chene. From the TPSO:
TPSO water patrol deputies met with the victims at the boat launch on Old Spanish Trail Rd. in Gibson. The victims in this matter stated that they were traveling by boat in Bayou Chene when they were passing some guys in a boat who were hunting alligators. The victim stated that one of the guys from that boat shot a gun in their direction and continued towards St. Mary Parish. The victim stated that the suspect’s boat contained several alligators. There was a plastic gas can which was on top of the cabin of the commercial shrimp boat that was leaking gasoline from what appeared to be gunshot hole.
Chase Landry was later picked up in a traffic stop by St. Mary Parish patrol and taken to the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office, where he admitted to firing at the shrimp vessel. According to TPSO, “The suspect stated that he shot because the victim refused to slow down and would have sunk their boat.”
Chase (mug shot photo above) was charged with illegal discharge of a weapon and booked into the Terrebonne Parish Jail.

0001198,EXCLUSIVE: Security Source Details Bill Clinton Maneuver to Meet Loretta Lynch,"Attorney General Loretta Lynch. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)
Attorney General Loretta Lynch. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)
An exclusive interview with a security source who was present at the unplanned meeting Monday night on a Phoenix tarmac between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lorretta Lynch has shed additional light on an unusual summit that is embroiling the AG in charges of favoritism. As attorney general, Lynch heads the Department of Justice just as it is deciding whether to proceed with charges against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server during her tenure as President Obama’s secretary of state.
The source has decades of experience providing security to government officials. The source spoke to the Observer for 20 minutes and answered follow-up questions via text message on the condition that no further details be revealed, including even gender, given the possibility of losing his or her job as an active overseer of security arrangements. This person was on-hand for the entirety of the meeting and some of its aftermath.
According to this source, whose credentials were checked and confirmed by the Observer with sources inside both the FBI and the United States Secret Service, the attorney general was caught completely off guard by the meeting and the source dismisses suggestions that have been raised alleging that she waited there to see Bill Clinton or accommodated his request to see him. In fact, it seems from this source that it was Bill Clinton who was maneuvering for face time with the attorney general, because his plane had been scheduled to leave before hers arrived.
“Fair is fair. I’m a conservative-leaning [person] [gender-identifying word redacted]. I don’t support anything this administration does. I don’t know much about the attorney general’s past, except she has a good reputation. But I really don’t like this executive’s office, so that said, politically, that’s where I’m at. But I just happened to be in a position to know firsthand what went down that day.”
The FBI protects the attorney general and the Secret Service protects POTUS and there are elements from that agency that protect former presidents. According to the source, “The AG and the director each have a protective detail because they travel extensively and that duty falls to the FBI. They have a formalized unit, a detail, that lives and works out of Washington, D.C. Then there will be FBI leaders who are experts in other towns and regions who coordinate visits—someone in Chicago FBI will coordinate with the D.C. detail when the director or the AG comes to Chicago. So what happened here is that the FBI agents in Phoenix were in touch with the detail leaders in D.C. for the AG’s visit. Somebody from D.C. will advance the trip and liaise with the local element, who has a big SWAT team and provide everything they need so they can send only a skeletal unit with her, two people—a medic and protection. They don’t need to commit 27 people. Details include surveilling all the locations, the routes, the hospitals, safe zones; that’s all handled by [the local FBI people] [actual words redacted to avoid identifying source].”
According to the source, the FBI agents protecting Lynch “knew former POTUS was in town and another executive was coming and knew Lynch was coming so we knew there’d be congestion. We were waiting for her plane to touch down at the executive terminal area of Phoenix’s Sky Harbor where it’s best suited to control. Clinton’s plane was on the ground already. But he wasn’t there. We had been hoping to get him out before she arrived, just to avoid too much traffic. They [their planes] were 75 yards apart. We have a procedure we do to clear [space for] a motorcade. As we were ready to receive her, I saw the other motorcade coming in—we were like, ‘great timing.’ ”
The source was being sarcastic in saying “great timing,” indicating that it would have been better logistically for Clinton’s plane to take off before Lynch’s arrived, to avoid the congestion of two motorcades on the tarmac at once. The source indicated that Clinton’s people at the airport didn’t know what was taking Clinton’s motorcade so long to arrive and speculated that the delay was engineered specifically so that Clinton would not have left before Lynch arrived.
“Then I see Clinton walking over. His detail guys ran over to hers and said he’s coming. ‘He’s closing.’ He walked straight there to the Air Force guy at the door and next thing I know he’s going up the steps [of her plane].” Asked about the Air Force detail, the source later clarified to the Observer that “There was an Air Force airman at the base of the stairs of the [Lynch] aircraft, as you always see on TV with POTUS.”
According to the source, “Nobody knew this was coming. We just knew to be aware there were other events going on. There was no planned meeting. It was just chance contact. The fact is, he just started walking over. I don’t think it was pre-arranged. He just started walking over and [even her security] can’t tell him, ‘you can’t do that.’ He walked in her plane for at least 20 to 25 minutes and the FBI is standing face to face with the Secret Service and just chatting on the hot tarmac like, ‘what the hell.’ ”
Regarding the reaction and its aftermath, the source told the Observer, “I didn’t think of the political ramifications, just the timing, ’cause we had other things to do. He [Clinton] came off and shook the hands of the heads of Lynch’s detail. Then her detail finally got her off the plane, now much delayed, and departed for her day’s events. She had a series of visits planned for Tuesday.”
The source said that the impromptu visit made an immediate impression upon Lynch’s staff (meaning her non-security personnel).
“I don’t agree with her politics and all that, but I knew from the beginning that she got caught off guard and her staff was already talking about it that it’s going to be a political problem for her. Her staff was flipping out. We didn’t think about the political part until we saw her staff flipping out. For the security guys, it was more of a ‘I’ve got armed guys coming into my perimeter’ problem. But the staff guys saw right away that it was a political problem. After Clinton got off, they were like, ‘that wasn’t good.’ And I know from others who were in the actual car with her that her people knew immediately the political ramifications of it and were very upset.”

I still remember a time when I genuinely thought something along the lines of, “Fox News is right-wing, CNN is neutral and everything else is center-left.” I know, I was an idiot. But the last election really helped me pay attention and it was easily revealed to me what these news outlets really are – propaganda machines for the Democrat Party and progressive politics. With all the hysteria surrounding The Donald, it was as if the veneer of legitimacy was sandblasted off the maggot-infested wood of the house the mainstream media had built.
I still remember Donald Trump calling out these cretins.
But now, Americans are fighting back. There is a new movement to fight against these companies by cutting them off at the source. Millions of Americans are cutting their cable and satellite subscriptions as a form of boycotting these slugs. Just look at the whole
This is from a Bloomberg article:
“Investors in traditional TV providers are reeling as companies from AT&amp;T Inc. to Viacom Inc. fail to stop the desertion of customers lured away by cheaper entertainment options such as Netflix and Snapchat.
AT&amp;T, whose ownership of the DirecTV satellite service makes it the biggest U.S. pay-television provider, said late Wednesday it will report a third-quarter loss of 390,000 satellite and cable customers, echoing a similar warning weeks earlier from Comcast Corp. The same night, Viacom cautioned that its distribution deal with Charter Communications Inc., the second-biggest cable U.S. company, may lead to a blackout, potentially testing whether millions of viewers are willing to go without MTV and Nickelodeon.”
These companies are being cut off at the knees. There is nothing that would make me more proud to be an American than to see these companies starved of revenue and ultimately destroyed. All they have done is brainwash us and our children, to be constantly outraged, violent arms for the progressive agenda.

Two bills recently passed in that bat shite crazy state and neither of them are good for conservatives or anyone who respects lives and our God-given rights.
One of them provided
The other one allows a judge to issue an order for the confiscation of an individual’s firearms without their knowledge, let alone permission.
SB 719 allows a judge to issue an Extreme Risk Protection Order which demands a gun owner hand over all firearms as well as any concealed carry permit.
Based on a California law enacted in 2014, SB 719A would create a so-called “Extreme Risk Protection Order” (ERPO) that could be obtained by a law enforcement officer, family member, or household member in an ex parte hearing to deprive someone of their Second Amendment rights without due process of the law.
The ex parte aspect of the law means the bill does not require the gun owner to be present for part of the hearing in which the judge decides whether guns should be taken from him.
This is an atrocity and is a direct violation of the Second Amendment. If you’re a gun-totin’ Oregon citizen, you need to stand up to this and the rest of us need to make sure that this doesn’t spread to the rest of the United States.

0001202,Facebook bans white nationalist's accounts over hate speech,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Facebook has banned the Facebook and Instagram accounts of a white nationalist who attended the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that ended in deadly violence.
Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhraja tells The Associated Press that the profile pages of Christopher Cantwell have been removed as well as a page connected to his podcast. Cantwell was featured in a Vice News documentary about the rally and its aftermath.
Facebook has also removed at least eight pages connected to the white nationalist movement over what Budhraja says were violations on the company's polices on hate speech and organizations.
Cantwell, of Keene, New Hampshire, was listed on rally flyers and labeled an extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center. A former information technology worker who moved to New Hampshire from New York in 2012, the 36-year-old Cantwell describes himself as a white nationalist and said he voted for President Donald Trump. He has a podcast and blog that promote his views.
Cantwell says Facebook shut down his account in an attempt to silence him for his views. He also said his PayPal account had been closed. The company wouldn't confirm that because it has a policy of not commenting on the status of accounts.
""I'm not surprised by almost any of this because the whole thing we are complaining about here is that we are trying to express our views, and everybody is going through extraordinary lengths to make sure we are not heard,"" Cantwell said in a phone interview from an undisclosed location.
""Frankly, whatever you think of my views, that is very scary to me,"" he said. ""Facebook and Instagram is one thing but not being able to participate in the financial system because of your political opinions is something that, you know, people should worry about in America.""",unknown,False

The Russian Defense Ministry has stated,
“Following successful operations by Syrian troops, the last supply route used by the militants to deliver weapons, ammunition and material in the vicinity of Aqerbat is now within reach of the Syrian military’s firepower.
To prevent Islamic State militants from escaping to Deir ez-Zor, the Russian Air Force deploys drones for round-the-clock aerial surveillance, as well as detects and destroys armored vehicles, pickup trucks and other transport used by terrorists”.

0001204,Clueless Trump Supporters Sign ‘Impeach Hillary’ Petition – Video,"At a pro-Trump rally in Phoenix last month, Klepper had a little on-camera fun interviewing the attendees – who were clueless about his sarcasm. In fact, he got them to admit how they really feel, as well as getting some of them excited about a petition to impeach Hillary Clinton – who currently holds no public office.
The trailer for the show begins with Klepper telling one Trump supporter, “We’re anti-Oprah’s Book Club. We’re anti-Pho, not Antifa the movement, but the Vietnamese soup?”
“Aw, man, I love Pho, man,” the Trump supporter shot back.
“Why?” Klepper asked. “It’s basically just broth.”
Eventually, Klepper encouraged rally-goers to sign his petition to impeach Hillary Clinton.
“I hate her,” one Trump supporter said, and when asked if she’d sign a petition to impeach Hillary, she said, “Most definitely.”
Another Trump supporter, who was wearing the American Flag as a cape and a “Make America Great” cap, enthusiastically signed Klepper’s petition after he read the details out loud, “…to initiate [um] the proceedings, please sign below so we can oust Hillary from public office.”

We’re talking like a gaping hole at the bottom of a bag that is blowing in a gentle breeze. She is now giving out dangerously useless advice that reduces minorities and black people specifically to nothing more than their skin color, which is something we’ve been trying to avoid doing since the abolition of slavery. At least I thought so, until this moonbat opened her pie-hole.
In a town hall about civil rights held by the Congressional Black Caucus, Waters encouraged members of groups like Black Lives Matter and black people in general to “get controversial” and run for office.
And then she told them to do something that will never, ever help their cause.
She told them to use the race card.
“Let’s work with people who have the passion and you want to do it and to understand how important it is,” she said. “There are plenty of them in our community but guess what? We don’t associate with them because we think they are too controversial. Black people, you better get controversial. You better be controversial. You had better call it like it is. We have been shut down because others have defined us. When they said to us about 10, 15 years ago, oh, she’s playing the race card. You should say yeah, and I’ve got a lot more I’m going to play.”

You can’t rely on the color of your skin to prevent you from facing criticism and questions about your beliefs and your methods of bringing about change. That simply doesn’t fly in America anymore. If a group of white people got together and became politically involved, citing their skin color to shut down arguments about their beliefs and ideas, you’d call that “white privilege” and even “white supremacy.”
There was a time in America where African Americans wanted to be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin. Why are we letting these people take us back in time to a period that is taught as a cautionary tale?
The race card does nothing for you as a group, as a person or as a cause. It only shows that you are unable to argue your policies as a matter of logic and fact, and resort to meaningless things like skin color as a way to “win” an argument.
Waters, you should be ashamed of yourself for encouraging people you’re supposed to be empowering to rely on their skin color to take them places in the world.

The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) operates under the veneer of religion. Although their propaganda perpetuates the falsehood that they are killing in the name of Allah, the reality is that most ISIS fighters are being exploited for the benefit of war profiteers and Godless opportunists. Islamic theologians around the world agree that
Moreover, targeting people on the basis of Islamic religion is not an effective exercise for counterterrorism, considering that (1) ISIS is active in recruiting non-Muslim converts and (2) the vast majority of true Muslims are familiar enough with their religion to completely dismiss ISIS' manipulated interpretation of the Quran. In order to effectively combat ISIS and protect the world from their continued wrath, it is important for the presidential hopefuls to understand who exactly is being recruited into terrorism.
Prior to being conscripted, prospective extremists often aren't particularly religious and typically live on the margins of society. Recruiters target people who are in need to become their martyrs, and engage these prospects by temporarily filling — or simply making the false promise to fulfill — the needs in their life. For citizens of countries like Syria, Iraq and Tunisia, this means offering basic physiological sustenance to support their families: employment, food, money and/or safety from their wrath. For citizens of industrialized countries, like France, the United States, Canada and Australia, this means offering prospective recruits a sense of
Following the debate, many Muslim viewers on social media expressed that they felt Trump’s response was Islamophobic. Rhetoric that alienates the Muslim community for the actions of ISIS helps further the fabricated religious connection that fuels their perceived legitimacy. Moreover, denying refugee status for people trying to escape the Islamic State will also increase the sampling pool for ISIS recruiters. While the safety of Americans should be paramount to any commander in chief, the fact of the matter is that the current refugee vetting system is incredibly thorough. According to a report from the
Given these statistics and the humanitarian crisis in Syria, some would say that the United States has a moral obligation to take in more Syrian refugees. However, this cannot be done in a vacuum. Refugees in the United States often settle in lower socioeconomic areas. This puts them at continued risk of becoming the victims of crime and/or recruitment targets of organized crime groups. In order to responsibly accept refugees, America must continue vetting them thoroughly and provide adequate social and security support upon arrival and thereafter.
Ultimately, it is extremely difficult for a Syrian to become a refugee in the United States. According to the CATO Institute, there is a 0.042 percent chance of a Syrian refugee entering the United States after spending at least three years in a refugee camp. It is easier for ISIS to secure student visas, tourist visas and business visas, or to simply recruit lawful permanent residents or citizens in the United States. Although we may not know exactly who we are admitting in the short term, the risk is extremely low, and denying admission to refugees is much more dangerous — for them and us — in the long term.

0001210,Sheriff David Clarke: Our domestic security failure,"As another terror attack struck the homeland, this time returning to New York City, local politicians rushed to calm fears by parsing over whether it was an act of international terror or a “lone-wolf attack,” as if that matters.
In short order the FBI announced that an arrest has been made, which signaled to someone like me in law enforcement that we would learn the suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami was previously known to the FBI. He was.
We’re told that no probable cause existed to arrest Rahami before he attacked. We have seen this response over and over again. Although true, that statement also reveals a deeper, systemic problem.
ISIS has declared war on America. We need to use a war model to prosecute this campaign and instead we are using a law-enforcement model which seeks probable cause to arrest, a very high standard often times not achievable until after an attack (crime) occurs and then enough evidence that will stand up in a court of law. The actors, whether part of an international organization or radicalized American citizens, are enemy combatants, not common criminals.
As soon as the planning stage begins they should be picked up and held indefinitely, preferably at Gitmo.As a law-enforcement leader who deals with domestic terrorism and attacks on our population on the front lines, it is imperative that I relay one crucial bit of intelligence from my end: we are not structured properly and thus unable to defend the homeland adequately until our domestic intelligence apparatus changes drastically.
The mission of a true intelligence agency is to disrupt, prevent and detect terror attacks before they occur. An arrest is not necessarily the goal. Informing decision-makers in enough time to act is the goal.
I have been sounding the alarm about this for the past several years, but it is up to Americans to demand a change from their government. Our lives continue to be lost, people maimed, and populations increasingly terrorized, for the simple reason that we have put the wrong organization with the wrong mission in charge: the FBI.
President Obama declared this great work even though 29 people were injured and a million others psychologically damaged. It was an intelligence failure.
Americans respect their law enforcement and their government, but there comes a point when we have to ask for some accountability from those tasked with this job.
Right now, the FBI is the lead domestic security agency. As in nearly every other attack they looked, found no probable cause to arrest and turned away.
Continuing to ask the FBI to handle domestic security is wrongheaded and dangerous for one simple reason: the FBI is structured to investigate law violations, not produce intelligence. The FBI reports directly to the Department of Justice Attorney General—a highly politicized entity—and must establish the high standard of “probable cause” as part of their investigative approach to domestic security.
If there’s no viable case early on, as DOJ officials instruct, the scrutiny of a potential terrorist becomes a matter of wasted resources. Dangerous men and women fall off watch-lists and more Americans live in fear waiting for the next attack.
In the wake of recent attacks on American soil, from Orlando to San Bernardino and now Minnesota and New York City, it is clearer than ever that the FBI’s law-enforcement approach is unable to disrupt enough fatal and dangerous attacks against our domestic targets before they happen.
President Obama has offered a solution: the pathetic, weak, and un-American, “learn to live with it.”
That kind of capitulation to hate and murderers is not acceptable to me, nor should it be to any American. We don’t give up or change our way of life like at airports simply to protect a bureaucratic system that is failing, or because we are afraid of truly taking on an enemy intent on destroying Western culture.
We require the proper organization and organizing mission that focuses instead on identifying potential threats, establishing what capabilities they have, determining if an attack is being planned, and alerting decision-makers.
This organization does not exist here as of yet, but it needs to, and quick. A new entity focused on protection, not prosecution, is the only way to protect Americans.
We live in a new era; like it or not, the enemy is at war with us, and they’ve come to our home soil. This isn’t the time to plant rose bushes and go about our daily lives, it’s time to assess, adjust our protocol, and stand up for American lives.
President Obama isn’t doing it. The media isn’t able to even articulate what this war is about. It’s up to the American people to demand that a new domestic security entity take up the protection of the homeland.

0001211,"Brent Budowsky: McCain, VFW shame Trump on Gold Star family","Every day the evidence mounts that Donald Trump, the presidential candidate favored by Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, is temperamentally, intellectually and morally unfit to be commander in chief of the American military.
The latest example of Trump’s disastrous ignorance and ideas about national security is his insulting treatment of the Gold Star mom and dad of the intensely patriotic and heroic Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in action saving the lives of others who were risking their lives to defend our country alongside him.
Today Sen.
In a deeply patriotic and passionate 697-word statement, McCain discussed at length his family tradition of military service and his outrage against the insults Trump directed against Khan’s mother and father. He also correctly noted that Trump’s extreme position against immigration of Muslims into America would have prevented Muslim-American heroes such as Khan from coming to America, serving our country and saving countless lives.
And I would add that many military and intelligence leaders, including David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director, have condemned Trump’s ideas against Muslims as providing aid, comfort and support to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and other terror groups that seek to attack America.
Also today the Veterans of Foreign Wars, one of America’s largest and leading veterans organizations, which represents those who wore the uniform over many generations, added its national voice to the condemnation of Trump’s insults against the Gold Star mother and father of Capt. Khan.
McCain, the VFW, veterans groups and patriotic Americans of all persuasions treat respect of Gold Star mothers as a sacred trust, which Trump violated — just the latest example in the litany of insults that he has directed against one group of Americans after another.
McCain continues to reluctantly support Trump and the future will tell if his support will continue; as the VFW’s statement notes, our respect and admiration for Gold Star mothers and fathers transcends all partisan and electoral considerations.
I do not support Trump. In fact I believe his insults against the Khans is only the latest example of why I and many others believe that Trump as commander in chief would be a major national risk to America’s national security and those who serve to protect and defend it.
Over the weekend the GOP’s nominee stated that Russia has not intervened in Ukraine, a false and ignorant statement that is universally known to be incorrect.
Not long ago he told The New York Times, doubling down on this statement since, that if Russia invaded Europe he would not come to Europe’s defense if he believed that European nations did not meet his standards of defense spending. It is unprecedented for any American president since the creation of NATO, Democratic or Republican, and for any leader of any European democracy, conservative or liberal, to state that the United States might not defend Europe from a Russian invasion and an attempt to establish a Russian dictatorship over any nation that belongs to NATO.
Trump has repeatedly stated that he would order American troops to commit acts of torture if he is elected, which some leading retired military commanders have already stated they would refuse to obey because it would constitute an international war crime and make American prisoners of war vulnerable to torture from our enemies.
Leading intelligence professionals now believe that Russia has embarked on an aggressive campaign of espionage and cyber warfare and information warfare against America designed to attack
Make no mistake. In the most important sense Russia is waging an undeclared war against America, conducted not with troops and bombs but with cyber warfare, to hack our systems and information warfare to leak information received through espionage, to help Trump, and to defeat Clinton, at crucial moments such as the Democratic National Convention.
After the Russian espionage was revealed, Trump took the inexcusable action of publicly supporting and encouraging this Russian cyber invasion of America, in this Russian attempt to help Trump become commander in chief. Trump repeated this view a number of times, and tried to retreat by laughably pretending it was just a bad joke.
Regarding this latest Trump insult against the Khans, the loud and rising chorus of condemnation may well force Trump to retract his comments. But whether or not this happens, what Trump said attacking and insulting a Gold Star mother and Gold Star father is one more example of why America should never allow his finger to be on the nuclear war button, and why voters should never allow a man with his temperament and vices to be commander in chief.

0001212,Dick Morris: Why Obama spared ISIS oil,"Last week, on the “Charlie Rose” show, former Obama CIA Director
Morell said that “we didn’t go after oil wells, actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls, because we didn’t want to do environmental damage and we didn’t want to destroy that infrastructure.”
If ever a statement by a former administration official offered a glimpse into the looney priorities of the Obama administration, this is it! We did not bomb the oil fields upon which ISIS depends for the bulk of its revenue because of our concerns about adding to the carbon emissions that promote global warming (in the desert).
So we let ISIS rake in millions of dollars every day, selling about 100,000 barrels of oil at an average of about $20/barrel (discounted) for a take of $2 million every day. ISIS may be led by radical, crazy jihadists, but the rank and file of the ISIS military is reported to be paid soldiers fighting for money. Cut off the money and you cut off the army.
But Obama put the minor, incremental damage of destroying the oil fields ahead of the need to stop ISIS from rampaging through the Western world, killing people at random. He apparently worried that the effects of destroying the oil wells could be severe.
This kind of environmental fantasizing was in vogue during the Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein’s destruction of all of Kuwait’s oil fields was thought to be likely to cause huge damage. Paul Crutzen, a noted atmospheric scientist, predicted that a “nuclear winter” might ensue with a cloud of smoke covering half the Northern Hemisphere for at least 100 days. Carl Sagan argued that the effects of the destruction of Kuwaiti oil fields could be comparable to the explosion of the volcano Tambora in 1815, which produced “a year without summer.”
It never happened.
Scientist Patrick K. Dowling wrote, in his study “The Meteorological Effects of the Kuwaiti Oil Fires,” that the smoke only affected the weather pattern throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991. A 1992 study found that emissions of carbon dioxide were only 2 percent of global emissions. Big deal.
Remember that Kuwait produced about 2 million barrels per day before the Gulf War — at least 10 times as much as the ISIS oil wells generate. The Kuwaiti fires dwarf anything destroying the ISIS oil wells would produce when it comes to any harmful environmental effects.
Why isn’t Obama using our air power to attack tankers carrying ISIS oil to refineries in Turkey? Again, we wanted to fight the world’s first green war. As Morell put it, “There seemed to have been a judgment that, look, we don’t want to destroy these oil tankers because that’s infrastructure that’s going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn’t there anymore and it’s going to create environmental damage.”
Once again, Obama wants to fight terrorism, but everything else comes first.
Morell noted that the administration didn’t even want to hit oil trucks carrying fuel from ISIS oil fields.
To enter the mind of Barack Obama and see the low priority he accords fighting terrorism is to see a nightmare unfolding. How can we trust him to keep us safe and to keep out ISIS terrorists who have so thoroughly infiltrated the ranks of Syrian refugees?
With Obama, protecting Americans from terror comes in last in his list of priorities.

0001213,Juan Williams: Trump's race politics will destroy GOP,"Now for some startling opinions about race relations and the current leader of the Republican Party, Donald Trump.
In the opinion of 50 percent of all Americans, the word 'racist' fits Trump either ""very well"" or ""somewhat well,"" according to a July poll from the Associated Press and GfK. Most of those people — 35 percent of the overall population — said the term fits the GOP nominee ""very well.""
Here’s another eye-opening opinion: Most Americans, 56 percent, “believe that Trump is biased against women and minorities,” according to an August Washington Post poll.
Last week, Democratic presidential nominee
But Clinton’s words simply amplified what Speaker
The damage Trump is doing to the GOP is evident in polls showing more than 12 percent of registered Republicans intend to vote for Clinton. GOP-leaning independent voters are staying away from Trump, too. The latest Quinnipiac poll had Clinton with 51 percent support and the Republican nominee fading.
As a result, the GOP is now likely to lose control of the Senate and lose seats in the House in the fall election.
And yet Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader
Much of the damage is directly tied to Trump’s racial politics.
Long before Trump, the GOP already had few black and Latino elected officials. The party is in desperate need of more women as well as racial and ethnic diversity to keep up with the reality of the nation’s changing demographics.
A wider range of people backing conservative principles — from small government and low taxes, to free trade and policies supporting strong families — is not tokenism. It is a necessity if the party is to remain relevant to policy debates and have any chance of winning in the future.
And there are churchgoing, family loving black people, Latinos and immigrants who share those values but see the GOP as an exclusively white party.
The potential power of a racially diverse GOP was on display this year in the ongoing controversy over police use of excessive force against blacks. The debate was an exercise in polarization between Republican law-and-order voices backing the police and Democrats backing the controversial Black Lives Matter group when Sen.
Even in a business suit and wearing a lapel pin signifying that he is a member of the Senate, Scott recalled being treated like a criminal suspect by Capitol Police: “The officer looked at me, full of attitude… I was thinking to myself, either he thinks I’m committing a crime — impersonating a member of Congress — or what?”
As a black man, a conservative and a Republican senator, Scott said he has “felt the anger…that comes with feeling like you are being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.”
And when the Ku Klux Klan’s former Grand Wizard endorsed Trump by saying it is “treason” against white heritage to fail to vote for Trump, Scott again spoke up:
“Any candidate who cannot immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party,” he said. “If Donald Trump can’t take a stand against the KKK, we cannot trust him to stand up for America against Putin, Iran or ISIS.”
Scott’s stand against Trump now can be seen as an early storm warning. As Labor Day approaches, the awful reality of what Trump has done to the GOP goes beyond polls showing Trump is on track to lose more than 90 percent of the black vote and around 80 percent of the Latino vote.
The real issue for the GOP is that the latest polls have him losing white women with college degrees. That is devastating to the Republican brand.
Trump’s recent speeches about black America to overwhelmingly white audiences — asking black people “what the hell do you have to lose?” by voting for him — is an effort to regain the support of white Republicans who do not want to vote for someone viewed as a bigot.
Trump established himself in national Republican politics five years ago by pushing the racist conspiracy theory that President Obama was not an American citizen. Trump’s shameful stoking of this effort to undermine the credibility of the first black president remains an issue.
A disturbing poll from NBC News/Survey Monkey taken earlier this month found that a shockingly low 25 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement “
The GOP’s problem with black voters didn’t begin when Barack Obama became president and it won’t end when he leaves the White House.
Even as he swept 49 states in his 1984 reelection, Ronald Reagan only won 9 percent of the black vote. George W. Bush fared only slightly better in his 2004 re-election, netting 11 percent of the black vote but put blacks in his cabinet, notably Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice.
Ryan, to his credit, has tried to follow in the footsteps of his mentor, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who famously toured black communities promoting economic growth with “empowerment zones.”
Trump is squandering those decades of efforts on race by Republicans.
Ryan, McConnell and Priebus need to dump Trump and save their party.

0001214,Juan Williams: Clinton spoke the truth on 'deplorables',"She called out the haters, the bigots and the racists as a “basket of deplorables.”
David Axelrod, President Obama’s former top political guru, called Clinton’s words a “mistake” that might allow Republican nominee Donald Trump to “seize the high ground.”
The New York Times’ liberal editorial page similarly concluded “real damage had been done” because Clinton had written off a group of voters by saying they were “irredeemable.”
Sally Kohn, the left-leaning CNN commentator, wrote in The Washington Post that “what is, in fact, deplorable is not only that Clinton said this but that she apparently believes it.”
Kohn explained that while Trump is clearly “running a xenophobic campaign that’s pandering to white nationalism,” most of his supporters are filled with “resentment that is partly about identity but also about economic suffering.” Clinton, Kohn argued, “should be reaching out to these voters, not offending them.”
This line of thinking from influential white Democrats reminded me of a line in President Reagan’s 1989 farewell address: “Don’t be afraid to see what you see.”
And here is what I see:
""No, I'm not in the name-calling business,” Pence responded, refusing to condemn an indisputable racist and Trump supporter.
Instead, Pence complained: ""What Hillary Clinton did Friday night was shocking. I mean, the millions of people who support Donald Trump around this country are not a basket of anything.""
And then I saw Trump’s son, Donald Jr., post an image of his dad, Pence and Alex Jones.
Jones is best known for advancing the conspiracy theory that the U.S. government was behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed almost 3,000 people. Jones has also suggested the government is putting chemical additives into juice boxes, intending to make children homosexual to control population growth. And Jones claims the massacre of school children at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 was staged as part of a government plot to enact gun control and that no children were actually killed there.
Trump has praised Jones for “his amazing reputation” and appeared as a guest on his show during the GOP primaries.
Earlier this month, Trump Jr. tweeted an article from Jones’ website which stated that Hillary Clinton was wearing an earpiece during a forum with Matt Lauer on NBC News. Clinton was not wearing an earpiece, of course.
At a Trump rally last week in Asheville, N.C., a 69-year-old woman protesting against the GOP nominee at one of the candidate’s rallies was punched in the face by a Trump supporter. She later called a North Carolina television station to ask if people found a Trump supporter punching her in the face ‘deplorable’?
So, I see a lot of deplorable behavior. But some political thought-leaders — including some Clinton supporters — prefer to excuse it as the actions of a few misguided people and not representative of most Trump supporters.
Can we determine if close to half of Trump supporters hold deplorable beliefs? Let’s go to the polls.
An April poll taken by Reuters found that a large percentage of self-described Trump supporters describe black people as more “lazy” than whites (40 percent), “less intelligent” than whites (32 percent), more “rude” than whites (44 percent), more “violent” than whites (48 percent) and more “criminal” than whites (46 percent).
Another Reuters poll taken in July found that 58 percent of Trump supporters have either a “very unfavorable” or “somewhat unfavorable” view of the entire religion of Islam.
These are racist views. If they do not count as “deplorable,” then the word “deplorable” no longer has any meaning. By the way, a Washington Post/ABC News poll has 60 percent of Americans agreeing that Trump is personally “biased against women and minorities.”
Another shocking poll from NBC News/Survey Monkey taken in August found that just 27 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement “
Trump burst on to the national political stage five years ago as the “birther-in-chief,” perpetuating this overtly racist conspiracy theory about the first black President of the United States. Only last week did he finally — and briefly — acknowledge that Obama was born in the United States.
As she prepares for her first debate with Trump next week, Clinton needs to unapologetically remind voters — especially traditional Republicans who are uncomfortable with seeing their party overrun by extremists — of the racist, paranoid fringes that Trump has invited into the nation’s politics under the banner of the Republican Party.
Clinton laid the groundwork in a speech in Nevada last month when she declared that ""a fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party.""
She accused Trump of “disregard for the values that make our country.""
After being scolded for her ‘deplorables’ comment, Clinton backtracked. She explained that she was being “grossly generalistic…I regret saying ‘half’ – that was wrong.”
Clinton should not have apologized. Calling out the bullies and the bigots in a national presidential election is brave. Listen to her running mate, Sen.
“She advanced the notion that if you’re chumming around with the head of the KKK … that’s deplorable,” Kaine said. “You’ve got to call that out. If you’re attacking immigrants, that’s deplorable. If you’re attacking LGBT Americans, that’s deplorable. If you’re attacking people because they’re Muslims, that’s deplorable.”
To quote President Reagan once again: “Don’t be afraid to see what you see.”

0001215,Markos Moulitsas: The real terrorist threat,"It’s tough being a conservative these days.
After attacking President Obama as “weak on terrorism” for nearly seven years, the nation hasn’t suffered a single terrorist attack even remotely like the 9/11 terrorist attack during George W. Bush’s presidency or the Beirut barracks bombings during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. As much as conservatives claim that Democratic policies harm the nation, it’s Republican administrations that have had the weakest record when it comes to keeping our nation safe.
In fact, one could argue that conservative policies are a root cause of terrorism, whether it is encouraging a foreign policy that breeds new terrorists overseas or cheering on the kind of lax gun laws and racist xenophobia that enable domestic terrorists such as Dylann Roof in South Carolina. After all, it’s no accident that Donald Trump inspired two Boston brothers into beating a Latino homeless man senseless.
Violent right-wingers certainly don’t lack passion. In a study by the United States Military Academy, American Muslims accounted for 20 successful plots since 9/11, leading to 50 fatalities. In contrast, right-wing extremists averaged 337 attacks per year, killing 254 people. And those numbers have only increased since the study was published in 2012. Meanwhile, the government’s ability to monitor and thwart such attacks was crippled by conservative anger over the 2009 Department of Homeland Security report detailing the danger from this violent fringe.
And then there’s terrorism enabled by our nation’s lax gun laws. According to the Mass Shooting Tracker, there have already been 273 shootings in which more than three people were wounded or killed people this year, killing a total of 346 and wounding 1,004. But like right-wing violence, conservatives don’t consider this epidemic “terrorism,” proving their definition is conveniently narrow enough to exclude any violence that doesn’t justify their next war.
With the dearth of successful Islamist attacks on this country, it’s only mildly surprising that a conservative like 20-year-old Joshua Goldberg would try to spark things into action.
Goldberg worked closely with conservative news outlet Breitbart on efforts to discredit the Black Lives Matter movement, tried tirelessly to smear human rights groups including the Human Rights Law Center and Amnesty International, and was an avid participant in the “Gamergate” movement, a misogynist effort to drive out feminists from the video game industry. And last week, Goldberg was arrested for conspiring with a supposed agent of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to bomb a 9/11 vigil service in Kansas City, Mo.
According to the indictment, Goldberg didn’t just advise the would-be terrorist on how to build a bomb, he also advised him to dip the shrapnel in rat poison so that victims’ wounds wouldn’t clot, thus increasing their chances of bleeding to death.
It seems incredible that right-wing conservatives would go to such great lengths to harm fellow Americans, but there is a palpable sense of desperation among the radicalized fringe as American culture leaves them behind. They have spent years claiming that Obama’s every step will lead to a loss of “freedom” and the Islamization of this country, yet Americans now widely embrace marriage equality, racial and religious tolerance, and even ObamaCare. The nation’s deficit is down, the economy and job picture are improving, healthcare costs are contained, and
So when reality doesn’t confirm your crazy ideology, why not give it a little helpful push? Luckily, Goldberg was caught in time. Hopefully, the next conservative wacko doesn’t fall through the cracks.

0001216,Markos Moulitsas: America under siege?,"""CRIPPLED AMERICA” screams the title of Donald Trump’s new book, overlaying his pouty face. The subtitle? “How to Make America Great Again.” Given GOP screaming about American exceptionalism and superiority, it’s kind of surprising the party’s presidential front-runner is overtly arguing that America is less than great.
Then again, that’s a common theme among Republicans, who unreservedly describe today’s United States as a nightmarish hellhole.
“[Our society is] very much like Nazi Germany,” said Ben Carson. “I know you’re not supposed to say ‘Nazi Germany,’ but I don’t care about political correctness. You know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.”
In the mind of Carson — Trump’s chief rival for the nod in 2016 — Americans are getting sent to concentration camps, while the unlucky citizens who have survived are just slaves because they can now get affordable healthcare.
“ObamaCare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government.”
So President Obama’s murderous police state is a nightmare and must be opposed? Well, unless you’re the wrong color.
“[
In the conservative imagination, the government is run by despotic slave-owning Nazis, but the police state lacks police because they’re all being murdered.
Meanwhile, Carly Fiorina got a couple of weeks’ mileage and a minor poll bump by indulging in outright fantasy about Planned Parenthood during one of the Republican presidential debates: “Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, ‘We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.’” Maybe a Nazi cop could’ve put a stop to it, if he hadn’t been murdered by a Black Lives Matter activist! (And if Planned Parenthood were doing what Fiorina says it’s doing, which it’s not.)
And heaven knows Christians just can’t catch a break in this country anymore. “Christian convictions are under attack as never before,” claimed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who’s polling at 3 percent in the RealClearPolitics survey. “Not just in our lifetime, but ever before in the history of this great nation. We are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity.”
But while Christians are under siege, Muslims are apparently running rampant in this country.
“Without exaggeration, the Obama administration will become the world’s leading state sponsor and financier of radical Islamic terrorism,” said Texas Sen.
And then there are all the jobs the Obama administration has killed. The Environmental Protection Agency is killing jobs. ObamaCare is killing jobs. Investing in green energy is killing jobs. Our current Kenyan socialist communist president has killed so many jobs that no one has a job anymore.
Sure, in the real world the economy set a record with 63 consecutive months of job growth, but don’t try to let reality intrude into the conservative bubble. Their America is a hellhole, and they’re sticking with their fantasy ’til the bitter end.

0001217,"Budowsky: Obama, you’re wrong about Sanders","On Monday, President Obama scolded journalists for not covering the substance of the presidential campaign. I entirely agree.
Where I disagree with the president is when he criticizes
Obama is wrong — and insulting to voters — when he suggests that they need him or the media to determine whether they should put their faith in Sanders. Sanders supporters know exactly why they are supporting the Vermont senator.
Sanders and his supporters believe — and I entirely agree — that Democrats should stand for powerful transforming change. They believe Democrats should mobilize armies of small donors and workers to support that change and should motivate more voters to come out on Election Day to elect more Democrats to the House and Senate, so that the party can negotiate with Republicans from a position of strength and a mandate for change.
Obama and Democrats should consider with prayerful reflection why, since Obama became president, Democrats have lost control of the House, the Senate, governorships and state legislatures across the nation. It is fact, not opinion, that Democrats have suffered extreme damage at all levels during Obama’s presidency, because too many Republican voters were motivated to vote and too many Democratic voters were not inspired and stayed home.
Before Obama further insults the intelligence and idealism of Sanders supporters by suggesting he knows better than they do about which candidate they should put their faith in, he might consider this: The sum of all polling, according to RealClearPolitics, finds that Sanders would defeat every Republican opponent in a general election, would defeat Trump by an epic landslide margin of more than 17 percent and runs stronger than
My answer to Obama’s speech to journalists is not that Democrats should support Sanders or Clinton, but that it is profoundly unwise and destructive to Democrats for the president to gratuitously criticize Sanders and insult those who put their faith in him. Regardless of who is nominated, Sanders is a major part of the solution to the challenges that Democrats face, and when Obama criticizes Sanders he becomes the problem, not the solution.
Make no mistake, Hillary Clinton is the probable nominee for the Democratic Party, and if she is nominated I will work like hell to get her elected. But make no mistake about this, either: Bernie Sanders still has a chance to win a majority of elected delegates, and he and his supporters should be respected.
Sanders has touched a chord in American politics. He speaks to the heart of many Democrats. He offers the conviction politics of authenticity and principle that Americans hunger for and find sorely lacking in politics today. He thrills young people, appeals to independents and attracts blue-collar workers who might otherwise be tempted by Trump.
If Obama wants to help his party do better than it has done so far on his watch, while offering high praise to Clinton, he should speak of Sanders with respect and admiration, not condescension and contempt. If he wants to elect more Democrats to the House and Senate, he should sing the praises of Sanders for inspiring small donors to give him more than $43 million in February, and he should offer those small donors a standing ovation worthy of their great aspirations. Then, perhaps, they will donate to progressive Democrats running for the House and Senate regardless of who is nominated for president.
For the same reasons that Sanders should avoid negative attacks against Clinton, Obama should avoid negative opining about Sanders and condescension toward his supporters, who bring enthusiasm, idealism and commitment to the cause that serves all Democrats and is as precious as gold to any nominee, whoever he or she may ultimately be.

0001218,Markos Moulitsas: The real Obama’s America,"Poor
That’s why the real estate tycoon looks out his window and sees a dystopian hellhole. “Crippled America” screams the headline of his latest book, in which he promises to “make America great again.” His first ad in Iowa featured a black-and white montage of the shooters in San Bernardino, Calif., body bags, missiles being launched from ships, buildings being destroyed by bombs, people swarming across a border and an ominous voice warning against terrorists and immigrants who are out to kill us.
Trump is tickled when murderous fascists like Vladimir Putin fête him. He supports waterboarding even if it doesn’t work because “they deserve it.” He imagines hordes of African-Americans murdering white people. He thinks it’s funny to mock Hillary Clinton for going to the bathroom.
Trump had three young girls sing a campaign song at a rally with lyrics like “President Donald Trump knows how to make America great! Deal from strength or get crushed every time!” and “Enemies of freedom, face the music! C’mon boys! Take ’em down.” Utterly creepy. And if Trump is president, every store will say “Merry Christmas!” because apparently he plans to eliminate both the free exercise and free speech clauses of the First Amendment.
So, given that Trump’s America is a bombed-out husk of a dead civilization, it follows that it’s
What’s actually embarrassing is, well, Trump himself.
The Obama administration has delivered affordable healthcare to almost 18 million formerly uninsured Americans and has added 13.7 million new jobs in seven years, compared to a laughable 1.3 million during George W. Bush’s tenure.
Diplomacy has thawed relations with Cuba and Iran. When two American gunboats were confiscated after drifting into Iranian waters, diplomacy resolved the issue in a matter of hours, to the GOP’s chagrin. America can’t be under siege if we’re being civil to our enemies, can it? And there’s that little matter of halting Iran’s nuclear program.
We’ve seen al Qaeda decapitated and a marked decrease in terrorism-related deaths in the United States — 101 during Obama’s term, compared to 3,279 during Bush’s. And despite conservative hysteria, the number of Americans killed by terrorists overseas between 2001 and 2013 was only 350. Every death is problematic, of course, which is why it’s bizarre that Republicans don’t care about the 406,496 people killed by firearms in the United States during that same period.
Remember the Ebola panic? Republicans ripped into Obama for refusing to quarantine the entire nation and impose a travel ban. And then all of America died — didn’t it?
It’s now easier to afford college, we’ve begun the transition to a non-fossil-fuel economy, we’re taking global climate change more seriously (because if Florida underwater isn’t dystopian, what is?), there’s greater oversight of Wall Street (though it could be tougher) and we are a far more tolerant and equal society today. Racists and bigots might hate that, but they are now the fringe minority.
Is everything perfect in Obama’s America? Of course not, and liberals can be just as critical of the president as conservatives. The difference is, our criticism is based on reality, not a trumped-up ideological fantasy.

0001219,Dem PAC poll-tested attacks on Obama over father's Muslim heritage,"A Democratic super PAC poll tested several personal attacks against then-Sen.
The Jan. 9, 2008,
Begala, who now runs a super PAC backing Clinton's presidential bid, tweeted that the research was conducted on behalf of an “independent progressive” political action committee led by an Obama supporter. He said the group also ran polling on potential attack lines against Clinton.
The point of the polling, Begala said, was to determine the candidates’ potential weaknesses ahead of the general election.
The WikiLeaks emails indicate the super PAC also tested attack lines about Sen.
The poll questions about Obama, as written in the emails, included:
- Obama (owe-BAHM-uh)'s father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world's most populous Islamic country.""
- Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) is ranked as one of the ten most liberal members of the Senate because of his support of issues like gay adoption.""
- Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) described his former use of cocaine as using ""a little blow.""
Conservative opposition research groups passed around the email highlighting the Muslim question.
Tom Matzzie, the former Washington director for the liberal group MoveOn.org, said the poll was taken to see how voters responded to potential attacks against Clinton and Obama by Republicans.
Those on the email were ready to defend whoever won the Democratic nomination, Begala said, as he did once Obama defeated Clinton in the primaries.
Clinton’s campaign has hammered her GOP rival, Donald Trump, for promoting doubts that President Obama was born in the U.S. and rejected Trump’s assertion that she was responsible for fanning the racially charged rumor in 2008.
In a Friday conference call with reporters, the Clinton campaign lashed out at WikiLeaks, calling the Russian hack of Podesta’s emails an “unprecedented and alarming attack” on U.S. democracy meant to influence the election in favor of Trump.
Clinton’s team criticized Trump for his flattering comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin and ripped him for encouraging further cyberattacks that they say endanger the nation's sovereignty.

0001220,Trump: Don't Take Money From Domestic Programs To Bloat The Military,"Sponsor: The Hunger Site
Trump wants to make cuts to essential programs that help citizens in need and give it to the military instead.
Trump's campaign message was ""Make America great again,"" and most people thought he was referring to the country as a whole. But now that he's in office, it is becoming more obvious that was not his intention at all.
Instead of putting more money into essential domestic programs (Environmental Protection Agency, education, job training, National Institutes of Health, Meals on Wheels), Trump wants to increase the defense budget for the military by $52.3 billion at the expense of vital domestic programs.
In the America under this myopic budget, children at home will potentially have their educational programming taken away via PBS funding cuts, local communities could have toxic sites remain uncleaned thanks to the massive EPA cuts, and people will be much worse-off with significant cuts coming to the NIH which provide essential health-related research.
In 2015, 13.1 million children lived in food insecure households, while 13 percent of all American households were considered food insecure. Just imagine what almost $53 billion could do for hungry children and families.
The U.S. already spends obscene amounts of money on its defense program. In 2015, the country had a declared military and defense budget of $601 billion. Why should the military have more money when it could be spent on feeding U.S. citizens and giving our children a better education? If Trump truly wanted to ""Make America great again,"" he would know that requires reinvesting in America and its citizens!
Trump needs to stop dwelling on the past and thinking a higher-funded military will somehow be the answer to all of our domestic problems.
The U.S. cannot continue to spending money overseas when people are home are hungry and need better education. Sign to show your support for prioritizing domestic enrichment over war, poverty, and death!
Dear President Trump,
You said you wanted to ""make America great again,"" but your new budget plan is actually taking money away from domestic programs that people rely on and you are giving that money to the military instead.
Right now, our military is already spending more than the rest of the world by a massive margin. Is it really that important to keep pushing money into something that already has so much when people at home are suffering?",unknown,True
0001221,Disrespecting The National Anthem And The American Flag Are Not Legitimate Forms Of Political Protest,"This is going to backfire on the left in a major way. On Sunday, more than a hundred NFL players knelt during the playing of the national anthem. It was obviously an attempt to make some sort of public statement about President Trump, but it was an exceedingly poor way to go about doing that. Because our young people are not even taught about the importance of our national anthem and our national flag in school, most of these players didn’t even understand what they were doing. Our anthem is sung and our flag is proudly displayed prior to major sporting events for a reason. The truth is that our national anthem and our national flag are both symbols that directly represent our nation. In other words, when you show disrespect to the anthem or to the flag you are literally showing disrespect to the United States of America. So what these players did on Sunday was essentially to spit in the face of every single American citizen.
This is not just an American thing. All over the world it is well understood that respect for the national flag and other national symbols is not optional. What transpired at NFL games on Sunday will be broadcast all over the planet, and the rest of the world will be laughing at our national disgrace.
The very first NFL game scheduled on Sunday was held in London, and
The first game of the day between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars saw dozens of players from both teams kneel while almost the entire Jaguars’ on-field and sideline players and employees locked arms during the U.S. national anthem, including owner Shahid Khan. Some players stood while others knelt.
And of course similar “sideline protests” happened at other NFL stadiums all over the nation. Never before in American history have we ever seen
Demonstrations spread throughout the league as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity.
Several players from the Buffalo Bills, Denver Broncos, New York Giants, Detroit Lions, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons were among those who chose not to stand for the anthem. The Miami Dolphins, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles, Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, Los Angeles Chargers and Green Bay Packers stood with arms locked, though some players from those teams chose to kneel.
I honestly don’t think that the NFL will ever be the same after this. It had already been transformed into the “no fun league”, and now the focus will squarely be on political protests rather than football for the foreseeable future.
Needless to say, millions upon millions of Americans were completely disgusted by the disrespect shown to our national symbols on Sunday, and President Trump
“If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect …,” Trump said in tweets Saturday afternoon. “Our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!”
If professional football players want to speak out against President Trump, I have no problem with that whatsoever.
But for them to openly and brazenly disrespect our entire country is crossing a line that should never be crossed.
What in the world has happened to America? All over America high school football coaches are being banned from saying prayers before games, and yet disrespecting our anthem and our flag is somehow acceptable? The following comes from
Marc Short, the president’s legislative director, has also backed his boss, telling “Meet the Press” that a double standard for players who chose to voice their views on the field, and that the president was speaking for the majority of Americans on what sort of expression was appropriate. Short compared a crackdown on protests to the ban on high school football coaches leading players in prayer before games.
“There are high school coaches across America today who are punished for leading their players in prayer, and yet, when an N.F.L. player takes a knee, somehow that player is presumed to be a martyr for a social cause,” Mr. Short said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “The president is standing with the vast majority of Americans who believe that our flag should be respected.”
Many of these players are going to look back on what they have done with great shame. They may have believed that they were disrespecting President Trump, but the truth is that they were disrespecting this great land and every single American that has ever lived. They owe all of us an apology, and that should happen as soon as possible.
And the NFL may think that it is all powerful, but stunts like this are going to cost it millions upon millions of dollars. Already, ratings were way down
Player protests of the National Anthem – such as when quarterback Colin
If just a few players kneeling had that much of an impact on the ratings, what do you think is going to happen now?
Unfortunately, I have a feeling that this is just the beginning. In fact, one former Democratic member of Congress is calling on all NFL players
A former Democrat Congresswoman has called for every NFL player to kneel during the national anthem at Sunday’s games, while branding President
Donna Edwards, who retired as a US representative for Maryland earlier this year, issued the bold statement on Saturday, responding to Trump’s criticism of NFL players who refuse to stand for the anthem.
‘On Sunday, I hope every @NFL player takes a knee in solidarity w [Colin Kaepernick] against the white supremacist who squats in our White House,’ Edwards said in reference to the former San Francisco quarterback, who is now a free agent.
No matter what your political perspective is, it is wrong to disrespect our national anthem and it is wrong to disrespect our flag.

He also claimed that fresh probes were being undertaken against him and his NGO IRF despite past investigations having found no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing on their part.
Raising the recent renewal of IRF's foreign funding licence, followed by revoking of the renewal and suspension of four home ministry officers, Naik asked if this was because the renewal was ""against the laid down agenda of the government?"". ""Why would you suspend FCRA officials? Is it because they did things by the book?"" he asked.
The televangelist sought to question the ""selective leaking of government documents to the media"". ""The one and only investigation report submitted till now remains inconclusive, but the solicitor general's 'judgment' of banning IRF and I was duly leaked....Is this how IRF will be banned? By creating an atmosphere of ban? Rather than rely on proofs and evidences?"" he asked.
Also countering the allegations of forced conversions against him and the IRF, Naik dared the government to produce the converted person along with the statement about ""how he or she was forcibly converted"". ""Isn't this the most basic proof of forced conversion? The fact is, there never was forced conversion,"" he argued.
Stating that he had been preaching for 25 years, Naik said the move to act against him was part of a deeper agenda to attack
""If IRF and I are banned, it will be biggest jolt to the country's democracy...this ban will set a precedence of unspeakable injustices against the 20 crore Muslims of India. This action will embolden and encourage every fringe element in the country to do as they please. If you thought intolerance increased in the country recently, this action of the government will take it to an all-time high,"" he alleged.
Stating that he had tried to stay away from the spotlight trained on him following claims by two terrorists behind the July 1 attack in Dhaka that they were inspired by his speeches, Naik said he felt it best to continue with his work and not pay attention to his detractors. ""But I soon realised that this time it was different. there was much greater media involvement, and a much deeper government's involvement,"" he alleged.
In an appeal to Indians, Naik, who is currently abroad, pleaded: ""If you find any wrongdoing on my part, punish me by all means....I'm open to any investigation.""
""To all, my appeal is do not allow subversion of the Constitution. My appeal to the government - be fair in your investigation. Be fair in what you allege. Be truthful with facts,"" he added.
Naik claimed that even if India were to close the doors on him, it would work to his advantage as ""many countries would welcome this humble servant of God with red-carpet treatment"".

If the Clinton Foundation suffered a fraction of the problems of Trump’s, the media outrage would be deafening, yet not a single instance of quid pro quo has been unearthed.
Seven Republican investigations into the Benghazi, Libya, terror attacks found nothing. So, they became probes of her emails, hoping to find something, anything, to pin on her. Unfortunately for them, there was nothing incriminating, illegal, or untoward. Nothing.
So now, during an unrelated investigation into scumbag Anthony Weiner, the FBI may have found something of relevance, but who knows? We’ll just make a big announcement, so that everyone can assume the worst of Clinton, yet again, without a single fact to buttress the hysteria. And really, what could possibly be in those emails that would justify this witch-hunt atmosphere? Emails to al Qaeda giving them directions to our facility in Benghazi?
Of course, there’s zero interest in the truth. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said the FBI should only comment further on those new emails if anything of substance is found. Otherwise, clearing Clinton yet again would only be perceived as “rigging” the election. Very convenient. She’s guilty if she did it, guilty if she didn’t. But then again, how is that different than the GOP’s decades-long crusade against her?
And even if those emails prove to be innocuous and irrelevant, we can probably expect a new round of investigations into Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s use of different computers to access her emails. Because, you know, if you at first don’t succeed, try, try again.
Meanwhile, as FBI Director James Comey stokes the anti-Clinton cause with selective leaks, he refuses to comment on something of real substance: the apparent link between Russia and the Trump campaign. Or as Senate Minority Leader
Of course, this is all Sturm und Drang, as few if any minds are being changed. People are locked into their partisan preferences, and no new Trump tapes or Clinton emails will change any votes. The choices of our electorate are baked in.
But that won’t stop Republicans from continuing their witch hunt once Clinton is in office, no matter how lacking any evidence might be.

Our democracy would become a place where those with different views would be treated as enemies ruled by a bully who campaigns on a cult of negativity and has recently been called liar of the year by a nationally respected fact-checker.

All the while, Trump collected draft deferments on his way to becoming a bully who campaigns to be commander in chief by demeaning POWs as losers, because the man who never served prefers troops who were never captured.
In the America we love, young people are taught that Lady Liberty will always shine brightly in New York Harbor.

Throughout the nobler moments of our history, Americanism was embodied and defended by men and women from all backgrounds with all points of view who believed that in this land we love, America is a place where we are all in this together. That concept is alien to Trump’s politics, which makes Trump’s ambition alien to the spirit of America.
The Americans who defeated fascism in wartime did not consider their comrades in arms or the united nation behind them to be fat slobs, bimbos, rapists, murderers, idiots or morons, or disabled Americans worthy of being demeaned by a clown who is unfit to be a commander.

The Clinton campaign is attempting once again to sweep important questions under the rug about top aide Huma Abedin, her family ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Saudi Arabia, and her role in the ballooning Clinton email scandal.
The New York Post ran a

To debunk the evidence, Media Matters pointed to a
Senator McCain and others roundly criticized Rep.
In response to those critiques, Rep. Bachmann laid out the evidence in
The evidence, in my opinion, is overwhelming: Huma Abedin is nothing short of a Muslim Brotherhood princess, born into an illustrious family of Brotherhood leaders.
Her father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, was a professor in Saudi Arabia who founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs, an institution established by the Government of Saudi Arabia with the support of the Muslim World League.
The Muslim World League was “perhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world,” according to former federal prosecutor
That is not guilt by association but what federal prosecutors would call a “nexus” of like-minded people who shared the same goals.
A Saudi government document
Simply put, Huma Abedin worked for thirteen years as part of an enterprise whose explicit goal was to conquer the West in the name of Islam. No wonder the Clinton campaign wants to sweep this issue under the rug.
Mrs. Clinton has sometimes referred to Huma Abedin as her “second daughter.” Whether it was because of their close relationship or for some other reason, Mrs. Clinton has done much to further the Muslim Brotherhood agenda while Secretary of State, and can be counted on doing more as president.
As Secretary of State, she relentlessly pushed the overthrow of Libyan leader Mohammar Qaddafi, a dire enemy of the Brotherhood, even when President Obama and his Secretary of Defense were reluctant to go to war.
Along with Obama, she pushed for the overthrow of Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak and his replacement by Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammad Morsi.
She pushed for direct U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war, including the arming of Syrian rebels allied with al Qaeda.
As I reveal
Their first victim in the United States was a Coptic Christian named Nakoula Bassiley Nakoula, the maker of the YouTube video Hillary and Obama blamed for Benghazi.
New Abedin emails released to Judicial Watch this week show that Huma Abedin
When foreign donors had difficult in getting appointments with Mrs. Clinton through normal State Department channels, Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band would email Huma Abedin, and poof! the doors would open as if by magic.
The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization in 2014. But by then, the damage had been done.
Do Americans want eight years of a President Clinton, who will do even more to empower the Muslim Brotherhood and impose its agenda on America?

""My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values, it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as: justices on the Supreme Court that ignore the constitution, America’s continued vulnerability to Islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we’ve seen in the last 7 1/2 years.”
To the Mike Lee’s,
Have you forgotten why the Tea Party exploded onto the political scene in 2010, and why Donald Trump succeeded in roundly defeating 16 highly-qualified and highly-skilled Republican opponents in the primary?
A movement has sprung up in this country, and the political elites are terrified that it will succeed in pushing the eject button on their cozy Party of Big Government that has ruled, raped, and destroyed this country for too long.
Republican and Independent voters are undoubtedly smarter than the Mike Lee’s, Kelly Ayotte’s and the rest of them. These voters understand that the Movement will ultimately triumph, and that they will never go silent again until it does.
They will elect Donald Trump and
They know that an election victory by Hillary Clinton and
They know that a Hillary victory will mean America will continue to “lead from behind,” the “policy” Hillary touted as such a huge success in Libya, even as America’s enemies continue to attack us and get away with it unopposed.
What part of “defeat” do Mike Lee and Kelly Ayotte fail to understand?
I’m not talking a defeat of Donald Trump. I’m talking about the defeat of the America most of us still love and cherish.
To repeat: nobody ever thought that Donald Trump was a saint. That was never his qualification for office.
The reason Donald Trump is the only Republican qualified to become the next president is because he is the only one who understood early — and continues to articulate — the broad-based popular movement of Americans who are determined to stop the theft of our nation by the political and media elites.

And again, even though he’s not running for office, a win for Hillary puts Bill back in the White House, and back on the largest stage imaginable.
""Believe the victims,"" shouts the feminist-left, often from their Twitter accounts.
With so many on the left claiming that all sexual assault victims deserve to be believed, why then aren’t the numerous women who Bill Clinton allegedly sexually assaulted
Even though it seemed distasteful to many viewers for Trump to trot these alleged victims out as props for the debate, sitting them in the front row as heartbreaking reminders of the evil that men can do to women, at least it kept them in the discussion.
Much like Bill Cosby, if properly investigated and given the attention such claims deserve, a snowball effect might occur with more women coming forward. But maybe that’s exactly why these charges continue to be ignored.
The human brain is a pattern-making machine. After a predator selects a victim for the first time, whether what follows takes the form of an ill-intentioned seduction or full-on sexual assault, the predator’s brain learns one of two things from the result: If caught and punished, the brain learns a lesson. If there are no tangible consequences, the predator has no reason to reform.
Serial abusers of women will continue to act with impunity as long as they have no reason to think they’ll be punished.
Those women seated in the front row of that debate hall were a reminder that if guilty of their alleged crimes, Bill has not learned the right lesson. He would’ve never had to. And if you believe these accusers you would have to agree that for her part, Hillary has obviously never insisted that her husband be held accountable.
That, on its own, is enough to call her judgment and morals into question.

0001234,Sick Liberal Teacher Tweets Disgusting 4-Word Message For Las Vegas Shooting Victims,"After more than 50 have been reported dead and hundreds wounded, a liberal teacher and vehement anti-Trump activist took to Twitter to offer a solitary “prayer” for the Las Vegas shooting victims. However, once viewers read the 4 horrific words she wrote, they were sickened that a woman so depraved could be teaching their children.
When mass murders occur in the U.S., the liberals cross their fingers in the hope that the killer isn’t a devout Muslim terrorist. If the killer appears to be non-Muslim, the left immediately propagates that it must be a right-wing white nationalist. Disturbingly, their hope that they can blame peaceful conservatives is only outweighed by their cowardly support for such depraved mass murderers as one teacher openly pointed out.
According to
The
“Very disturbing that this woman is a teacher,” commented the Columbia Bugle. “Tragic that a woman as sick as her is teaching young minds.”
Still, the self-described teacher wasn’t the only liberal who hopes that Trump supporters and white people were slaughtered at the event, according to
Another
A user then replied, “dud slayed” and “kill, kill, kill, especially the white man,” along with a series of skulls and laughing emojis.
“I hope they killed more than 25 Trump supporters lol,” tweeted another.
When liberals weren’t expressing their support for the shooter, they were attempting to spin the attack for their own narrative. Piers Morgan tweeted, “If the shooter was Muslim, we’d call this a terrorist attack.” He then spread false news that the shooting was undoubtedly a terror attack by a “white American,” despite the fact that authorities have not yet come forward with any suspected motive and that Muslims can also be white Americans. Additionally, for an attack to be considered a terror attack, the attacker must have a political motivation, just like when Muslims commit acts of violence in support of Islamic Sharia law.
The truth of the matter is that suspect Stephen Craig Paddock used an illegal firearm in a

With that said, this Republican Party is failing themselves and failing Americans as a whole at resembling anything close to a major political party.
Let’s be honest for a minute. Republican support of Donald Trump is clearly less about Trump and more about former President Obama. It’s a guttural reaction. As hard as Republicans may have tried, they have been completely unable to erase our first black president from the history books.
It tears them up inside that a smart, cocky, black man beat them at their own game, twice. He stopped the world economy from crashing. He eased our fears during national tragedies, and whether we liked everything about the ACA or not, he tried his best to give more people access to health care. All with a smile. Not because he was happy with the way it all played out, but because that’s what presidents are supposed to do ― act presidential.
As president, Obama recognized that he represented all Americans, even the ones who didn’t vote for him. He recognized that he was not bigger than the office of the presidency. He knew that he owed the office a high level of respect. More importantly, though, he realized that our children were watching. A concept unfathomable to the current occupant of the Oval Office.
President Obama recognized that generations of politicians, teachers, civic leaders, and yes, children, would take their cues from how he behaved as president. Instead of engaging in Twitter battles or attacking the character of his detractors, he gracefully ignored their criticism and stood tall against a party determined to beat HIM. He acted presidential, imagine that.
My Republican friends should take note because what they’re supporting, either directly or indirectly, isn’t just an anti-Obama presidency but an anti-American president. Supporting a president who is uninterested, unprepared, and unwilling to learn from his mistakes isn’t just overtly political, it’s immoral. At some point, you are the company you keep.
(Let me unapologetically digress and say that if Republicans are offended that they’re constantly being called racist by Democrats, stop palling around with racists; it’s not that complicated. If you consistently find yourself on the side of the racist, if you consistently find yourself defending racists, if you consistently find yourself making excuses for racists, you may not be a racist, but you certainly look like one. If that hurts your feelings, that’s too bad, this is me abandoning political correctness. That’s what you wanted, right?)
There is no tax break in the world that can justify supporting a man who continues to lie to the American people with no hesitation. There’s no level that unemployment can fall to that should justify the disrespect that this man has shown to each and every one of us. The end will never justify the means, ever.
Instead of being honest with themselves and with the American people, Republicans have chosen to be complicit and engage in a level of intellectual dishonesty, and that isn’t just disgusting, it’s dangerous.
Deep down we all know that there is nothing about Donald Trump that is admirable. There is nothing about Donald Trump that is redeemable. He is a con-artist and a fraud. He worships at the altar of greed, lies like it’s going out of style, and sees apologizing as a sign of weakness. He is everything our parents told us not to embrace.
At some point though, the bottom will fall out of this president’s poll numbers, taking the rest of the Republican Party with him. Not even this brand of corporate cowards can save this administration. It will be at that point and only at that point that Republicans will admit publicly what many have said to me privately, “He had no business becoming president.” A fact that has been obvious from the moment he emerged from his golden tower. A fact that privately, few Republicans deny. When that happens, let me be the first to say that there is nothing courageous about publicly coming to that conclusion.
There is a clear difference between political courage and political expediency. The first is how Republicans should have acted during the election and the second is how they actually acted. Like a mathematician, Republicans made a calculation that party was more important than country. They decided that attempting to erase our first black president from the history books was more important than any other pressing issue.
The more I engage with Republicans post-election, the more I realize how badly they are still reeling from their loss to President Obama in 2008. The more I realize that they are stuck in a time warp reminiscent of a 1980s movie with no path or plan to move America forward. The problem with that realization is that we’re not in a movie, this is real life and these decisions have consequences.
If Republicans can’t figure out a way to lead, it’s time for Americans to replace them with someone who can. Someone who can restore faith in government and civility into our national dialogue. Someone respectable. Someone other than the current group of politicians who can’t get over 2008.",unknown,True

Key to the strategy is a political “black operations” specialist named Scott Foval, the National Field Director for a left-wing activist group called Americans United for Change.

Foval goes on to
“The campaigns and DNC cannot coordinate with Priorities, but I guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the Super PACs all talk to each other, and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.”
Congressional committees should be calling on the FBI to investigate what appears to prima facie evidence criminal collusion between the Clinton campaign, the Clinton Super PAC, and the political dirty tricks operations run by Foval and chief strategist, Robert Creamer.
Creamer is the husband of Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill) and founded Democracy Partners in 2011, a group that brings together different left-wing organizations and coordinates their actions to meet Clinton campaign goals.
“Wherever Trump and Pence are gonna be we have events,” Creamer explains to the undercover reporter. “We have a call with the [Clinton] campaign every day to go over the focuses that need to be undertaken.”
Already, the DNC appears to have gone into panic mode. Foval has been fired by Americans United for Change, the activist group.

The media heads were drooping. Boring! Because they don’t want this election to be about policy, where the tired left-wing dogmas Hillary is spouting have been tried and failed repeatedly for generations.
They were just waiting for Trump to say it. They would know what “it” is when they heard it.
Hillary looked down repeatedly. A script? She seemed to have attack lines her staff had prepared. When Trump wouldn’t take the bait, she tried another. The media held its breath. Will he bite this time? Will he go off the rails?
Because that is the narrative. It’s all about Trump’s character, his “unfitness” for office. That is the narrative Hillary and her campaign gurus in the media have decided to push, because they don’t have anything better.
Finally, Chris Wallace — who ought to be shot for keeping the candidates on substantive topics — asks Trump if he will accept the result of the election. And Trump won’t say the words.
Now the phony journalists wake up. There it is, like the response in catechism class (okay, none of them has gone to catechism class). And he won’t say it. He won’t say that he will accept the results of a phony, rigged election.
Suddenly, they have their “gotcha” moment.
Never-Trumper Ben Shapiro was tweeting, and he caught it immediately:

And then something horrifying happened.
No, it wasn’t Hillary’s phony horror that somehow Donald Trump would set off a remake of Bush v. Gore in an evenly divided Supreme Court come November. Nor was it visions of street fighting and riots.
Donald Trump started calling them out. He told the truth about our rigged elections.
“First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing,” he said. “It’s so dishonest. And they’ve poisoned the mind of the voters.”
And then he used the live cameras, and in front of tens of millions of Americans, he delivered the news — the real news that the media has refused to cover during the campaign.
He told America about our rotten election system, the millions of dead voters who have been put back on the voter rolls. Why? So the Democrats can
He told Americans about the “millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn’t be registered to vote.” Oh yes, Virginia.

The ease with which ineligible voters can cast ballots in America, robbing legitimate voters of their voice, make elections in many Third World countries look good. And that’s a disgrace.

And that is truly horrifying to them.

0001240,Duty-bound: Donor explains why Trump deserves support over Clinton,"This has been a particularly vicious election season, with
Hillary says Mr. Trump is destroying our country and a racist anti-Semite. On the contrary, Mr. Trump is making our country stronger by continuing to stand for the values and ideals that we have always held sacrosanct.
Well, I can tell you as a Jewish Republican that this is simply not true. Those attacking Mr. Trump — like Hillary — just don’t have the same values as myself and Mr. Trump: values such as free speech, protecting our country from disruptive forces and allying strongly with Israel — the sole democracy in the Middle East.
But Hillary clearly looks down on democracy; if elected, she would ensure we never have a fair election in this country again. Just like her husband, Hillary has a deplorable track record.
If Hillary were to become president, you could say goodbye to free speech. She harangues Mr. Trump for speaking his mind and for being genuine. But that is why we need him. We need someone to lead our country who is unafraid to speak his mind, calling out the faux leadership we’ve seen in the past eight years.
Hillary has shown that she stands against the Bill of Rights, a document representing everything our country stands for. Hillary says she’s for free speech, but this is a clear lie. She does everything in her power to quiet those who disagree with her.
She calls Mr. Trump a racist despite the fact that she supports the racist Black Lives Matter movement. She is a disciple of Marxist Saul Alinsky and anti-American George Soros, two men committed to destroying our country to turn it into a Communist Utopia.
Incapable of maintaining free speech, she somehow also fails in one of the few arenas in which free speech is not protected. Her wanton abuse of government protocol proves that she is not qualified for the security clearances that come with being secretary of state — let alone president.
Hillary has stood behind the United Nations — an entity known to be anti-United States and anti-Israel — as it has espoused dangerous rhetoric. She supported the Organization of the Islamic Conference’s resolution to weed out discrimination and hate speech against Muslims, yet has done nothing to combat the growing anti-Semitism in our country and the world.
Mr. Trump is the only person willing to call things what they are and to stand up to “politically correct” bullies like the U.N., who are slowly dismantling the United States and Israel.
Hillary refuses to show any political friendship to Israel, refusing to accept Israel’s right to control Jerusalem during her tenure in the State Department.
Mr. Trump is the first major candidate to offer real immigration reform. He is the only candidate who will protect Christians from the worldwide persecution they face and root out the anti-Semitism that has been choking the globe. Mr. Trump will restore credibility to U.S. foreign policy as a strong commander-in-chief.
Hillary can’t do this. She has already shown that she is beholding to political Islam entities.
Not only does she want to open our borders to everyone, but she wants our country to mirror the Islamist countries she so ardently supports. Hillary supported a deal that provided $150 billion to Iran — a material support of terrorism. This isn’t just immoral — it’s illegal.
Her support of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Libya and Syria supports the war on women. Hillary says Mr. Trump disrespects women; her political allies abuse, torture, jail and oppress women.
Her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya resulted in the deaths of four Americans. Due to her refusal to reinforce protection or send in military forces to protect the U.S. ambassador to Libya and consulate employees, Hillary is directly responsible for these deaths.
Does she believe in the Islamist regime of terror? She believes in her bank account. She has sold favors to our enemies in exchange for Clinton Foundation funding. In return, she allows them carte blanche to invade other countries and continue to fund terrorism worldwide.
And her vice presidential pick is no better, showing that when she succumbs to her health issues, he will maintain her status quo of criminality.
The future of Western Civilization is at grave risk if a non-believer like Hillary wins. It is our duty as, not just Jews and Republicans, but as Americans to ensure Mr. Trump is elected to keep our country and way of life safe.

The latest revelation — that the town hall moderator overseeing a Democratic primary debate gave CNN contributor Donna Brazile a peek at expected questions, and Brazile then fed Hillary Clinton's campaign staff a question expected to come up in the primary debate against
Bernie Sanders supporters should be outraged: We've seen time and again how the DNC was never going to allow their guy a fair shot at the nomination.
Debbie Wasserman-Schultz had to resign from her post at the DNC after emails revealed she was favoring Clinton and working against Sanders. Now we know that, at the same time, Brazile at CNN was proving her Clinton loyalist bona fides by abusing the system and rigging the game to bolster Clinton over Sanders.
The DNC must have been laughing themselves silly over the fast one they were pulling to elevate Brazile, who was putatively objective when it came to Democratic primary contenders, to dispose of Wasserman-Schultz’s double dealing. Instead we now learn what insiders already knew: that Brazile was a corrupt Clinton partisan herself. Meanwhile, Wasserman-Schultz went to … Clinton campaign staff.

Oh the small incestuous little world of Washington.
Americans now have reason to wonder about the other debates and who else in the so-called unbiased media world was seeking to assist the Clinton campaign by sneaking her a preview of questions or tilting the news in her favor. Such thinking is no longer cynical; it's just realistic as we've seen just how widespread the corruption and bias goes.
And if people are willing to cheat in the debates, what else wouldn’t they justify cheating on to accomplish their ends?
MORE STORIES FROM THE HILL:
It is precisely the repeated revelations of cheating at debates, inciting violence at rallies, and collusion between the DNC and their dirty tricksters, that lead many Americans to believe — not unreasonably — that, given just a whiff of deniability, these same people would unhesitatingly attempt to rig the election.
Count on Hillary Clinton to respond as she always does: Deny any knowledge of the wrong doing, (because you see, you can’t actually prove that she actually saw fill-in-the-blank), blame someone else, (the Russians have become the Democrat’s iteration of “the dog ate my homework”), and distract the American people with the idea that there is a vast conspiracy out to get her (projection, anyone?)
When first caught, Brazile followed the same playbook, deflecting from the veracity of the emails and distracting with claims of persecution.
She wanted voters to think it's nothing but a dirty political trick to expose the ugly truth of such back-dealing, but in a different era this was called whistle-blowing and celebrated.
There is a whole cohort of politically powerful or connected people in Clinton’s orbit who apparently think rules and boundaries are for other people, not for them. Wikileaks, among others, is hoisting them on their own petard.
The American people have quite had it with this privileged, hypocritical crew. In one week, to paraphrase Michael Moore, watch many of them lob in a legal molatov cocktail called Donald J. Trump to blow up entire stinking the swamp.

But while a presidential pardon might avoid the sorry spectacle of a national security investigation by the FBI of an incoming president for her reckless mishandling of classified information while secretary of State, it would in no way deter Republicans in Congress from conducting their own investigations of Mrs. Clinton, up to and including impeachment proceedings.
For example, we now know that
Imagine for a moment how Congress would react if Obama were to pardon Mrs. Clinton not just for her email woes but for her past corruption, even for corruption not yet discovered? Do you really think Republicans, even if they were in the minority, would let that one go?

Here are just a few of the Hillary scandals Congress could pursue:
• The Loretta Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac of the Phoenix airport, just as the FBI was getting ready to make public its conclusions on the Hillary Clinton private email server. Did Bill Clinton promise Lynch that Hillary, if elected president, would reappoint her as Attorney General?
• Pay for play at the Clinton Foundation. I can imagine several committee chairmen exploring
Will they all go to the mat (or jail) to protect Mrs. Clinton and her scandal-plagued presidency?
Pay-to-play schemes that violated RICO could lead to multiple federal prosecutions to disgorge illicit profits through civil forfeiture proceedings. Imagine the Clinton Foundation having to repay the Governments of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Algeria and Qatar tens of millions of dollars for having essentially traded payoffs for U.S. government favors or for the promise of favors to come?
What about the Varkey Foundation and its GEMS education initiative, which paid Bill Clinton more than $56 million to serve as front man for a gigantic fund-raising scheme? “Upon funding and implementation, these commitments will have a total value of over $70 billion,” the
Are they waiting for Mrs. Clinton to be sworn into office before those “commitments” can be banked? Are donors expecting future favors from a Clinton administration in return for their money? I can’t imagine Congress not wanting to know answers to those questions.
Or what about contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative
• Illegal coordination between Hillary’s presidential campaign, her super Pac, and the Democratic National Committee. Allegations of illegal collusion stemmed from undercover video shot by Project Veritas that captured DNC self-styled “undercover” operatives boasting of
• The Iran nuclear deal. Congress will surely want to investigate Mrs. Clinton’s role in establishing a secret back-channel with Iran that led to the worst diplomatic deal in U.S. history, a deal that rewarded a terrorist and terror-sponsor regime with $150 billion and a sure path to nuclear weapons.
Did Mrs. Clinton meet with Iranian officials or regime intermediaries before official talks began? Did she make promises to Clinton Foundation donors that she would “open up” Iran for U.S. business once she became president?
Oh, the scandals will be rich, and they will be unending. And they are all of the Clintons’ making. They will not only further weaken our hand in foreign relations, but will distract us from what needs to be done domestically to make this country great again.

0001246,Should President Trump be able to pull NBC News’ license?,"As seen in the tweet below, President Trump has suggested he will be looking into the licensing of NBC News for what he calls their “fake news” reports. He is specifically talking about NBC News’ report on a meeting this past summer where it is reported that President Trump asked the military for a tenfold increase to our nuclear weapons arsenal.
With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)
This is far from the first time the president has taken issue with the media. He frequently calls reports that paint him in a negative light “fake news.” But with his tweet this morning, he has upped the ante with his war with the media. The accuracy of the story is not what this debate is about. It is about whether President Trump should be able to pull NBC News’ license.
Those who think he should be able to pull NBC News’ license point to the fact that many news outlets have often distorted what the president has said or done. They see these news outlets, like NBC News, as supporting a political agenda against the president and that their false reporting is hurting the country. They feel that the president is an honest man and these media reports are made to make him appear dishonest. They point out that the reports are filled with anonymous sources and so, they can’t be true, but made up to discredit the president.
To the people who do not think he should be able to pull their license, this is a First Amendment issue. Freedom of the press and free speech can’t be suppressed by the government. If the president were allowed to do that, then we would be well on our way to living in a fascist country. The president shutting down media outlets he does not like is how we end up with government-controlled media.
With the president’s tweet this morning, he again brings attention back to his war with the media. He has been using the term “fake news” for some time now. Many of the president’s supporters see the media as pushing a far left agenda and bent on destroying the president. Others see the media as the last line of defense against what they see as an administration more and more out of control.
Here is a Washington Post video of President Trump talking about the NBC News story on our nuclear arsenal:
Should the president be able to pull the license of NBC News? Has NBC News been pushing a false, left-wing agenda bent on destroying the president? Or, is the president dangerously close to attempting to destroy the First Amendment?
Those who support the president feel NBC News and other media outlets are pushing a false narrative that is hurting the country. For the safety of the nation, they must be stopped from doing any more damage.

0001247,"Stephen Paddock Had Explosives, Bomb-Making Materials; Attn, Gun Control Idiots","Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock had a lot of explosive material and the ability to build bombs, which he was apparently planning to do. This is important evidence that gun control doesn’t work and wouldn’t have with him because, as many of my Twitter followers pointed out, those who are faced with strict gun control usually resort to bombs and running people over with vehicles. It’s also more proof that Paddock took his cue from Islamic terrorists.
Yesterday’s
Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said they also found Tannerite, an explosive that detonates when shot by bullets. . . .
That was in Paddock’s Mandalay Bay hotel room. But there’s more:
In Paddock’s car, authorities found more ammunition and ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used to make explosives, Mr. Lombardo said.
Ammonium nitrate is easily obtained. You can buy it on the net from purveyors like Alibaba. These kinds of explosive materials are hallmarks of Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other Islamic terrorist groups who provide shopping lists and how-to videos on how to build bomb devices. They are not the hallmarks of someone who is “just crazy.” Or someone who has heavy gambling debts (and we’ve yet to see any evidence that Paddock had any gambling debts, just info that he was a high-stakes gambler, which is not the same as losing and owing).
So, what was Paddock planning to bomb? Or was he keeping that stuff in his car in case his plan with hotel windows and the automatic guns didn’t work? That appears likely. If he was refused entry into the hotel or not allowed to take his guns and ammo in–had they been detected (which they weren’t), he could’ve set off bombs in the venue.
And, again, this is a memo to the two Jidiot Jimmys–Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon–and all of the other gun-grabbing, statist, gun control freaks: when guns are taken away from criminals and terrorists, they a) go to the black market where they easily obtain them; or b) turn to other methods of mass murder that can arguably be more dangerous and more effective, including bombs and other explosive devices to blow people up and vehicles to mow people down.

0001251,WHEN A SOCIALIST PUT RAND PAUL IN THE HOSPITAL,"Sen. Rand Paul has returned to work on Capitol Hill after a Trump-hating, Bernie Sanders-supporting, left-wing Democrat put him in the hospital after what looks like a politically motivated attack.
The junior Republican senator from Kentucky returned to Washington Monday in time for the Senate Finance Committee to begin considering the Senate tax reform bill, which is now said to include a provision repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate, as Paul has long proposed.
The afternoon of Friday, Nov. 3, Rene Albert Boucher, 59, ambushed 54-year-old Paul, his next-door neighbor of 17 years, at his home, crushing Paul’s ribs while the senator was performing yard work. A registered Democrat, Boucher has practiced as an anesthesiologist in Bowling Green. Paul is an ophthalmologist. Boucher has entered a not guilty plea to a misdemeanor fourth-degree assault charge.
“From my perspective, I’m not really too concerned about what someone’s motive is,” Paul said.
“I’m just concerned that I was attacked from the back and somebody broke six of my ribs and gave me a damaged lung where at least for now I have trouble speaking and breathing and now I’ve hurt for 10 days.”
There was “no justification” for the attack, Paul told the Washington Examiner this week.
Senior Paul adviser Doug Stafford said separately that Paul and Boucher hadn’t spoken for years before the incident. “This was not a ‘fight,’ it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person,” Stafford said in a statement. “Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention.”
This is Paul’s second reported brush with political violence this year.
Paul was playing in the congressional baseball practice game in a Washington suburb in June when Trump-hating Bernie Sanders supporter James T. Hodgkinson opened fire wounding four and coming close to assassinating House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) who survived his life-threatening injuries. Hodgkinson was killed by a police officer on the scene.
“Politically, Boucher was a socialist, according to his realtor friend Jim Bullington, 74, who served three terms on the city commission and was also one of Paul’s eye patients,” the Daily Mail reports. Boucher would come to a restaurant in Bowling Green “where he would drink wine and espouse the virtues of ripping up the American healthcare system and replacing it with a publicly-funded service like those in Canada and Great Britain.”",unknown,True
0001252,"Spitting on veterans, taking the knee","In the 1960s, overtly communist agitators came up with an effective strategy for dividing Americans: they attacked veterans returning from the Vietnam War. They mercilessly targeted men who had the least power in society: those who lacked the resources to avoid the draft through political connections or college enrollment. Following Saul Alinsky’s hateful playbook, they targeted, isolated, and demonized young men coming home who had just been through the hell of war.
The strategy paid off in great whopping dividends of social division and discord. It also did nothing to convince ordinary Americans or elected officials of the need to stop the war: instead, it weakened the rest of the anti-war movement.
But here is the important part, the part nobody remembers now: ending the war didn’t matter to the communist agitators who screamed at legless 21-year olds returning from Saigon. It didn’t matter because those agitators were not anti-war: they were pro-communist warmongers rooting for communist victory abroad and at home.
This important history is now willfully denied. Mere mocking is enough to shut down discussion of it in the worlds of education, the media, and politics. Even conservative pundits and politicians dumbly grandstand against “McCarthyism,” as if there never was a real and powerful communist movement in America, let alone one now.
Mocking the idea that communist agitation in America was and is real has become even more fashionable of late, just as communist Antifa thugs and their useful idiots in academia riot on the streets and shut down free speech on college campuses – and Google campuses, and everywhere else suppression of thought is deemed a special priority of the human resources battalion.

Like the soldiers coming home from Vietnam, it is the courageous men (and women) serving in uniform who are the overt targets of the agitator’s bullets and rage, but all Americans of all races are trapped in the agitators’ cultural crosshairs.
“Taking a knee” is just the latest iteration of “Occupy Wall Street” or “Black Lives Matter” or any of the other countless stupidity parades disrupting college campuses. Countless more useful idiots join in by virtue-signaling their support for professional agitators whose real goals have nothing to do with “peace” or “equality” or “bullying” or understanding the historical pain of minorities or, as so many columnists are bleating now, “free speech.”
If we had honest academicians in the universities teaching the real history of domestic communist agitation, maybe we wouldn’t be so universally gormless in the face of this now.

0001254,Sighting Down On The Second Amendment,"Before a people are enslaved, before any nation is taken over, they are first disarmed. That’s just history and common sense. From the inside or out, a nation is always first compromised by the removal of its ability to defend itself. Stalin, Hitler, Mao, et al., they all declawed whatever organism that stood in their way - most especially the people they intended to govern.
When Japan was planning to attack our mainland, their Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto purportedly said that attacking America would be like attacking a sleeping giant - and it is commonly claimed that he warned there would be a gun waiting for them ‘behind every blade of grass’ - indeed, a very reasonable statement. I find it fascinating that online liberal ‘fact checking’ sites adamantly insist that the quote is “bogus”. Further, they go on to say that gun rights activists often haul up that quote in order to drive home an argument for gun ownership - as though simply expressing that concept in such a context were evil.
The argument for unfettered gun ownership comes naturally, supports itself, and is entirely righteous.
Every year in this nation, medical malpractice takes more lives than do guns. It is estimated that between 800,000 to 2,000,000 deaths are prevented annually by guns - both in the hands of law enforcement as well as individual gun owners. Guns, in and of themselves, pose no threat to anyone but are regularly vilified by professional politicians who won’t themselves give up their own guns or the guns of their hired protection.
The Second Amendment of the Constitution guaranteeing every American citizen’s right to arm himself with firepower was considered to be the second most important right by the framers - preceded only by our right to express the opinions we hold as sacred and defendable. It is not surprising that both those amendments are the most hated by the liberal left and its partnering spokespeople the liberal media.
The Second Amendment was not adopted to ensure our ability to hunt for food. Nor did it have anything to do with sportsmanship or target practice. Gun ownership is entirely about self defense. And, in the case of the intent of the framers who had just escaped the tyranny of England’s monarchy, the Second Amendment was absolutely provided for the people to be able to defend themselves against tyrannical and runaway government. And this is why the potentially tyrannical and runaway, professional political leaders of today jump at any chance to take guns away from law-abiding Americans.
Only hours after the recent bloodbath in Las Vegas, liberal left politicians were instant to make gun control statements, before even offering any sympathy to the bereft surviving friends and family members of the victims of that crowd. The bodies of the dead from that massacre had not even been entirely identified and next of kin notified, before the liberal left politicians vaingloriously marched down the steps of our Capitol building in DC and declared yet another war against gun ownership.
It is remarkably noteworthy that, almost without exception, the mass-murdering shooters of the late 20th and 21st century here in America have been leftist politically or left-leaning Islamist terrorists. The nut-jobs of cultic liberalism or progressive socialist ideology do all the murdering. And then their political leaders vilify and strain to penalize and put additional controls on the conservative and often Christian gun owners who do no violence to anyone.
Indeed, the ancient bumper sticker that was so popular back in the late 60s early 70s - “WHEN GUNS ARE OUTLAWED, ONLY OUTLAWS WILL HAVE GUNS” - has never been anything less than 100% true. Whether the outlaw is coming through your backdoor as a burglar/rapist/murderer, or the outlaw is coming through your front door as a 21st century storm trooper in the employ of a government that has just declared itself to be your overseer and landlord, a gun can serve as the only voice of protest either might hear. And both of those culprits are absolutely aware of that.
The liberal media and liberal left are currently up on their haunches, fighting tooth and nail to push back the unforgivable insubordination of the majority of Americans who are being reintroduced to the power afforded them through our Constitution. The framers, I don’t believe, ever envisioned the extent of liberty that scrap of parchment would provide for the recovering remnant of righteousness in days as evil as these. And President Donald Trump is the target of unbelievable contempt from the left that thought the end of Constitutional America was finally in sight.
Few seem to recall how our last chief executive, America’s first and worst black president, had declared our Constitution to be an outdated drag that had served its purpose. And he once joked that the people who had written our Constitution obviously hadn’t planned on cooperating with the changes he had in mind for our nation. All the while he and his wife were, in eight years of hate-filled speeches, bolting together a race-hate Frankenstein that is only now beginning to walk. They were words that oozed easily from that devil’s brood of smooth-tongued snakes who knew they were talking to a fragmented and distracted audience.
Continued below...
Our sleepy preoccupation had allowed all sorts of scandal and treachery - from Benghazi, to ‘e-mailgate’, to the Iran nuke deal including pallets of cash shipped secretly to the turbaned friends of that regime. And the cancer of that administration, along with the monstrous enabling liberal media/entertainment industry, thought they finally had a stranglehold on the America they were sure they controlled. Hillary started drinking her victory champagne way too early on that election eve flight to NYC. But that night it was only God’s grace that gave us another four years to keep those wolves and cobras at bay.
As I have said so many times before, if the liberal slime (who are now feverishly romancing the na√Øve youth of our nation) ever again fully get their hooks and fangs into our governmental infrastructure, America as we have known it will be only a fond memory. But, in the meantime, it is obvious that the leftists are wanting no guns waiting for them when they finally undo the mistake they made in allowing a President Donald Trump to interrupt their takeover.
Protecting ourselves is not a conservative fantasy. It is a God-given mandate. The gift of being able to - WITH THE PULL OF THE TRIGGER - stop bloodthirsty wickedness from ravaging the precious pearls of our faith, love and sweaty labor, can certainly be part of the assignment God gave us as stewards of the liberty we have in Christ. (Luke 22:36, Psalm 82:4, Psalm 144:1, Matt. 7:6, etc.) It is our vulnerable liberty that, like a shining light, allows us to care for our children and openly be the example that God has called us to be.
The devil’s battle to take away the bullet, the only ballot that our own corrupt government or an invading one cannot ignore, is truly the last ground in a fight the corrupt political forces in this nation know they must capture. And, as they have shown us to date, the likes of a George Soros, Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton - our adversaries who are making the world safe for themselves - don’t play by the rules when the rules don’t work in their favor.
In a free society, the only control gained from ‘Gun Control’ will be the terminal upperhand given to the elite few who want selfishly to control us all. NOW is the unreturning time to rally in support of our President who wants to preserve our Constitution. And with our every opportunity and vote, let us work to preserve our right to defend ourselves. The Second Amendment is worthy of our defense. It is there to defend us. Don’t ever lose sight of that.",unknown,True
0001255,Shame on Cut-And-Run Conservatives—Stand With Judge Roy,"Rising accusations of sexual assault, abuse, and child molestation are (thankfully) bringing creepy Hollywood to its knees. We should rejoice, since these stories have been documented and released to the public at great length. But do we automatically stand by our men or our team when someone issues allegations against people whom we have trusted or look up to? Ben Shapiro has warned conservatives about partisan responses to allegations of sexual abuse. I agree.
Judge Roy Moore has been rocked, targeted with serious allegations of sexual abuse, including with minors. Are these accusations true? Will they sink his campaign? Sexual misconduct is wrong, whether the criminal is a Democrat or a Republican, and anyone who commits such terrible acts should not be in public office. When former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was exposed as a child molester who was bribing his victims with hush money, I joined with Republicans around the country denouncing him.
But we need to investigate accusations, not rush to conclusions.
With clear standards on these matters established, let’s also acknowledge that the corrupt media has a deliberate penchant for going after Republicans over even the hint of impropriety. The mainstream media equated Todd Akin and his “legitimate rape” comment with Anthony Weiner’s sexting. Akin is not in jail, while Weiner just reported to prison for sexting a minor. By the way, it had taken three weeks of repeated pressure from Andrew Breitbart before former Congressman Weiner admitted to his social media perversion. Contrast that media slow-walk with a New York Republican when he was caught sexting. He was immediately chastised by the press and forced to step down.
There is a double-standard in the media when it comes to these allegations. The press will “report first, question later” with Republicans. With Democrats, they question repeatedly and try to stave off any coverage when the Democrat is indeed guilty. The liberal media is a Republican Reputation Shredding machine, searching and destroying conservatives any way possible. Sadly, Republicans are still cutting and running, this time because of a WaPo hit piece.

0001256,"Employee stole $1.2 million of fajitas, prosecutor says","BROWNSVILLE, Texas -
A former juvenile justice department employee stole $1.2 million worth of fajitas over nine years, the district attorney said.
Gilberto Escaramilla would intercept orders and sell them to his own customers, Cameron County District Attorney Luis Saenz said.
“He would literally, on the day he ordered them, deliver them to customers he had already lined up,”
When Escaramilla missed a day of work for a medical appointment in August, a delivery driver showed up with 800 pounds of fajitas and another employee was baffled by the order - the juvenile department did not serve the sizzling entree.
Escaramilla was fired Aug. 8 and arrested at his house the following day, where investigators found fajita ingredients in his refrigerator.
Officials continued their investigation and arrested him last week on the more serious felony theft charge.

At first, I assumed the liberal elites were simply driven by their inability to accept that the American people elected Donald Trump as their 45th president.

0001267,K-12: The Schools You Deserve,"Thomas Jefferson declared: “The government you elect is the government you deserve.” Wouldn’t the same go for a school system? If you select it, you must deserve it.
Plato said an early version of what would later be attributed to Edmund Burke: “The penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.” Albert Einstein put it this way: “The world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it.”
In education, we have a startling amount of tolerating and encouraging.
What part is our responsibility? If we allow left-wing social engineers to take over our country and dumb down our children, maybe we are substantially to blame. It might not be accurate to say we select these people. But we do put up with them. A third party observing us might well conclude we prefer it this way.
Jefferson’s quote seem to suggest a cosmic morality or karmic reality that will inevitably reward or punish us. I think with the education people, the logic is a lot sloppier. They’re like a second cousin, not a very attractive person, and he shows up at your door and asks if he can stay the night. His car is broken down. A month later he is still there. You didn’t do anything to deserve this. But you did accept him in your house for a day. You never made him leave. That’s what education officials have somehow achieved. We’re supposed to believe their ruinous presence is normal, is good for us, and good for children. All of which is dubious. These education commissars are arguably a costly drag on the country.
Maybe he’s not even a real cousin, merely abusing the claimed relationship. Maybe it’s like Six Degrees of Separation where a stranger tangles you up in lies. Remember that movie? Here’s the story: “An affluent New York couple find their lives touched, intruded upon, and compelled by a mysterious young black man who is never quite who he says he is.” That would be actor Will Smith.
In short, he is a lot like the entire Education Establishment and its behavior toward this country for the last hundred years. Claiming to know all about education. No, they apparently don’t. Claiming to be concerned about your children. No, not much at all. Claiming to care about this great country. Yes, they care about transforming it fundamentally, just as Obama promised to do.
We are never sure what Will Smith is up to. But we suspect he is hanging around to take advantage of us. If we don’t ask him to leave, then it’s our fault.
All that’s required for evil men to succeed is that good men do nothing. This seems to be the essence of our problem. Not enough people did something. Not enough people said, I’m mad as hell and I’m not taking it anymore. The rough figure is that the US has 50 million functional illiterates. Maybe if all the young people were completely illiterate, the older people might start to get angry.
What actually would it take?
Yes, that is the vital question: what would awaken the American people? As it is now, we drift along in a slumber. The media are silent. The Ivy League universities are silent. The foundations are silent. The frog in the not-quite-boiling water is silent.
When we stand back and observe our Education Establishment, we are dumbfounded by their audacity. Imagine that John Dewey and colleagues would think of taking over the ed schools in order to take over the country. That they would render children unable to read (this is my conclusion) as a passport to a socialist paradise. They are indeed saucy baggage. They deserve a big dose of contempt.
There can be few more useless human beings than those who prattle on about educational advancement while the children are mugged into silence. Almost as bad are the good citizens who allow them to prattle on.
So much of what we call educational theory is nothing but marketing. They make up some new mumbo-jumbo such as New Math; and they say this is the ultimate method, just what your kids need. Everything the education professors come up with is presented to the public in this amazing end-of-history language. Finally, they claim, true education is at last triumphant. That’s how we got Sight-words, Reform Math, Constructivism, and much more.
Five years later all the kids are a little dumber. But the parents are somehow kept in line. Which brings us back to the punchline. If good people do nothing, bad people will prevail. That is the story of public school education in the 20th century. There has been a lot of prevailing going on.
The Education Establishment’s great triumph is to make themselves appear safe, not too threatening, somehow not prime players. All their bad theories and methods somehow turn up on their own, unlucky accidents. There is the big mistake that Americans make.
The Education Establishment controls what goes on in K-12 classrooms. Give these people credit, and then give them blame and punishment. If we don’t, then we deserve the schools we end up with.

0001270,Russia Russia Russia,"Since the mass media (and therefore public opinion) is swamped with the Russia Russia Russia propaganda, here's a quick synopsis of all the *facts* you sadly can't find on our American television or ""news"" outlets:
To begin with, our elections are anything but democratic or un-influenced. The party representatives are selected by very small groups of wealthy people, who also maintain the chosen loyalist (ie, financially-incentivized) pool of ""Superdelegates"" for counteracting the wills of *entire states*. When the DNC was sued their court defense was that they have no actual obligation to perform fair elections. They repealed every protection possible against unlimited or foreign campaign donations and lobbying. Every news outlet was Trump 24/7 in an attempt to win it for Hillary through ""lesser evilism""- a theory Democrats use often, but which backfired.
Forced to choose between two hated millionaires, stuck between the establishment corruption or a liar's claim of anti-establishmentism, left this country totally divided. But the numbers don't lie. The problem was that neither of these warmongering, egomaniac corporatists represented the people. For a country that facilitates daily atrocities on foreign ground by using the excuse of ""defending democracy,"" we don't actually practice it. Such direct control is referred to as ""mob rule"", and to be stopped at all costs for the ""good"" of the country. Or, at least for the good of wealthy politicians, lobbyists, and businesses who profit off our military industrial complex.
What Russia was accused of doing is merely running a phishing scheme which 'resulted' in Wikileaks airing an email assortment of the DNC's dirty laundry. Ignoring all content (because that would lay some blame at their own feet) and ignoring the polls (which all predicted a Clinton loss against Trump) it became the DNC's go-to excuse that Russian interference was the reason for their loss. Then Hillary-backing three-letter agencies signed off on their ""it looks like it could be the kind of attack that one might expect to see from Russian hackers"" report, which then got blown up into ""Russia hacked our election"" through media hype, obfuscation, and repetition.
That was the entire source of the supposed moral outrage, and honestly it's entirely hypocritical when we consider how many foreign elections or even entire governments those same agencies have been manipulating with economic and military impunity. Maybe some are OK with corruption, as long as it is only *us* doing it. I'm not. Why should I have more fear from Russia's ""influence"" than those actively accepting bribes? Does domestic tyranny really come second to any conveniently imagined foreign scapegoat? And why should I believe the word of the same folk proven to (in their own leaked words) have maintained this duplicitous ""public and private face""?
I am not anti-American, a secret spy, or a Republican by saying that Russian election talk is wasting our time and just makes us useful idiots to the Democratic-funded new ""activism"" which re-frames our problems with a couple quick historical rewrites and anti-Trump false nationalism. This country is getting split up into factions; remaining divided, those in power stay in power, while we blame everyone else. Yet fixing our governmental and electoral corruption would mean nobody has to worry about Russia.

0001271,Why Do Radical Muslims Hate America So Much?,"Americans know that the United States has been engaged in the War on Terror for the past 10 years. But how many Americans can answer the question of why radical Muslims hate us so much?
The United States has spent nearly $1.3 trillion on the war effort – a figure that dwarfs the Vietnam War ($738 billion), the Korean War ($341 billon), and World War I ($334 billion). And the United States has lost more than 6,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But again, can the average American explain why radical Muslims attacked the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2011, and why terrorist groups continue to recruit and scheme to attack us? Most likely the answer is no.
Jim Denison, a cultural apologist and former senior pastor of the 10,000-member Park Cities Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, sets out to answer that question in his new book Radical Islam: What You Need to Know.
According to Denison, who has lived and traveled among Muslims for some 30 years, there are two major parts to the answer. The first part is radical Muslims claim that the West has been attacking Islam since the crusades, with Pope Urban II announcing the First Crusade in 1095.
The First Crusade began the West’s attack on the “ummah,” or collective community of Muslims worldwide that transcends geography and time. An attack on any of Islam’s followers is seen as an attack on all Muslims because the ummah, or community, is attacked.
British-American historian Bernard Lewis, Cleveland E. Dodge professor emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, writes in his 2004 book, The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror:
""In the Western world, the basic unit of human organization is the nation, in America but not European usage virtually synonymous with country. This is then subdivided in various ways, one of which is by religion. Muslims, however, tend to see not a nation subdivided into religious groups but a religion subdivided into nations.""
With this logic, the United States’ support of Israel in the conflict with Palestinians is seen as America’s attack on all Muslims worldwide.
“The Quran requires Muslims to defend Islam. So if you believe we are attacking Islam then as a Muslim you are required to attack us in defense of your faith,” explained Denison about radical Muslims’ worldview to The Christian Post.
Osama bin Laden published a
“The answer is very simple: Because you attacked us and continue to attack us,” bin Laden stated in the letter.
Extremists also claim the United States attacks Islam not only by supporting Israel and with our military presence in the Middle East, but also by exporting our culture through movies, music, the Internet, and other forms of mass communication.
“They see all of that as an imposition of a hedonist, secular culture on the Muslim world. In their world, at least in most of the Muslim world, there is not a significant distinction between faith and life, between church and state as we might say,” Denison notes.
The second major reason to the question of why radical Muslims hate America is based on their understanding of democracy. Because the American people elect the U.S. government and our taxes support the military, Muslim extremists hold American civilians accountable for the “war on Islam.”
“There are no innocent civilians. They see us the way you would see Germans who supported Hitler or Japanese who supported the emperor,” Denison explained. “In their minds, you and I are complicit in this attack on Islam.”
“In the mind of a radical Muslim, 9/11 was not an unprovoked attack on Americans. 9/11 was a defense of Islam, striking back at the heart of Western crusader, imperialist aggression; the twin towers – financial; Pentagon – military; White House – political.”
Again, Osama Bin Laden’s “Letter to America” points to the U.S.’s system of democracy to explain why American civilians are guilty for the deaths of Palestinian Muslims and those in Afghanistan, Somalia, Chechnya and Kashmir.
But the vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. The Gallup poll conducted the largest-ever survey of predominantly Islamic countries after the Sept. 11 attacks and found 7 percent of the Muslim world has been radicalized.
That means 93 percent of Muslims in the world are peaceful. But that also means that 7 percent of 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, which translates to 112 million Muslims, are radical.
“We need to understand that it (radical Islam) is an enemy unlike any we have ever fought, and this is a war unlike any we have fought. Osama bin Laden was not Hitler. They are not seeking to defend a single city like Berlin. There is not a single leader with whom we can negotiate a truce,” stated Denison. “This is the battle of our lifetime. In fact, many scholars are beginning to call it the long war.
“We are going to face terrorism just as we face cancer, wildfires, and floods. I am afraid that it is simply going to be part of life in the 21st century.”
Denison, who founded the Denison Forum on Truth and Culture in 2009, suggests the United States continue to build relationships with moderate Muslim nations, encourage democracy in the world, promote economic progress in the Muslim world, help negotiate peace in the Middle East, and remain vigilant against terrorist threats.

0001280,How We're Dehumanizing Muslim Filipinos With This ID,"In 1919, the Supreme Court validated the Philippine government’s action of forcing the Mangyans (manguianes) to live in a reservation or camp based on the logic that our indigenous brothers and sisters from Mindoro were “uncivilized.” Filipinos were thus divided into civilized and uncivilized, where the latter was deprived of their right to liberty. In 1939, the Supreme Court again upheld the logic that our indigenous brothers and sisters were uncivilized when it affirmed the conviction of a native of Baguio for illegal possession of intoxicating liquor, a drink apparently only civilized people can handle.
Fast forward to 2000, when the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 and finally gave dignity to the humanity of our indigenous brothers and sisters.
But which historical fate will our Muslim brothers and sisters meet? I hope we don’t experience déjà vu.
The Police Regional Director of Central Luzon, Senior Supt. Aaron Aquino, plans to issue mandatory IDs that all Muslim residents must obtain and wear in the region. Such a plan is already being implemented in Paniqui, Tarlac, according to Human Rights Watch. The supposedly lofty goal is to “identify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists.” PNP Chief Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa doesn’t see any problem with the plan.
A Muslim-only ID would be a denial of the guarantee of equal protection.
But no goal will ever justify discrimination and violation of people’s rights—and the logic behind this is highly questionable to begin with.
A Muslim-only ID perpetuates if not cements the notion that only Muslims are and can be terrorists. The frequent, unquestioned use by irresponsible journalists of the labels “Islamic terrorist” or “Muslim terrorist” in their news reports have indeed created a false association between being a Muslim and being a terrorist. The logic is painfully obvious: not all Muslims are terrorists and not all terrorists are Muslims.
The National People’s Army (NPA) frequently commits terrorism when it commits crime to demand revolutionary taxes or issues some other illegal demand. But the media doesn’t report the crimes as being committed by “atheist terrorists” or “Christian terrorists,” even if some members of the NPA are atheist or Christian. For example, the so-called Manila hostage crisis in 2010 technically falls under the legal definition of terrorism—committing a crime with the purpose of sowing fear and panic to coerce the government to give in to an unlawful demand. But the media called it a hostage crisis, not terrorism. And the media didn’t inquire into the hostage taker’s religion.
To really identify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists, we must recognize that terrorists can come from any religious background. If an ID system would help, it would help to make it mandatory for everyone. To impose it only on our Muslim brothers and sisters would be discriminatory and illegal. A Muslim-only ID would violate our laws and the Constitution, which guarantees basic human rights. I can give a litany of laws that would be violated, but let’s limit it to two.
First, Article III Section 1 of the Constitution says: “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the law.”
A Muslim-only ID would be a deprivation of liberty of Muslim Filipinos without due process. Due process here means that there should be a rational connection between the goal the government wants to achieve and the means it uses to try and achieve that goal. It’s painfully obvious again that there is no rational connection—anyone can be a terrorist, not only Muslims. And belief in Islam or being a Muslim doesn’t make a person a terrorist. There are many peace-loving and law-abiding Muslim Filipinos and very few Muslim terrorists—again, a label that some journalists irresponsibly use (they should really stop using that).
A Muslim-only ID would be a denial of the guarantee of equal protection. While the government can classify people and treat them differently in other instances (senior citizens, for example), such treatment should be based on substantial distinction. There is no rhyme or reason in classifying Muslims or Christians—or any other religion for that matter—differently. Again: there is nothing to distinguish a Muslim from a Christian in their likelihood to be a criminal or terrorist. There is nothing. Nothing.
Again: there is nothing to distinguish a Muslim from a Christian in their likelihood to be a criminal or terrorist. There is nothing. Nothing.
Second, Article III Section 5 of the Constitution says: “No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.” Under our laws, the right to travel is part of our civil rights. A Muslim-only ID would require a religious test for the followers of Islam so they can exercise their right to travel—such as evacuating and fleeing from Marawi and resettling in Central Luzon. The Philippines will seem to be endorsing Christianity or other religions for Filipinos given that their exercise of their right to travel is easier if they weren’t Muslims and weren’t required to register and wear an ID.
But regardless of the legality, to impose a Muslim-only ID would lead us further down the path that Hitler and Nazi Germany took. Is this alarmist? How I wish.
The Nazis required Jews to wear a yellow badge or the Star of David so they could easily be identified. This heightened, if not cemented, Germany’s anti-Semitism and contributed to the tragedy that is the Holocaust. You see, one of the main reasons why people can and do massacre other people is because of dehumanization. When people are stripped of their humanity and made out to be different from you, it is easy for these people to become the “other.” Someone else we don’t need to care about. Someone else we can treat differently because they are not like us. They are not humans.
And so we must stop dehumanization in any form. Drug addicts have already been dehumanized and are being tagged in barangay watch lists. Muslims are now in danger of being dehumanized and tagged with a Muslim-only ID system. The dignity and humanity of all people must be respected. Otherwise, our own dignity and humanity will be in danger.
If a Muslim-only ID is further implemented beyond Central Luzon, I will stand in solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters. I will register as a Muslim. I will register as a human being.",unknown,True

0001283,Christian nationalism: Good for politicians the world,"By Peter Montgomery
Why did white evangelicals support Trump? To keep America Christian.
White evangelical Christians voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, despite his well-documented character flaws and moral failings. It turns out that their support wasn’t just about hatred of Hillary Clinton or Trump’s promise to give them the Supreme Court of their dreams.
A new study points to another more disturbing motivating force: Christian nationalism.
The study was conducted by scholars at Clemson University, East Tennessee State, and the University of Oklahoma. “The more someone believed the United States is — and should be — a Christian nation, the more likely they were to vote for Trump,” the researchers found.
The scholars looked at whether people agreed or disagreed with half a dozen statements, such as “The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation.” Voters who scored high on that scale believed that “Trump would defend what they saw as the country’s Christian heritage — and would help move the nation toward a distinctly Christian future,” the study’s authors wrote in a Washington Post column.
The only other cultural explanation that predicted voting behavior so powerfully was the level of fear and antagonism toward Muslims. Of course, the two are not unrelated.
Some Christian-nation advocates promote false history, claiming that the First Amendment’s protections for religious liberty were meant only for Christians. Some prominent conservative activists argue that American Muslims are not protected by the First Amendment, going so far as to claim that Islam is not even a religion, or that Muslims cannot truthfully take an oath to uphold the Constitution.
Sad to say, these attitudes aren’t restricted to a few folks out on the far fringes.
The Family Research Council, for example, hosts an annual gathering of Christian conservative activists that Trump has attended both as candidate and as president. FRC president Tony Perkins has gushed about how often he’s invited to the White House, and former FRC staffers have taken influential jobs in the administration.
Perkins defended Trump’s 2015 call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., saying that “only 16 percent of Islam is a religion — the rest is a combination of military, judicial, economic, and political system.”
Perkins’ colleague and FRC’s executive vice president, retired General Jerry Boykin, has a long track record of anti-Muslim rhetoric, including the claims that Islam is not a religion and that Muslims don’t deserve First Amendment protections.
Rhetoric that implies that “real” Americans are Christian — like rhetoric that implies that “real” Americans are white — isn’t only wrong, it’s dangerous.
Rhetorical attacks on immigrants and Muslims by Trump and his allies, and the promotion of anti-Semitic tropes by some of his fans in the alt-right, have contributed to a spike in anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes directed at immigrants, Muslims, and even people wrongly perceived by attackers to be immigrants or Muslims.
That harm isn’t just limited to people in the United States, either.
At a recent event sponsored by Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, former diplomats warned that the rise in religious intolerance at home — specifically anti-Muslim bigotry and ethno-nationalism — threatens the ability of the United States to advocate effectively for the human rights of religious minorities facing sometimes brutal repression in other parts of the world.
One speaker added that the rise in anti-Muslim bigotry in the U.S. acts as a recruiting tool for terrorist organizations.
Rejecting America’s commitment to religious pluralism is therefore not only a betrayal of American values, which contributes to a growing climate of intolerance in the United States. It also represents the abandonment of people around the world who look to America and American ideals for hope.

0001286,The Magical Thinking Opposition,"My hypothesis is that the political side that is out of power is the one that hallucinates the most — and needs to — in order to keep their worldview intact. For example, when President Obama was in office, I saw all kinds of hallucinations on the right about his intentions to destroy America from the inside because he “hates” it.
That was a mass hysteria. If President Obama wanted to destroy America, he failed miserably. We’re stronger than ever.
The birther issue started as ordinary political shenanigans to delegitimize the president. I call it ordinary because you see the trick used whenever it is an option, as it was with “Canadian” Ted Cruz in the primaries. Eventually it morphed into a full-blown hallucination that President Obama was a Muslim sleeper cell from Kenya, or something like that. That was mass hysteria.
Now that Democrats are out of power, we should expect them to hallucinate like crazy (literally) because the election results of 2016 shattered their expectations. Do we see signs of their hallucinations? I’ll walk you through a few examples.
Hallucination:
Based on President Trump’s tweets and speeches, I can see into his soul, and it is all darkness and racism in there.
Real:
If the President of the United States tries anything racist in the real world, the Supreme Court, Congress, and the voters would shut him down in a heartbeat. For example, the Courts modified President Trump’s immigration ban to remove even the perception of racism. That’s a sensitive filter for racism, and I think we like it that way.
Society’s standard is that you are judged for what you do, not what you privately think. That’s good because humans are terrible at knowing what other people think, while at the same time we think we are good at it. I know this first-hand because dozens of people misinterpret what I write on social media every day. If you don’t have my type of experience — of being routinely misinterpreted — you might think humans are good at reading minds based on subtle clues. We are not good at that. We might be slightly better than random chance, at best. The problem is that we are dead-certain we are champions of evidence-based mindreading. That is a hallucination.
Hallucination:
I can spot a racist by how long it takes them to properly disavow other racists.
Real:
That isn’t a thing. The first rule of communicating is that people only hear what they think you intend to say. They don’t hear what you actually say. If you think someone is a racist, you will perceive their disavowals of racism as too late and too inadequate. If you think someone is not a racist, you might see their statements as politically incorrect and nothing worse. This phenomenon is most pronounced when strong emotions are involved. The topic of racism stirs our strongest emotions. So according to everything we know about brains, we should expect the highest level of hallucinations when racism is the topic. And that is exactly what we observe.
To be clear, racism itself is very real. The hallucination is limited to seeing it under every bed and behind every couch.
Hallucination:
The president has accomplished nothing!
Real:
The president has accomplished a
That said, we are 13% into President Trump’s first term, and Congress has created no major bills worthy of signing. Congress is tasked with working out the details of bills. The president can’t do his job until they do theirs.
We observe that the president has not shown leadership on any major legislation. But keep in mind that Congress produced nothing worthy of leadership. Would any leader be able to fix that? Yes, but I assume it takes longer than simply signing bills that come to your desk. Especially in this hyper-polarized environment.
Hallucination:
President Trump is performing poorly!
Real:
Compared to what? The imaginary president in your head? There is no base case with which to compare any president’s performance. Would Hillary Clinton have passed major legislation with a Republican Congress in less than six months? It seems unlikely. But we can’t know because she isn’t president.
We are terrible at judging how well a stranger performs compared to the imaginary person in our minds. We just think we are good at it.
Hallucination:
If you thought some “fine people” were marching with Nazis and KKK in Charlottesville, you are a racist.
Real:
I condemn all racists and anyone who marches with them. But It turns out that some
He wisely left the facts alone after failing on the empathy.
Hallucination:
This country needs moral leadership and we are not getting it!
Real:
The country does not need moral leadership in 2017. Social media has filled that void. The country is unified (let’s say 98%) in condemning the KKK and other racists in Charlottesville. We did that without moral leadership. We want moral leadership, but there is no evidence we need it.
We would also like to know our president has the right intentions. But hallucinations on that topic are nearly unfixable. Obama never fixed it. Trump will not either.
Hallucination:
The way you worded your statement, you made a moral equivalence between the KKK and people protesting the KKK.
Real:
Literally no one but the KKK and other extreme racists has any trouble understanding that Nazis are worse than the people protesting against hate. It is a hallucination (or political tricksterism) to suggest normal citizens can’t distinguish the moral difference between Nazis and those demonstrating against racism.
I could go on, but I think you are starting to see the picture. The party out of power has to hallucinate to make their world make sense. The people who think they are smart and morally pure don’t understand why their side lost an election. The simplest fix for that broken worldview is to imagine there are far more “secret racists” than they first assumed, and those people can be identified by the way they accidentally reveal their “moral equivalence” opinions that look exactly like law-and-order opinions to others.
I could go on, but I think you get the idea. Cognitive dissonance hits the losing team hardest. It has to, because only the losing side need to make sense of it all. The winning side thinks things are going exactly as expected. They have no trigger for hallucinating.
If our next president is a Democrat, expect the Right to do most of the hallucinating. The Left will think things are going as expected.

0001289,"Hillary: Investigating me would be a symptom of a ‘dictatorship, like some authoritarian regime’","If there’s one thing the Clintons have always been able to count on, it’s that they’re above the law. The rules that apply to the little people Hillary so despises have never been applied to her own family. Time will tell if that’s really going to change but, now that their political power is on the wane, it at least appears as if their ability to dodge the consequences of their actions has diminished.
The other day, Dan wrote about the New York Times’s previously unimaginable decision to call out Bill’s history of sexual predation. That alone may not seem like much but, since the Times was once a reliable mouthpiece for the Clintons, it says volumes about their current lack of influence.
Then there’s that pesky Uranium One scandal.
Despite media efforts to portray the whole thing as conspiracy theory, there are still plenty of questions regarding the Russian money that flowed to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was Secretary of State. In fact, there are enough questions that rumors of a special council persist - this despite Trey Gowdy’s comments yesterday.
So, the fine, upstanding, leftists over at Mother Jones decided to ask Mrs. Clinton about the possibility that she might finally face a thorough investigation. Her answer, as you’d expect, is 100% wrong.
From
Hillary Clinton responded on Wednesday to news that the Trump administration is considering appointing a special counsel to investigate her alleged ties to the Uranium One deal, calling the move “a disastrous step into politicizing the Justice Department” and “such an abuse of power.”
In an exclusive interview with Mother Jones, Clinton said such an investigation would have devastating consequences for the justice system in America. “If they send a signal that we’re going to be like some dictatorship, like some authoritarian regime, where political opponents are going to be unfairly, fraudulently investigated, that rips at the fabric of the contract we have, that we can trust our justice system,” Clinton said. “It will be incredibly demoralizing to people who have served at the Justice Department, under both Republicans and Democrats, because they know better. But it will also send a terrible signal to our country and the world that somehow we are giving up on the kind of values that we used to live by and we used to promote worldwide.”
First, the “Justice System in America” is built on the notion that no one - not even the saintly Clinton family - is above its reach. If there’s reason to investigate Hillary, and God knows there are probably at least half a dozen, then so be it. The idea that, somehow, applying the law to Mrs. Clinton’s actions would damage the justice system is ludicrous. Letting people dodge culpability and enjoy the fruits of their transgressions simply because they have the right last name? Now that damages our faith in the justice system - and Hillary &amp; Co. have been doing it for decades.
Second, James Comey’s decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton - after laying out a detailed list of prosecutable offenses - damaged American faith in the justice system far more that any special counsel ever could.
Finally, if Hillary really wants to examine who’s been using the DOJ as a weapon, she should look no further than the Obama administration in which she served. From Fast &amp; Furious, to a refusal to enforce laws it didn’t like, to “
Hillary’s game has always been to portray herself as the target of wild-eyed right-wing conspiracies. She’s been doing it since the early nineties. If there was any actual Justice left in this government, her victim card would be revoked, and she’d find herself at the center of multiple investigations.

0001290,Invasion of Leftist Body Snatchers,"My biggest frustration is seeing conservative/Christian family members and friends overtaken by liberalism. I think it happens when they’re alone in the dark sleeping. Liberalism takes over their body like in that movie, “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.” One morning they awake saying, “The second amendment is outdated. Jesus approves homosexual marriage. Historical monuments hurt black lives. Rich successful Americans must be punished.”
Family members and friends who suddenly embrace the dark side believe they are simply being fair. Fake news media, Hollywood, Democrats and public education pounds them daily with lies about how mean and unfair America is to blacks, women, illegals, the poor and so on. Conservatives/Christians are being suckered into believing various groups are victimized daily by America’s racism, sexism and white privilege.

They are not simply seeking entry, they have been in these places for decades. Homosexuals are stealthily demanding enthusiastic approval of their lifestyle.
What sticks in my craw is homosexual activists being allowed to blatantly deceive and bully the American people. They say they only desire tolerance. They are lying. I don’t know about you, but I have loved and tolerated homosexual family and friends all my life. But that is no longer good enough.

0001292,"Mouth control, not more gun control, is what we need","While the left side of the political spectrum responded to the mass shooting in Las Vegas with fevered calls for gun controls, which even Democrats admit would not have prevented the massacre, they have done nothing to rein in their hateful rhetoric demonizing Trump supporters and providing clear incitements to deranged individuals like Stephen Paddock to commit heinous acts of violence. Leftist celebrity Nancy Sinatra notoriously tweeted “Murderous members of NRA should face firing squad” – to express her politically correct assumption that a gun, rather than an individual incited by hateful comments like hers, was responsible for the slaughter.
Nor are Democrats unaware that their reckless rhetorical attacks can have deadly results. Republican Congressman Steve Scalise nearly lost his life at the hands of a Bernie Sanders supporting Democrat, James T. Hodgkinson, during a baseball game this summer. Just last week a local prosecutor officially found that the shooter committed an “act of terrorism” that was “fueled by rage against Republican legislators.” Nonetheless Union County, New Jersey Democrat operative
This was at least honest. The moment Donald Trump was declared the victor in November, Democrat leaders launched a “Resistance” to his presidency. Not a democratic opposition to policies he might enact. But a resistance to his presidency. Consequently Trump was the first president since Abraham Lincoln to get no “presidential honeymoon.” Congressional Democrats even boycotted his inaugural, and instead of confirmation hearings they mounted a witch-hunt against his nominees, painting colleagues like Jeff Sessions as a “racist” even though they were well aware of his stellar record on civil rights.
Instead of uniting the country behind its new duly elected president – a crucial responsibility of the opposition party in a democracy – the Democratic leadership then embraced a series of mass “Not My President” protests. The largest of these was the so-called “Women’s March,” which was held in cities across the country and whose two chief organizers were a convicted Islamic terrorist, Rasmea Odeh, and an Islamic terrorist supporter, Linda Sarsour. Months later, speaking from a platform provided by the Muslim Brotherhood, Sarsour said “I hope, that when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad. We are struggling against tyrants and rulers not only abroad in the Middle East but here in the United States of America, where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.”
In Washington the Women’s March featured celebrity entertainer and Hillary supporter Madonna, who, wearing a black pussy hat, announced she had thought “an awful lot about blowing up the White House.” At the same demonstration, actress Ashley Judd proclaimed “I am a nasty woman,” then added “I am not as nasty as racism, fraud, conflict of interest, homophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance, white privilege.” A month later, Judd said of Trump’s election victory, “It remains for me the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my lifetime.” She also grotesquely compared the election result to sexual assault. “Raped as a child – bad. Re-raped by a political system that ordains a clown – really bad.”
We don’t yet know the motive or motives behind Paddock’s Vegas attack. But the fact that he chose a country and western concert rather than a rock concert or hip-hop event may indicate an animus against possible Trump supporters.
Whatever Paddock’s motives, Democrats and their left-wing supporters have been exploiting the tragedy to whip up more hatred against their Republican opponents such as that expressed in Nancy Sinatra’s murderous tweet. Trump’s defeated Democratic opponent, Hillary, was quick to use the massacre as an excuse to bash Republicans and the National Rifle Association (NRA).
“The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots,” she tweeted the morning after. “Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.” Of course, a silencer, also called a suppressor, would have melted as a result of the intense heat generated by a continuous-fire weapon and would have only muffled the sound a little. Moreover, a silencer would not conceal the hundreds of wounded victims falling alongside those not yet hit and warning them of the peril they faced. “Our grief isn’t enough,” Clinton added one minute later in an extravagantly hypocritical afterthought. “We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.”
Continued below...
Hillary supporter and CBS executive Hayley Geftman-Gold used the massacre to rant against Trump and Republicans. She blamed Republicans for the deaths caused by Paddock because they wouldn’t endorse stronger gun control as she expressed indifference to the murders because the audience, she guessed, was probably composed of Republicans. “I have no hope that Repugs [sic] will ever do the right thing. I’m actually not even sympathetic [because] country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” CBS executives immediately fired Geftman-Gold, showing a concern for public civility that Democratic Party leaders would do well to emulate.
While Democrats call for gun control they project a steady stream of wild-eyed rhetoric and venomous rationales for violence against their political opponents. This is not only not useful in a democracy. It is downright dangerous.

The Trump voters now have a far less favorable opinion – almost the reverse of where they stood before the president’s speech in Alabama – of the NFL than the Clinton voters. The gap is so wide now that the NFL now ranks seventh on the list of America’s most divisive brands.

I immediately applauded Kaepernick for using the art of protest to spark a national dialogue. People are dying. We are in the eye of a cultural crisis in America.
Kaepernick put endorsements at risk and clearly angered many. Some complained he was anti-American. On the contrary, I thought his action was pro-American, following in the tradition of Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Protest is an American right, which Colin peacefully exercised.
But here is where Kaepernick lost me: His remarks to the press segued into a rant of the type you hear from the conservative right. He said: ""I mean, you have Hillary who's called black teens or black kids super predators. You have Donald Trump who's openly racist. I mean, we have a presidential candidate [Hillary Clinton] who's deleted emails and done things illegally and is a presidential candidate. That doesn't make sense to me, because if that was any other person, you'd be in prison.""
To lump Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the same category is wrong, offensive and uninformed. Trump isn't even in the same category as former President George W. Bush or former Vice President Dick Cheney. Donald Trump isn't a Republican or even a conservative. He's a rich, famous alleged businessman who has money to burn and a disturbing case of narcissism.
It's irresponsible for Kaepernick to insinuate that Clinton should be in jail, with words that skirt close to the shouts of ""Lock her up!"" from the crowd during Gov. Chris Christie's remarks at the Republican National Convention. After months of investigations into whether charges should be brought against Clinton for her use of a private email server,
I believe the FBI knows more about Clinton's emails than Kaepernick. [Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article included the sentence ""We should trust the FBI,"" which the writer had not intended to include.] In addition, Clinton has owned her mistakes. Donald Trump owns nothing; he believes he is flawless, appearing to make grudging concessions of regret (only once) as a feint when bringing on a new team to revive his campaign.
I have been critical of many of Hillary Clinton's positions. However, she knows she is not above critique. During the primaries, she was protested by Black Lives Matter. Her response? She didn't encourage violence and then offer to pay medical bills for people who threw punches, like Trump;
From the start of her campaign,
Trump's pitch to African-Americans? ""You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?""
Kaepernick referenced her 1996 comment ""super predators."" Sadly, he quoted her as falsely as Donald Trump did. She didn't specifically call black teens or black kids super predators. She was referencing gang culture, but many interpreted the term as racially coded language. I agree, and I despised the term.
Nonetheless, Clinton
Additionally, African-Americans have held the Clintons accountable for years. It's a myth that African-Americans blindly supported the Clintons.
The African-American community is not a robotic voting bloc. Cornel West, Michelle Alexander, Marc Lamont Hill, Melissa Harris-Perry and other thought leaders have been deeply critical of Hillary, but with nuance. Hillary Clinton has worked for the black vote.
Colin Kaepernick, I want to tell you something: I am a black man who lives in a black and predominately immigrant neighborhood. I, my friends, my family and my neighbors cannot afford a Trump presidency. Our very being would be at risk -- on issues from health care to immigration, to the right to marry to the makeup of the Supreme Court and all that would portend.
Although Kaepernick is a person of color and has experienced prejudice, he sits in a space of economic privilege -- a man who
It takes time to grow into activism. There is space for him to evolve and learn. His intentions were clearly genuine. While Kaepernick sitting during the national anthem was profound, his words about the Democratic nominee were disappointing and, quite frankly, misguided.
Colin, your voice is needed. Please don't encourage anyone to bench their vote. We cannot let Trump become president. This is not the football field. This is not a game. You are blessed to live in a world where your livelihood is protected, but for the rest of us, we can't endure a President Trump.",unknown,True
0001305,5 Reasons White Supremacists Are The Dumbest Weirdos On Earth,"White supremacists tend to use two flags as the defining symbols of their movement: the flag of Nazi Germany and the Confederate flag (YES I KNOW IT'S TECHNICALLY ""THE BATTLE FLAG OF THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA"" BUT LITERALLY EVERYONE ASSOCIATES IT AS THE FLAG OF THE CONFEDERACY SO GET OVER IT). What do these flags have in common, besides symmetrical designs and WAY too much red? Easy. They're the flags of LOSERS.
In an incredibly bizarre turn of events, white supremacists have decided that the flags of two of history's most famously abject losers are the kind of iconography they wanna attach themselves to. Sure, both the Confederacy and Nazi Germany had super-racist belief systems at their very foundations, but they're also notable for getting BRUTALLY beaten because they both sucked ass pretty bad.
White supremacists associating themselves with shitty losers? Who could have seen THAT coming?
It's kinda nuts to imagine that the greatest historical leader of the white supremacist movement is Adolf Hitler, a man who famously tested out cyanide pills on HIS DOG because he wanted to make sure they worked and didn't want to suffer too much when committing suicide. Hitler, for all of his powerful oratory and bluster, was a weak little wimp (and couldn't even grow a decent full mustache) who sucked at painting and who
Who else are their heroic leaders? Richard Spencer, the guy currently famous for constantly getting punched and fleeing? David Duke, the former head of the KKK who wrote a book under a female pseudonym explaining how to give blowjobs and receive anal sex? Steve Bannon, the lumpy
Every hero the white supremacist movement has holds one thing in common: they're utter failures as human beings (even discounting their inherently detestable belief systems) who are also largely ugly as hell. Seriously, how can you honestly say your race is genetically-superior when your hero looks like this?
Strom Thurmond holds a special place in the hearts of white supremacists for several reasons - his virulent campaign against the civil rights movement, his longstanding record of the longest congressional filibuster in opposition of ending segregation, and for being a hilarious hypocritical racist (okay they probably weren't a fan of this last bit).
Yep - Strom Thurmond, infamous racist / terrifying zombie senator, famously fathered Essie Mae Washington-Williams...the daughter of a black woman who worked for his parents (and who was only 16 at the time). So not only was Thurmond espousing racist views and policies to denigrate African-Americans nonstop, but he was sleeping with and impregnating an (underage) African-American at the same time.
And in case you're looking for a more modern example (given there is nothing less modern than Strom Thurmond), look no further than Mike Enoch - the pseudonym of a popular alt-right podcaster and blogger who regularly espoused insanely racist, neo-Nazi beliefs - the usual mix of anti-Muslim, anti-African-American, and anti-Semitism...
That's the thing about these people - they espouse hatred and ignorance and use their positions of influence in the worst possible manner, and they're NOT EVEN GOOD AT BEING RACIST.
Here's the thing: ""race"" is a completely meaningless term. There is no such thing as a biological race - we are all humans and part of the same species, and literally everything else is minor aesthetic differences that ultimately mean nothing. This has been
Want to know how meaningless the idea of ""the white race"" is? What was considered ""white"" has been in fluctuation for as long as the term existed - it's pretty well known that in the earlier part of the 20th century, there was a good amount of racism coming from white supremacists against individuals of Italian and Irish descent. And even as of recently, white supremacists seem more welcoming to lighter-skinned people of Hispanic descent. The point is - it doesn't mean anything, except what racists WANT it to mean.
And even if you were the type to think it meant something, ultimately each individual's ancestry is open to interpretation: if 86% of your ancestors were members of what you consider to be ""the white race,"" but 14% were of African descent, are you considered white? Well, we could just ask notorious white supremacist Craig Cobb,
What it all boils down to is this: THE ENTIRE BASIS OF RACISM IS STUPID. Hell, ALL prejudice is stupid - to judge individuals or groups based on arbitrary categorizations and biases makes zero actual sense.
Anyways, just thought we should get that one out of the way.
Listen - if you're going to espouse beliefs that certain races are better than others and that certain races should be discriminated against, that makes you a racist. I'm not trying to be insulting, that's just the actual dictionary definition of ""racist."" And yet, for some reason, people who are objectively racists get really mad when people refer to them as such:
If you're a racist, at least OWN it a little.",unknown,True

Having the world see an American president bend over backward to secure such a terrible deal has had far-reaching consequences that go well beyond Iran's nuclear program.
Before the deal was finalized, President Obama expressed hope that signing it would strengthen moderate forces inside Iran. Nothing of the sort has occurred, as Iran has grown more emboldened by the administration's efforts to protect the deal whether Iran complies or not.
This is most obvious in the chaos and destruction Iran is sowing across the Middle East. Iran has continued to develop ballistic missiles, a direct threat to our allies in the region, especially Israel. Earlier this year, Iran launched two missiles, one inscribed with ""Israel must be wiped out"" in Hebrew,

But with each passing day, it becomes more painfully obvious that this deal has made our country less secure, and the U.S. taxpayer money President Obama gave to Iran is being used to support terrorism and help in the killing of thousands of innocent people in Syria and elsewhere.

0001307,"Trump Just Attacked The DOJ, Gets His A** Handed To Him By Sally Yates (TWEET)","Donald Trump dropped several shocking statements in his outrageous interview with
In the interview, Trump clearly stated that if he’d known Attorney General Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from overseeing the Russian investigation, he never would have nominated the former Alabama senator. Trump also warned Special Counsel Robert Mueller against investigating his family’s financial matters.
These statements are shocking and extremely unpresidential, but unfortunately we’ve come to expect this from Trump and his highly flawed administration. But one person, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, isn’t going to let this slide. Having experienced Trump’s wrath firsthand when she was fired by him several months ago for getting in the way of the infamous Muslim travel ban, Yates has been an outspoken opponent of Trump and has been giving him hell ever since.
In a brutal message posted on Twitter, Yates trashed Trump for attacking a “bedrock principle of our democracy” with his disrespectful comments about the Department of Justice. She wrote:
“POTUS attack on Russia recusal reveals yet again his violation of the essential independence of DOJ, a bedrock principle of our democracy.”
While Trump still seems to think he can fire everyone who poses a threat to him, Yates is the perfect example that just because Trump strips people of their power and positions, he can’t get them to shut up and stop exposing him. Yates has become a highly respected figure after she was responsible for shutting down Trump’s Muslim ban, and the American people play attention to what she says. If Trump thought he could make her fade into the background by taking away her job, Yates has just proved him very, VERY wrong.
