	<article id="0000646" published-at="2016-10-26" title="The Crazy Republican-Endorsed Logic Behind “If Trump Loses, I’m Grabbing My Musket.”"><p>Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images</p> A man (not Joe Walsh) points a rifle at a gun show. The Republican Party has embraced the “insurrectionist” theory of the Second Amendment, which holds that individuals should violently overthrow an overly oppressive government using firearms. <p>Former Republican Congressman and <a type="internal">Tea Party darling</a> Joe Walsh took to Twitter on Wednesday to announce his post-election day plans. “On November 9th,” he wrote, “if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?”</p> <q> <p>On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump.On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket.You in?</p>— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) <a href="https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/791369493809201152" type="external">October 26, 2016</a> </q> <p>Walsh frequently <a type="internal">says horrific things</a> on Twitter, and it may be tempting to write off this latest proclamation as his standard fevered lunacy. But <a type="internal">as I noted in August</a>, this sentiment—that a Donald Trump loss might justify the violent overthrow of a Hillary Clinton administration—is really just the logical endpoint of a longtime GOP talking point. The National Rifle Association has longed peddled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393345831/?tag=slatmaga-20" type="external">the “insurrectionist” theory</a> of the Second Amendment, arguing that the right to bear arms was intended to protect citizens against a tyrannical ruler. According to this theory, individuals must have access to firearms in order to revolt against an overly oppressive government. The purpose of the amendment, then, isn’t merely self-defense, but a right to assassinate a leader who unduly restricts liberty.</p> <p>Although this insurrectionist theory is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/11/opinion/jefferson-fake-gun-quotation/" type="external">entirely made up</a> and utterly foreign to the Supreme Court’s <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2132&amp;context=fss_papers" type="external">interpretation</a> of the Second Amendment, it has gained a foothold in the Republican Party. In 2010, Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/16/sharron-angle-floated-2nd_n_614003.html" type="external">suggested</a> that Nevadans might use “Second Amendment remedies” to punish an overly liberal Congress. In 2014, Iowa Republican (and current senator) Jodi Ernst <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/22/joni-ernst-guns_n_6032164.html" type="external">proclaimed</a> that she had a right to defend herself and her family “from the government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important.” During his campaign for the presidential nomination, Texas Republican Ted Cruz <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/ted-cruz-second-amendment-government-tyranny" type="external">asserted</a> that the Second Amendment provides “a Constitutional right to protect your children, your family, your home, our lives, and to serve as the ultimate check against governmental tyranny—for the protection of liberty.” And of course, in August, <a type="internal">Donald Trump implied</a> that “Second Amendment people” might murder Hillary Clinton should she appoint liberal Supreme Court justices.</p> <p>Given the GOP’s embrace of the insurrectionist theory, Walsh’s statement should not be at all shocking. In a follow-up tweet, he <a href="https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/791382994783133696" type="external">clarified</a> that he was encouraging “protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back.” Under his party’s view of the Second Amendment, “doing what it takes to get our country back” includes assassinating political leaders whom one deems to be oppressive. Oppression, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. And the GOP has already primed its supporters to fight back against whatever oppression Hillary Clinton might bring—muskets at the ready.</p></article>
	<article id="0000647" published-at="2016-10-30" title="Review of 650,000 Emails in Weiner’s Laptop for Potential Clinton Ties Could Take Weeks"><p>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p> Hillary Clinton speaks during a campaign rally at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park on October 26, 2016 in Tampa, Florida. <p>The FBI is getting ready to analyze around 650,000 emails that are in the laptop of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner to see whether any of them have any relation to a previous investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server. “Metadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the Democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state,” <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/laptop-may-include-thousands-of-emails-linked-to-hillary-clintons-private-server-1477854957/" type="external">reports the Wall Street Journal</a>, citing “people familiar with the matter.”</p> <p>The probe, which was apparently delayed because agents had to wait for a court order, is expected to take weeks at least. That means that if Clinton wins the election, she will be celebrating with a cloud over her head as the FBI will at least be investigating some of her closest advisers.</p> <p>The warrant to begin searching the emails has been obtained, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/us/politics/justice-department-warrant-clinton-abedin-fbi.html" type="external">the New York Times reports</a>. “The process has begun,” a federal law enforcement official said. But the Times notes that law enforcement officials have said “there was no chance the email review could be completed before Election Day.”</p> <p>Clinton’s campaign did not wait long to blast the Wall Street Journal story, highlighting that it says the emails “may” be related to the previous investigation into the private server. “These are misleading leaks from the FBI and its shameless,” <a href="https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/792811536716820480" type="external">Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon wrote on Twitter</a>. Indeed, the Journal piece notes that first investigators have to determine whether any of the emails are between Clinton aide Huma Abedin, Weiner’s estranged wife, and State Department officials, then whether they contain classified material, and then whether any of them are duplicates of emails that have already been reviewed.</p> <p>It seems to be increasingly clear that while FBI Director James Comey only learned about the existence of these potentially relevant emails recently, investigators knew for weeks, according to several reports. That is significant because if the news had been revealed earlier it “might have been less politicall damaging for Clinton,” notes the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-agents-knew-of-clinton-related-emails-weeks-before-director-was-briefed/2016/10/30/657ed266-9eb1-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_clintonfbi-121pm%3Ahomepage%2Fs" type="external">Washington Post</a>, which also points out that it isn’t clear “what agents have been doing in the intervening time.”</p> <p>Abedin, meanwhile, is a bit at a loss as to how her emails would have ended up in Weiner’s computer, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/clinton-aide-huma-abedin-has-told-people-she-doesnt-know-how-her-emails-wound-up-on-her-husbands-computer/2016/10/29/1d30c2b8-9e15-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_c" type="external">according to the Post</a>. Abedin didn’t regularly use that computer and apparently her lawyers never even searched through it because they didn’t think any messages coud be in there. An investigator tells <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CAMPAIGN_2016_CLINTON_EMAIL?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-10-30-15-27-44" type="external">the Associated Press</a> that it was "news to [Abedin]" that her emails would be in her husband's computer.</p></article>
	<article id="0000648" published-at="2016-09-30" title="Trump’s Astounding, Hypocritical Cruelty Peaks With Alicia Machado “Sex Tape” Tweet"><p>Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</p> Childish, mean-spirited bully Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Bedford, New Hampshire, on September 29, 2016. <p>Donald Trump has the biggest platform of any out-of-control bully in the world right now. This week, he’s using it to try and destroy former Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado, who’s spoken out about how <a type="internal">Trump mistreated and humiliated her</a> when she gained weight after winning the crown.</p> <p>Trump has been ranting nonstop about Machado since Hillary Clinton <a type="internal">brought her up in Monday’s presidential debate</a>. (Afterward, her campaign released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8ZM58O_gBo" type="external">a Spanish-language video</a> of Machado telling her story.) She did gain a lot of weight, he whined, and that’s a “ <a type="internal">real problem</a>”! He hinted to the media and his Twitter audience that Machado had some kind of checkered past that would scandalize us. Finally, awake and fuming in the wee hours of Friday morning, Trump couldn’t take it anymore. In a 5:30 a.m. tweet, he beseeched America to “ <a type="internal">check out sex tape</a>.”</p> <p>The alleged “sex tape” is not a sex tape at all. It’s a night-vision clip from La Granja, a Spanish Big Brother–esque reality program, that appears to show Machado having sex with a man. The clip, from 2005, shows no nudity; both Machado and her partner are covered by sheets. It’s similar to a hundred scenes that have aired on Big Brother, Jersey Shore, or The Real World.</p> <p>Though the clip has been available for a decade, it’s safe to say that few people knew or cared about it until the Trump campaign thrust it into the political news cycle. Today, the world is dissecting it. The abject cruelty and cynicism of this move is staggering. Machado isn’t running for political office; there’s no reason for Trump to attack her for something unrelated to her claims against him. He’s trying to besmirch her character as if it were relevant, as if she were his opponent. Her appearance on a sexy reality show has no bearing on her Miss Universe story, yet he’s acting as if this video clip invalidates it. Hillary did not present her as an “angel” or “paragon of virtue,” as Trump tweeted. She presented Machado as a regular woman who was bullied mercilessly by an entitled, insecure man who gets off on putting women down. One need not be “ <a type="internal">Mother Teresa</a>” to deserve better than Trump’s abuse.</p> <p>Having sex on a reality show is nothing to be ashamed about. But Trump’s use of this clip as a weapon against her character—her reliability, her capacity to inspire sympathy, her deserving of kind treatment—is callous and low. It’s also extraordinarily hypocritical. Trump is <a type="internal">forever bragging</a> about the hotness of his own wives and sexual conquests, and he’s <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/07/30/melania-trump-like-youve-never-seen-her-before/" type="external">applauded Melania’s success as a model</a> when confronted with her own nude photo shoots. He’s <a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/6456/trump-paris-hilton-was-hot-12-i-watched-her-sex-hank-berrien" type="external">watched Paris Hilton’s sex tape</a> and commended her for being jaw-droppingly hot at age 12. He proudly <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/proud-adulterer-blames-woman-for-not-stopping-husbands-adultery" type="external">recalls his own adultery</a> while telling us that Machado’s sex is something to shame—“disgusting,” he called her in his tweet.</p> <p>Machado, all power to her, is taking Trump’s infantile harassment in stride. In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BK-7u7Oj3L0/" type="external">an Instagram post</a> on Friday morning, she scolded him for his attacks. “In the middle of his campaign of hate, the Republican candidate insists on discrediting and demoralizing a woman, that is definitely one of his most frightening characteristics,” she wrote in Spanish. “With this, he’s looking to distract the attention from his real problems and from his inability to pretend to be the leader of this great nation.” She goes on to reaffirm her support for Clinton and promise to continue speaking out for women and Latinos. Like Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Muslim American couple who endured <a type="internal">a similar round of senseless public abuse</a> at Trump’s hands, Machado is giving Trump and his team a basic lesson in decency and political PR.</p> <p>Trump’s capacity for no-holds-barred shaming of anyone and everyone should give voters cause for deep concern. Even worse, perhaps, is the fact that he can’t stop himself from bullying people even when it’s not in his political interest. His feuds with the Khans and Machado make him look like a cartoonish mob boss seeking sadistic revenge on anyone with less political power than he has. Trump cannot stop punching down until he’s launched every low blow he can dream up. As Clinton tweeted on Friday morning, that’s simply not an appropriate disposition for a president.</p> <q> <p>What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?</p>— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/781869512983515136" type="external">September 30, 2016</a> </q> <q> <p>When something gets under Donald's thin skin, he lashes out and can't let go. This is dangerous for a president.</p>— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/781870635324694528" type="external">September 30, 2016</a> </q> <q> <p>Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell—an accomplished actor. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight—when she was pregnant. Pathetic.</p>— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/781872597969534976" type="external">September 30, 2016</a> </q> <p>In previous elections, Trump’s brand of mean-spirited smears might have been outsourced to shady PACs and third-level surrogates, leaving the candidate to rise above the messy fracas. Surely, that’s what the GOP would prefer. But party leaders only have themselves to blame for the anger, conspiracy theories, and racist panic that’s led to Trump’s rise; they deserve whatever bad press Trump earns for them with his extended temper tantrum. Alicia Machado does not.</p></article>
	<article id="0000649" published-at="2017-10-20" title="Max Boot: Republicans have Stockholm Syndrome and it’s getting worse">
President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Governor Ricardo Rossello of Puerto Rico in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) <p>The lobotomization of the Republican Party appeared complete last year when the same GOP paladins who had denounced Donald Trump as a “lunatic trying to get ahold of nuclear weapons” (Marco Rubio), as a bigot who was guilty of “the textbook definition of a racist comment” (Paul Ryan), and as a “narcissist,” “serial philanderer,” “pathological liar,” and “bully” (Ted Cruz) nevertheless endorsed him for the most powerful position in the world.</p> <p>Tragedy turned to farce (or is it the other way around?) after the emergence of the “grab ‘em by the pussy” tape on October 7, 2016. Republicans such as Sens. John Thune, Mike Crapo and Deb Fischer called for Trump to leave the race on the grounds that he was unfit for office, only to change their minds and re-endorse him when it became evident that he was still polling strongly among base voters.</p> <p>But the Republicans’ race to the bottom — to the absolute lowest moral and intellectual depths — wasn’t over last year, and it’s not over now. It’s still continuing, with even supposedly “normal,” “moderate,” “mainstream” Republicans increasingly echoing Trump’s know-nothing effusions.</p> <p>In Virginia, Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman and counselor to “compassionate conservative” George W. Bush, is attacking his Democratic opponent for governor, Ralph Northam, for being too sympathetic to immigrants and too unsympathetic to Confederate monuments. One particularly incendiary commercial accuses Northam of “increasing the threat of MS-13,” a drug gang from El Salvador that is evoked with pictures of tattooed gang-bangers who actually belong to a rival outfit.</p> <p>Gillespie’s tendentious reasoning? Northam voted against a bill in Congress that would have prohibited the establishment of any “sanctuary cities,” even though Virginia does not have any such cities. MS-13 has long been a favorite Trump target, symbolizing the supposed menace of Latino immigration.</p> <p>The current chair of the RNC, Ronna Romney McDaniel, has been equally eager to serve as a Trump echo chamber. Her Twitter feed gives sycophancy a bad name. Recent tweets: “No one recognizes the importance of women’s empowerment better than @IvankaTrump. She’s paving the way worldwide”; “Wonderful to finally have a @POTUS who isn’t ashamed to stand up for religious liberties”; and “Ratings for unpatriotic NFL declining? Shocked.” If Trump claimed the moon was made of Swiss cheese, McDaniel would be mocking anyone who said it was actually Camembert.</p> <p>In her willingness to serve as a Trump enabler, McDaniel is matched, and perhaps exceeded, by the senior-most Republican officials in the land. Who can forget Vice President Mike Pence going to the Colts-49ers game on Oct. 8 for the express purpose of walking out to express disapproval of players kneeling during the national anthem? Trump has fixated on this non-issue as a way to mobilize his white, working-class base by anathematizing wealthy African-American athletes. And Pence is happy to play along. Just as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is happy to vouch for Trump as a non-racist despite decades of Archie Bunker-style comments suggesting otherwise. “His heart’s in the right place,” Ryan said, making one wonder whether he has access to a super-secret EKG.</p> <p>The leaders of Congress seem to be suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, which by now should really be renamed Republican Syndrome. There, on Monday, was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell singing kumbaya with Trump in the White House Rose Garden only hours after the president disavowed any blame for “not getting the job done” legislatively. “I’m not gong to blame myself, I’ll be honest,” Trump said. (When has he ever blamed himself for anything?) “They’re not getting the job done.” In case there is any doubt about who “they” is, Trump has been explicit in calling out McConnell as a weak leader, tweeting in August, “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal &amp;amp; Replace for 7 years, he failed!” McConnell nevertheless pledged fealty to his abuser. “Contrary to what some of you may have reported,” he dutifully intoned, “we are together totally on this agenda to move America forward.”</p> <p>The excuse for this craven behavior is that all qualms about Trump - the least presidential president in the whole history of this republic, or any other - must be subordinated to the Republican policy agenda. You know, the agenda that Trump is not actually passing.</p> <p>This GOP attitude was taken to its logical if laughable extreme when Sen. Rob Portman, another supposed Republican adult, was asked about the victory in Alabama’s Senate special election primary of far-right rabble-rouser Roy Moore, who makes Trump seem wonkish by comparison. Portman’s only response? “He’s going to be for tax reform, I think.” Never mind about the Constitution, which Moore and Trump both seek to shred in their own ways — Moore is opposed to the separation of church and state, Trump to the freedom of the press. (He thinks that “it is frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write.”) As long as they’re for tax cuts, we’re all good!</p> <p>There are, to be sure, a few honorable exceptions — prominent Republicans who are willing to speak the truth about the naked emperor — but they are a miniscule minority in a nation in which their party dominates every branch of government.</p> <p>One of the most prominent truth-tellers is Sen. John McCain, who voted against the abomination that Republican leaders slapped together at the last minute to make good on Trump’s pledge to “repeal and replace” ObamaCare. Receiving the Liberty Medal at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, McCain gave a typically courageous, clear-eyed speech Monday in which he denounced Trumpism root and branch.</p> <p>“To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century,” he said, “to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘the last best hope of earth’ for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.” But then McCain has long been a “maverick” distrusted by the same rank-and-file Republicans who now eagerly embrace Trump, his opposite in every respect.</p> <p>McCain’s fellow senator from Arizona, Jeff Flake, also has been outspoken in denouncing Trump. “We pretended the emperor wasn’t naked,” he wrote in his recent book, Conscience of a Conservative. “Even worse: We checked our critical faculties at the door and pretended that the emperor was making sense.” Flake’s reward for his truth-telling? He is in danger of losing next year’s primary to the odious Kelli Ward, an overly eager office-seeker who, following McCain’s diagnosis of brain cancer this summer, immediately called on him to quit the Senate so that the governor could appoint her in his place. Civilized conduct is not only unnecessary in today’s GOP, it is actually distrusted as the sign of a “RINO (Republican in Name Only) cuck.”</p> <p>Sen. Bob Corker, one of Trump’s initial establishment enablers, has recently taken to telling the truth about the president, but only because he has decided not to seek re-election. The reaction to Corker’s comments — he said that Trump is treating the presidency like a “reality show,” that his aides are desperately trying to “contain him,” and that he is setting us on “the path to World War III” — has been telling. Other Republicans aren’t stepping forward to disagree, and Corker says that virtually all of his fellow Republican senators agree with him. But instead of saying in public what they say in private, these invertebrate officeholders try to change the subject or simply refuse to comment.</p> <p>They are a profile in cowardice, these Republicans, and they are making a mockery of their oaths to “support and defend the Constitution.” If they truly believe that Trump is not fit for office, then they have an obligation to impeach and remove him. Instead they choose to act as if Trump is their partner in governing. In the process, the entire Republican Party is making itself ever-more complicit in Trump’s crimes — which range from offenses against good sense, rationality and common decency to, perhaps, actual violations of the law such as obstruction of justice.</p> <p>It becomes ever harder to disagree with the verdict of foreign-policy sage Robert Kagan, like me an erstwhile Republican, who writes that the GOP in its current form is doomed and that Republicans who cannot stomach Trumpism “should change their registration and start voting for Democratic moderates and centrists, as some Republicans did in Virginia recently, to give them a leg up in their fight against the party’s left wing.”</p> <p>This is truly Trump’s party, and that leaves me to root for Democrats to win a landslide victory in the midterm elections next fall. I have my differences with many Democratic candidates, but on the most important issue facing our nation — whether Trump is fit for office — they are right and Republicans are a disgrace.</p> More Stories</article>

	<article id="0000651" published-at="2017-08-14" title="GOP must denounce Trump for embrace of white supremacists"><p>Donald Trump has dropped all pretense and proudly raised the banner of white racial grievance. The time has come for Republicans in Congress to decide whether this is what they signed up for.</p> <p>Business leaders decided that they'd had enough, quitting two presidential advisory councils before Trump quickly dissolved the panels. Military leaders made their call as well, issuing statements – in the wake of Charlottesville – making clear they embrace diversity and reject bigotry.</p> <p>With only a few exceptions, however, GOP political leaders have been too timid to denounce the president and the reprehensible game of racial politics he's playing. I think the corporate chief executives who bailed are making the right bet: History will remember who spoke out, who was complicit, and who stood idly by.</p> <a href="http://stlamerican.com/tncms/tracking/bannerad/clicks/?i=ros/fixed-big-ad-top-asset1/b512cd42-9670-11e8-b0ee-ef96f526b04f&amp;r=https://www.myprovidencebank.com/lending/mortgage-center/mortgage-loans.html" type="external"/> 300x250 image ad <p>On Twitter (where else?) Trump poured salt in the nation's wounds by coming out firmly against the removal of public monuments to the Confederacy – the issue that brought white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to Charlottesville and led to the death of Heather Heyer.</p> <p>"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments," he wrote. "You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson – who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!"</p> <p>Trump can't possibly be so dense that he doesn't see a clear distinction between the men who founded this nation and those who tried to rip it apart.</p> <p>Trump may indeed not know that most of those Confederate monuments were erected not in the years right after the Civil War but around the turn of the 20th century, when the Jim Crow system of state-enforced racial oppression was being established. They symbolize not history but the defiance of history; they celebrate not defeat on the battlefield but victory in putting uppity African Americans back in their place.</p> <p>For Trump, the important thing is to tell the white voters who constitute his base that they are being disrespected and dispossessed. It's a cynical and dangerous ploy.</p> <p>We know this is Trump's game because White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon told us so. In an interview with journalist Robert Kuttner of The American Prospect, Bannon is quoted as saying: "The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats."</p> <p>But Trump's base won't identify with Nazis and the KKK. That's why Trump maintained – falsely – that among the torch-bearing Charlottesville white supremacists there were also plenty of "nice people."</p> <p>That's probably also why Bannon, in the interview with Kuttner, referred to the white-power clowns as, well, "clowns." He's smart enough to reassure Trump supporters that they're not like those racists and that all the racial game-playing is on the other side.</p> <p>Trump's desperation is palpable. His approval ratings have slid perilously close to the danger zone where Republican officeholders no longer fear crossing him.</p> <p>For titans of the business community, the chief executives of such companies as General Electric, Campbell Soup, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and 3M decided they could no longer serve on Trump's advisory Manufacturing Council or his Strategy &amp;amp; Policy Forum.</p> <p>Prospects that Trump can actually follow through on a business-friendly agenda, including tax reform, look increasingly dim.

There’s Only One Problem…"><p>Photos of detained illegal immigrants in cage-like cells went viral this weekend. Liberals were all too quick to spread this shocking photograph, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.</p> <p>Is there nothing the left won’t do to slander President Donald Trump? The answer, of course, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being as underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible. Also, being as dishonest as a snake.</p> <p>Over the course of Trump’s time in office, we’ve seen liberals do some shockingly terrible things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, country of origin, and even her accent, proving who the real racists and sexists are.</p> <p>They’ve attacked Trump’s family, including his young son. Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s mental health, even calling Barron handicapped. That’s not even mentioning the numerous times that left-wing outlets edited videos or photos to make Trump look like a bad guy.</p> <p>But what they did this weekend really takes the cake. A photo went viral across Twitter. The ugly picture depicted detained illegal immigrants. These people — arrested by our government — were forced to stay in cages resembling dog kennels. Liberals, as you can imagine, were beside themselves, attacking Trump for an obvious act of cruelty and evil.</p> <p>It’s too bad that these liberals didn’t bother to check the date on the picture.</p> <q> <p>Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted tweet, linked to an AZCentral.com article titled, “First glimpse of immigrant children at holding facility” and said “This is happening right now, and the only debate that matter is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.”</p> <p>His obvious intent was to slam the Trump administration for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border.

I mean, who could allow something as evil as this:</p> Screenshot of Favreau’s now-deleted tweet. <p>Liberals across the spectrum of stupid chimed in with their condemnations of President Donald Trump.</p> <q> <p>This makes me sad and angry. <a href="https://t.co/WM1m57iR8x" type="external">https://t.co/WM1m57iR8x</a></p> <p>— Paolo Uggetti (@PaoloUggetti) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaoloUggetti/status/1000797414431735808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">May 27, 2018</a></p> </q> <q> <p>I saw this photo floating around and didn’t know if it was real.</p> <p>It is.</p> <p>Children of immigrants are being held in cages, like dogs, at ICE detention centers, sleeping on the floor.

What vicious, vile cruelty against innocent illegals. Surely the man responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.</p> <p>But wait, let’s look at the original article. It was from ACCentral.com. According to the date, this was written in 2014.</p> That’s right, liberals. This photograph you’re all so outraged over was taken during Obama’s administration. <p>This “bombshell” story came out four years ago. Yet, for some reason, nobody was outraged. Liberals weren’t storming Twitter with demands for change. They weren’t calling Obama racist for treating children like this. Why weren’t the overlords within the mainstream media demanding answers from his administration?</p> <p>Seems like liberals didn’t really care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they daily accuse Trump of racism, based on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism. He’s not treating illegals like animals. But while Trump calls vile MS-13 members “animals,” Obama was treating children like animals. Really makes you think.</p> <p>Liberals, in their feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed one of Obama’s many sins. And their own. You see, they don’t give a damn about illegal immigrants. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration. Before Trump proposed the wall, liberals didn’t think twice about illegals. We know that for a fact because this article has been around for FOUR YEARS, and they’ve said nothing.</p> <p>They dishonestly tried to pass this off as current, only for it to blow up in their faces. Any response liberals? Are you going to denounce the absolute evil committed under Obama’s watch?</p> <p>Source: <a href="https://madworldnews.com/liberals-illegals-cages-problem/" type="external">madworldnews.com</a></p></article>

Bill Kristol and Sean Hannity CreativeCommonsFlickr/GageSkidmore andLeonardZhukovsky/Shutterstock&amp;gt; <p><a href="" type="external">Every time I listen to Sean Hannity or some other Trump-enthusiast stressing the “mission” for which our president was elected, I hear flattering references to “the people.” Mind you, I’m not against populist tropes being used to execute an end-run around the likes of Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi. Moreover, I’ve never pretended to be a “Never-Trump” establishment Republican. My endorsement of Trump during last year’s presidential campaign is too much a matter of record to be credibly denied. But the endless appeals to “the people” have begun to wear on me.</a></p> <p><a href="" type="external">Trump’s core constituency covers about 39 percent of prospective voters; and this raises certain questions about whether this percentage is coextensive with the entire “people.” Do the</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-chilling-study-shows-how-hostile-college-students-are-toward-free-speech/2017/09/18/cbb1a234-9ca8-11e7-9083-fbfddf6804c2_story.html?utm_term=.f64ae8681655" type="external">4 out of 10 college students</a> who would silence “hate speech” (that is speech from the Right) belong to “the people”? Do <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/americans-donald-trump-wrong-criticize/2017/09/29/id/816758/" type="external">the 60 percent of those polled</a> in a recent CNN survey who disapprove of Trump’s criticism of NFL players who took to their knees during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner, belong to this mystical whole known as “the people”? What about the more than 60 million individuals who gave their votes to Clinton in our most recent presidential election? Do these voters belong to “the people”? If not, why not?</p> <p>I’m asking these questions because I’d like to know how 39 percent of the voting public can become all of “the people.” I asked myself a similar question as I read The Revolt of the Elites by Christopher Lasch— <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Revolt-of-the-Elites-and-the-Betrayal-of-Democracy/" type="external">a work</a> that tries to dissociate “the people” from the vile, transnational “overclass” that Lasch blames for the decline of the family and a traditional sense of community. Lasch studiously ignores a major reason that the entertainers, authors, and other celebrities whom he deprecates have done so remarkably well. It’s because “the people” adore them and their cultural products and have made them what they are. Without Lasch’s “people,” the overclass that he despises would not be prospering.</p> <p>Non-leftist populists have certain groups in mind when they use their conjuring term, just as Democrats do when they refer to grievance-bearing lifestyle and racial minorities as “the people.” Lasch, a defender of settled communities, typically holds up as his paradigm a mid-twentieth century working-class family, featuring very traditional gender roles. Lasch’s ideal mommy packs a lunch pail for his ideal blue-collar dad, who goes off to work in a factory. This is also the image of the populist family that comes to mind when Pat Buchanan tells us about the declining rustbelt and about all of the jobs that have fled from our blue-collar communities to Third World countries. Unlike Buchanan—who is linked to the Old Right—Lasch was considered to be a part of the socialist Left during his lifetime. And yet, the two figures are rhetorically and often programmatically indistinguishable. Both would now exemplify a populism of the Right, combining demands for the protection of the indigenous workforce with fond images of a disappearing America. Since I can easily identify with these images, I am noting this regretfully.</p> <p>By contrast, most of those who I hear celebrating Trumpian populism—like Sean Hannity and Newt Gingrich on Fox News—are not about to restore “the people” as they used to be, or at least how they were perceived to be. After all, cohesive societies with traditional gender and family roles that right-wing populists once took for granted are now much weaker than they once were. The last thing that our would-be populists would want to do is face the rage of LGBT and feminist activists on the social Left, and the unavoidable media outrage. Our self-advertised populists do not therefore attempt to take us back to mid-twentieth century communities, lest they be accused of praising the bad old times. In any case, Trumpian populists have different priorities. For example, Hannity and other pundits on Fox News want to mobilize their viewers against the Democrats and in favor of Republican political candidates. Although they occasionally criticize the GOP for not being up to speed, they then go on to hammer the Democrats for not caring about “the people.” We are urged to help “our president” <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/07/14/sean-hannity-monologue-democrats-mainstream-media-colluding-destroy-trump" type="external">fulfill the people’s will</a> by voting for Republicans at every level.</p> <p>Reading Breitbart, one gets the impression that their staff’s understanding of populism is simply to support Trump at every turn, except when Steve Bannon decides to break ranks (such as on DACA). Other Trumpian populist websites, such as American Greatness and a more <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/about/" type="external">recent arrival</a>, American Affairs, often look like what one might expect to find on other websites bearing a conservative label. Both feature conventional neoconservative names on their mastheads, but they also showcase representatives of a West Coast movement descended derivatively from the German political theorist Leo Strauss.</p> <p><a href="https://amgreatness.com/2017/04/08/rod-dreher-meet-leo-strauss-friends/" type="external">These would-be populists were disciples of Strauss’s student, the late Harry Jaffa</a>, or in some cases of Jaffa’s student Charles Kesler at Claremont University, and are promoting their trademark views about the United States as a propositional nation founded on natural rights theory. Jaffa combined his view of America’s founding with obligatory worship of certain democratic statesmen and heroes, including Lincoln, Churchill, and Martin Luther King Jr. For more than 50 years, “West Coast Straussians” have been feuding with more mainstream Straussians, who are centered mostly in Chicago or else on the East Coast. Not surprisingly, <a href="https://leostrausscenter.uchicago.edu/interviews" type="external">this second group of sectarians</a> has come to be known as “East Coast Straussians.”</p> <p>Since the latter are closely tied to Bill Kristol and became almost uniformly Never-Trumpers, their rivals predictably jumped onto the Trump-train. They thereupon set up websites that imbued populist rhetoric. This, of course, is something that neither Kristol nor his East Coast Straussian friends—who seem ecstatically happy with Washington and the Deep State—would ever attempt. To their credit, West Coast Straussian websites often post commentaries on legal and judicial matters that elicit my total agreement. I would be delighted if these websites simply stated some of their signature positions, such as criticizing judicial activism, without claiming to represent an entity called “the people.”</p> <p>All that seems left of populism, a movement that arose in late 19th century America among rural and small-town populations, are a political style and distrust of elites. Unlike those who today appropriate this identity, American populists historically desired to return all domestic politics to the states and to create public utilities. Needless to say, I’m not hearing today’s so-called populists calling for either. It is entirely possible to criticize the centralized administrative state, crony capitalism, and the coercive imposition of Political Correctness without claiming (anachronistically) to be a populist. And one can and should engage in such criticism without pretending counterfactually to be speaking for “the people.”</p> <p>Paul Gottfried is Raffensperger Professor of Humanities Emeritus at Elizabethtown College, where he taught for twenty-five years.

If a similar number of Americans on the mainland were without food and potable water for this long, it would be treated as a major scandal and it would be the top story in the news every day. Because it is happening in a territory with no political clout, it is not being taken as seriously as it should be. While the president repeatedly congratulates himself on what a great job he imagines he has done, the federal response to the disaster in Puerto Rico has been unacceptably poor. In terms of providing the most basic necessities in the wake of a major disaster, the government is failing millions of its citizens.</p> </q> <p>Where are Donald Trump’s court Evangelicals on this?

	<article id="0000658" published-at="2016-05-23" title="End the Imperial Presidency Before It's Too Late">
Jim Urquhart / Reuters <p>Wake up, establishment centrists: Donald Trump is coming!</p> <p>After the Vietnam War and Watergate and the spying scandals uncovered by the Church Committee and the Nixon Administration cronies who nearly firebombed the Brookings Institution, Americans were briefly inclined to rein in executive power—a rebuke to Richard Nixon’s claim that “if the president does it, that means it’s not illegal.” Powerful committees were created to oversee misconduct-prone spy agencies. The War Powers Resolution revived a legislative check on warmaking. “In 34 years,” Vice President Dick Cheney would lament to ABC News in a January 2002 interview, “I have repeatedly seen an erosion of the powers and the ability of the president of the United States to do his job. I feel an obligation... to pass on our offices in better shape than we found them to our successors."</p> <p>The Bush Administration aggressively moved to expand executive power, drawing on the dubious legal maneuvering of David Addington, John Yoo, and their enablers. Starting in 2005, the junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, would repeatedly insist that Bush’s assertions of executive power violated the Constitution. Nonetheless, Obama inherited a newly powerful executive branch, just as Cheney had hoped. And rather than dismantle it, Obama spent two terms lending the imprimatur of centrist, establishment bipartisanship to Cheney’s vision.</p> <p>Now, Donald Trump is coming.</p> <p>Civil libertarians have long warned the partisans who trusted Bush and Obama, and the establishment centrists who couldn’t imagine anyone in the White House besides an Al Gore or John Kerry or John McCain or Mitt Romney, that they were underestimating both the seriousness of civil liberties abuses under Bush and Obama and the likelihood of even less responsible leaders wreaking havoc in the White House.</p> <p>Three years ago, in “ <a type="internal">All the Infrastructure a Tyrant Would Need, Courtesy of Bush and Obama</a>,” I warned that “more and more, we're counting on having angels in office and making ourselves vulnerable to devils,” and that come January, 2017, an unknown person would enter the Oval Office and inherit all of these precedents:</p> The president can order American citizens killed in secret. The president can detain prisoners indefinitely without charges or trial. The president can order drone strikes at will in countries against which no war has been declared. The president can start a torture program with impunity. The president can conduct warrantless surveillance on tens of millions of Americans. <p>Now, Donald Trump is coming. And many establishment centrists are professing alarm. There is nothing more establishment than Robert Kagan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, writing an op-ed in the Washington Post. He begins by observing that if Trump wins, his coalition will include tens of millions of Americans.</p> <p>“Imagine the power he would wield then,” Kagan <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-is-how-fascism-comes-to-america/2016/05/17/c4e32c58-1c47-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html" type="external">wrote</a>. “In addition to all that comes from being the leader of a mass following, he would also have the immense powers of the American presidency at his command: the Justice Department, the FBI, the intelligence services, the military. Who would dare to oppose him then? Certainly not a Republican Party that laid down before him even when he was comparatively weak. Is a man like Trump, with infinitely greater power in his hands, likely to become more humble, more judicious, more generous, less vengeful than he is today, than he has been his whole life? Does vast power un-corrupt?”</p> <p>Kagan’s article seemed well-received among establishment centrists.</p> <p>Yet neither he nor most others who share his fears have yet acknowledged their bygone failures of imagination, or granted that civil libertarians were right: The establishment has permitted the American presidency to get dangerously powerful.</p> <p>While writing or sharing articles that compare Trump to Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco, few if any have called on Obama or Congress to act now “ <a type="internal">to tyrant-proof the White House</a>.” However much they fear Trump, however rhetorically maximalist their warnings, even the prospect of him controlling the national security state does not cause them to renounce their reckless embrace of “ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cult-Presidency-Americas-Dangerous-Executive/dp/1933995157" type="external">The Cult of the Presidency</a>,” a centrist religion that persisted across the Bush administration’s torture chambers and the Obama administration’s unlawful War in Libya.</p> <p>With a reality-TV bully on the doorstep of the White House, still they hesitate to urge reform to a branch of government they’ve long regarded as more than co-equal.</p> <p>Their inaction is irresponsible.</p> <p>Just as the conservative movement is duty bound to grapple with its role in a populist demagogue seizing control of the GOP, establishment centrists ought to grapple with the implicit blessing they’ve given to the extraordinary powers Trump would inherit, and that even the less-risky choice, Hillary Clinton, would abuse.</p> <p>The exercise would prove uncomfortable. The establishment centrists who oppose Trump worry, as they should, that he will violate the civil liberties of Muslim Americans, yet few spoke up when Michael Bloomberg presided over a secret program that profiled and spied on Muslim American students, generating zero counterterrorism leads.</p> <p>The establishment centrists who denounced Edward Snowden would have to admit that, if Trump is half as bad as they fear, Americans will be better served knowing the scope and capabilities of NSA surveillance than living in ignorance of it. Some will be forced to admit to themselves that they hope the military remains sprinkled with whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning to speak out against serious abuses.</p> <p>For 16 years or more, establishment centrists have been complicit in a historically reckless trend. Come 2017, it may place Donald Trump at a big table, much like the one on The Apprentice, where he’ll decide not which B-list celebrity to fire, but which humans to kill. Establishment centrists could work to strip the presidency of that power.</p> <p>Instead they do nothing.</p> <p>We want to hear what you think about this article. <a type="internal">Submit a letter</a> to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.</p></article>

Image source: TheBlaze <p>FBI special agent Aaron Rouse, the chief of the FBI’s Las Vegas office, revealed Wednesday that the agency might not be able to reveal Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock’s motive until October.</p> What did agent Rouse say? <p>Rouse, who spoke to the <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/fbi-chief-says-report-on-las-vegas-shooting-expected-by-anniversary/" type="external">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a>, said that the report should be finalized by the massacre’s anniversary date.</p> <p>“Now that’s a long time for some people, but speaking for the FBI, that’s light speed, all right?” Rouse said. “And again, it will be thorough.”</p> <p>“[The FBI’s report] is focusing a large part on the why, OK? Which is what everybody wants to know,” Rouse reported.</p> <p>He added that through a thorough investigation of the incident, including those whom the FBI interviewed — upward of 400 people who had even the smallest connection with Paddock, according to the Review-Journal — he is confident that a comprehensive report will be released by October.</p> <p>“I’ve said this before: I believe at the end of this investigation we will have as many answers as we possibly can without talking to the subject themselves,” Rouse explained. “I am comfortable — underline comfortable — with the pace of the investigation, with the quality of the investigation, with the thoroughness of the investigation. We will have as many answers as we can possibly provide.”</p> What do they know about Paddock and the days leading up to the shooting? <p>Rouse added that he doesn’t believe Paddock committed the atrocity with any particular ideology or affiliation in mind, and he stood by the belief that Paddock acted alone in the shooting.</p> <p>“I believe that there is one person and one person alone to blame for what happened on One October, and that is Stephen Paddock,” Rouse added.</p> <p>Rouse later admitted that no one saw the shooting coming.</p> <p>“I think that that’s important for people to realize,” he said.</p> What’s the history? <p>Las Vegas gunman <a type="internal">Stephen Paddock</a> shot 58 concertgoers at <a type="internal">the Route 91 Harvest country music</a> festival in October.

	<article id="0000666" published-at="2016-03-05" title="Louis CK Pens Scathing Anti-Trump Letter: Trump ‘Is Hitler’ and ‘We Are Being Germany in the 30s’">
Reuters <p>There’s no doubt that Donald Trump, the GOP’s presidential frontrunner, is great for TV ratings. CBS Chairman Les Moonves recently remarked, “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” He’s an animated character—orange, cotton candy hair, tiny hands, dictatorial posture—like a cross between Mussolini, whose philosophy he <a href="http://gawker.com/how-we-fooled-donald-trump-into-retweeting-benito-musso-1761795039" type="external">seems to enjoy</a>, and a particularly irascible Oompa Loompa. But underneath all the doth protest too much <a type="internal">penis defenses</a> and delayed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/02/opinions/donald-trump-kkk-game-jones/" type="external">Ku Klux Klan repudiations</a> is a sinister despot who will stop at nothing to gain power—this according to acclaimed comedian Louis CK, the latest celebrity to speak out against the populist, hate-filled rise of Trump. In his weekly email blast to fans, CK compared Trump to Hitler, calling him an “insane bigot” and “dangerous” while calling upon conservatives to not vote for Trump, but instead cast their vote someone more moderate, like John Kasich. And if you think CK is a typical left-wing Hollywood-type, he attempted to put that notion to bed as well, writing, “I’m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance.”</p> <p>CK’s politics have always been fairly nebulous and hard to pin down. Speaking <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/01/16/404790/louis-ck-on-his-political-philosophy-and-the-value-of-curiosity/" type="external">to ThinkProgress</a> in 2012, he expanded on his political views a bit:</p> <p>“I don’t have any political opinions, I just am very curious,” he said. “And it’s very interesting to listen to what people say. What’s the best way to run a country and the world? Those are really profound questions. I don’t have the confidence to say that I know one way or another. Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I’m very suspicious. It doesn’t make sense to me that you’d have the same solution to every issue. I just like listening. I try to take people who are way far away from what I think or understand and put a representative of them on my show. I like to try to learn form them.”</p> <p>And years ago, well before Trump ran for president, CK told a story to a radio station about how he once rode the elevator with Trump at Trump’s Castle (now the Golden Nugget)—his sprawling casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. “[Trump] just looked miserable,” said CK. “He looked so unhappy. And all that money, I realized he has all these billions of dollars, but he’s fuckin’ miserable because he needs $100 billion to look in the mirror and not want to kill himself.”</p> <p>Well, Louis CK has apparently learned all he has to from candidate Trump. The anti-Trump screed came at the end of CK’s email newsletter touting his new show Horace and Pete—a very long, very pointed postscript. You can read it here:</p> <p>P.S. Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.</p> <p>And I’m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren’t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time.</p> <p>Trump is not that. He's an insane bigot. He is dangerous.</p> <p>He already said he would expand libel laws to sue anyone who "writes a negative hit piece" about him. He says "I would open up the libel laws so we can sue them and win lots of money. Not like now. These guys are totally protected." He said that. He has promised to decimate the first amendment. (If you think he’s going to keep the second amendment intact you’re delusional.) And he said that Paul Ryan, speaker of the house will "pay" for criticizing him. So I'm saying this now because if he gets in there we won't be able to criticize him anymore.</p> <p>Please pick someone else. Like John Kasich. I mean that guy seems okay. I don't like any of them myself but if you're that kind of voter please go for a guy like that. It feels like between him and either democrat we'd have a decent choice. It feels like a healthier choice. We shouldn't have to vote for someone because they're not a shocking cunt billionaire liar.</p> <p>We should choose based on what direction the country should go.</p> <p>I get that all these people sound like bullshit soft criminal opportunists. The whole game feels rigged and it's not going anywhere but down anymore. I feel that way sometimes.</p> <p>And that voting for Trump is a way of saying "fuck it. Fuck them all". I really get it. It's a version of national Suicide. Or it's like a big hit off of a crack pipe. Somehow we can't help it. Or we know that if we vote for Trump our phones will be a reliable source of dopamine for the next four years. I mean I can't wait to read about Trump every day. It's a rush. But you have to know this is not healthy.</p> <p>If you are a true conservative. Don't vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you.</p> <p>In fact, if you do vote for Trump, at least look at him very carefully first. You owe that to the rest of us. Know and understand who he is. Spend one hour on google and just read it all. I don’t mean listen to me or listen to liberals who put him down. Listen to your own people. Listen to John Mccain. Go look at what he just said about Trump. "At a time when our world has never been more complex or more in danger... I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our party's most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world.”</p> <p>When Trump was told what he said, Trump said "Oh, he did? Well, that's not nice," he told CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. "He has to be very careful."</p> <p>When pressed on why, Trump tacked on: "He'll find out.”</p> <p>(I cut and pasted that from CBS news)</p> <p>Do you really want a guy to be president who threatens John McCain? Because John McCain cautiously and intelligently asked for people to be thoughtful before voting for him? He didn’t even insult Trump. He just asked you to take a good look. And Trump told him to look out.</p> <p>Remember that Trump entered this race by saying that McCain is not a war hero. A guy who was shot down, body broken and kept in a POW camp for years. Trump said “I prefer the guys who don’t get caught.” Why did he say that? Not because he meant it or because it was important to say. He said it because he’s a bully and every bully knows that when you enter a new school yard, you go to the toughest most respected guy on the yard and you punch him in the nose. If you are still standing after, you’re the new boss. If Trump is president, he’s not going to change. He’s not going to do anything for you. He’s going to do everything for himself and leave you in the dust.</p> <p>So please listen to fellow conservatives. But more importantly, listen to Trump. Listen to all of it. Everything he says. If you liked when he said that “torture works” then go look at where he took it back the next day. He’s a fucking liar.</p> <p>A vote for Trump is so clearly a gut-vote, and again I get it. But add a little brain to it and look the guy up. Because if you vote for him because of how you feel right now, the minute he's president, you're going to regret it. You're going to regret it even more when he gives the job to his son. Because American democracy is broken enough that a guy like that could really fuck things up. That's how Hitler got there. He was voted into power by a fatigued nation and when he got inside, he did all his Hitler things and no one could stop him.</p> <p>Again, I’m not saying vote democrat or vote for anyone else. If Hilary ends up president it should be because she faced the best person you have and you and I both chose her or him or whoever. Trump is not your best. He’s the worst of all of us. He’s a symptom to a problem that is very real. But don’t vote for your own cancer. You’re better than that.</p> <p>That's just my view. At least right now. I know I’m not qualified or particularly educated and I'm not right instead of you. I’m an idiot and I'm sure a bunch of you are very annoyed by this. Fucking celebrity with an opinion. I swear this isn’t really a political opinion. You don’t want to know my political opinions. (And I know that I’m only bringing myself trouble with this shit.) Trump has nothing to do with politics or ideology. He has to do with himself. And really I don't mean to insult anyone. Except Trump. I mean to insult him very much. And really I’m not saying he’s evil or a monster. In fact I don’t think Hitler was. The problem with saying that guys like that are monsters is that we don’t see them coming when they turn out to be human, which they all are. Everyone is. Trump is a messed up guy with a hole in his heart that he tries to fill with money and attention. He can never ever have enough of either and he’ll never stop trying. He’s sick. Which makes him really really interesting. And he pulls you towards him which somehow feels good or fascinatingly bad. He’s not a monster. He’s a sad man. But all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president. Give him another TV show. Let him pay to put his name on buildings. But please stop voting for him. And please watch Horace and Pete.</p></article>
	<article id="0000667" published-at="2016-09-17" title="Bill Maher’s Urgent Plea for Decency in U.S. Politics: ‘Trump Didn’t Create This Swamp’"><p>After a few weeks off, <a type="internal">political satirist Bill Maher</a> emerged refreshed and more cynical than ever on his program Real Time Friday night.</p> <p>The comedian addressed the week’s biggest controversy during his monologue—Trump finally acknowledging after being at the forefront of a five-year racist crusade against the first black president that Barack Obama was born in the United States. As is his wont, the bloated ex-reality show host delivered the news <a type="internal">in true Trumpian fashion</a>: in seven seconds, during a press conference announcing the grand opening of his tacky new hotel, while flanked by a fellow birther (Thomas McInerney, a retired Air Force lieutenant general), claiming Obama should be thankful that he “finished” the racist speculation he stoked, and that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement (a bold-faced lie).</p> <p>“He blamed it on Hillary. Of course,” said Maher, rolling his eyes. “Because even when [Trump] admits he lies, he has to tell another giant lie! He says Hillary and her campaign started birtherism in 2008, which is something contradicted only by newspapers, television, Twitter, eyes, ears, and smell. Hillary started birtherism? Oh yes, I think we all remember that. I think it was right after Hillary’s casinos went bankrupt.”</p> <p>A softball, Fallon-esque softball interview with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway—who’s been a guest and pal of Maher’s for twenty years dating back to his ABC series Politically Incorrect—followed, as did a bickering panel wherein political pundit Margaret Hoover, serving as the moderate voice of reason, assured the American people that the country “will survive” regardless of who wins the presidency (Hoover is also the wife of Daily Beast EIC John Avlon).</p> <p>But the night’s biggest highlight came courtesy of Maher himself. During a his “New Rules” segment, he delivered an important monologue about the need for a return to decency in American politics.</p> <p>“Both candidates must sign a pledge that whoever loses the election in November, whether it’s Hillary or whether it’s Orange Hitler, the loser has to congratulate the winner and concede graciously. Why? Because civility is nearly dead in this country and we need to return to some basic level of bipartisan decency and respect for our opponents,” offered Maher.</p> <p>“If you want to know why our country is so tense and our government doesn’t work, it’s because society functions on some basic rules of conduct and they’re all going away. It’s why filibustering has become not a rare principled protest, but the everyday automatic cockblocking that defines government now,” he continued. “Ted Cruz filibustered Obamacare for nearly a day by reading Green Eggs and Ham: a book about how you might like something if you give it a chance. It’s why Republicans, who claim to worship the Constitution, can just ignore their duty in fulfilling a Supreme Court vacancy. And speaking of the Supreme Court, which used to stay supremely out of partisan bickering, it’s why Ruth Bader Ginsburg—yes, even sweet, scholarly, grandmotherly Ruth Bader Ginsburg—talked trash about Trump this year like she was in a rap battle.”</p> <p>“But I gotta tell ya: Donald Trump didn’t create this swamp. He just rose from it. He and Hillary are the first two candidates in memory not to call and congratulate each other after they won their respective races. Forever, that’s what people did! Even Al Gore called George W. Bush after he lost—and he didn’t even lose! In the Senate, members used to refer to each other as ‘my friend from the other side of the aisle.’ They didn’t mean it literally, of course—no one thinks of Ted Cruz as a friend—but you say it anyway.”</p> <p>Maher then pointed to the birther movement as playing a large role in the disintegration of bipartisanship in America, but also to when Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouted “You lie!” at POTUS while he delivered a 2009 speech to the joint session of Congress, as well as racist and homophobic Maine Gov. Paul LePage leaving a voicemail for one of his political opponents labeling him a “socialist cocksucker.”</p> <p>“I keep saying that this election is a referendum on decency. It’s a chance to reject the gutter and punish people who want to live there, but right now, we are rewarding them,” said Maher. “The guy who said ‘You lie?’ The next day donations poured into his coffers because now in America, when you act like an asshole you’re a hero.”</p> <p>He then cut to footage of politicians coming to blows in various parliaments around the world. “This is what parliament looks like on a bad day in the Ukraine. And here’s the Turkish parliament. And the one in South Korea. And the one in Nepal. Yeah, we laugh at it, but that is where we’re headed, because the real infectious disease that’s threatening our election isn’t pneumonia—it’s a total lack of class.”</p></article>
	<article id="0000668" published-at="2016-10-05" title="Seth Meyers Calls Out Thrice-Married Trump’s Infidelity Hypocrisy">
NBC <p>Whereas <a type="internal">Late Show’s Stephen Colbert</a> broadcast live following the not-so-hotly anticipated vice-presidential debate <a type="internal">between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine</a>, Late Night’s Seth Meyers went the pre-taped route—instead choosing to focus on the continued fallout from Trump’s embarrassing loss in the first presidential debate.</p> <p>“Trump went on for days insisting that he won the debate, while also complaining about his broken microphone,” said Meyers, adding, “Trump’s campaign did try [to move on], telling the media that at a rally on Saturday night Trump would ‘…deliver a nine-sentence critique of comments Hillary Clinton made months ago about many of the millennials supporting her primary rival, Bernie Sanders.’”</p> <p>Those comments, which were misinterpreted by Politico and The Intercept, actually served as an example of Hillary showing empathy toward Sanders supporters—a sentiment echoed by Sanders himself, who said her comments were <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sanders-clinton-comments-leaked-audio-absolutely-correct/story?id=42496761" type="external">“absolutely correct.”</a> Of course, even that alleged “nine-sentence critique” proved difficult for Donald.</p> <p>“Trump has essentially been in the middle of the same run-on sentence for about a year now. And unfortunately for his campaign, he went on so many angry, unhinged tangents that, according to The Washington Post, ‘It took Trump 25 minutes to read the [nine-sentence] statement,’” said Meyers. “Why did it take 25 minutes to get through nine sentences? Because Trump had to do some classic stand-up comedy: like when he mocked Hillary Clinton’s pneumonia—and a brief fainting spell she suffered as a result.”</p> <p>“And then Trump,” added Meyers, “who has spent days attacking Hillary Clinton for her husband’s infidelities, claimed that Hillary herself had probably cheated on Bill.”</p> <p>Cue Trump at the rally: “Hillary Clinton’s only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself. I don’t even think she’s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth.”</p> <p>Yep, you read that right: Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton, a woman who’s held her family together amid affairs by her husband, of committing adultery based on no evidence whatsoever. But, like most accusations hurled by Trump, it’s pure projection.</p> <p>For if you recall, Trump is on his third marriage. His first, to Ivana, ended acrimoniously when Trump carried on a very public affair with Marla Maples. “By 1987, during services at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, Trump was secretly romancing Maples as he found ways to temporarily ditch Ivana and their kids,” <a href="http://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-donald-ducks-out-vol-47-no-19/" type="external">reported</a> People magazine.If that weren’t enough, during the subsequent divorce proceedings, Ivana reportedly <a type="internal">accused Donald of a violent rape</a>.</p> <p>“Of course, Trump’s own first marriage ended when he cheated on [Ivana] with his eventual second wife [Maples],” said Meyers. “So you might think maybe this isn’t the best argument for Trump to make—which is why the Trump team sent their best man, Rudy Giuliani, to go on TV and make it again.”</p> <p>Sure enough, the former New York mayor appeared on numerous cable-news programs defending Trump’s baseless smear against Hillary, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper it was “fair game” and Meet the Press’s Chuck Todd that “everybody” commits infidelities.</p> <p>Rudy would know. His first marriage, to his second-cousin Regina Peruggi, ended in divorce, and his second marriage, to Donna Hanover, ended when he conducted a high-profile affair with Judith Nathan—even going so far as providing her with security and chauffeur services courtesy of the NYPD while he was mayor (translation: taxpayers helped pay for Rudy concealing his affair).</p> <p>The Trump camp’s hypocrisy apparently knows no bounds.</p></article>
	<article id="0000669" published-at="2016-10-08" title="Louis C.K. on the Time He Met the ‘Real Trump’: A ‘Miserable,’ Money-Grubbing Narcissist">
FX <p>According <a type="internal">to Louis C.K.</a>, Trump supporters are essentially charitable givers.</p> <p>On Friday night, the beloved comic behind Louie and Horace and Pete took on The New Yorker Festival in a 90-minute chat with television critic Emily Nussbaum. In the heart of Times Square, the writer and director unloaded on the Republican presidential candidate and the massive, greedy hole where his heart should be.</p> <p>Talking in depth about Horace and Pete, C.K.’s 10-episode online tragedy, Nussbaum and C.K. naturally transitioned from discussing “perfect narcissists” onscreen to the raging egomaniac currently trampling towards the White House. According to the seasoned comedian, “People are usually bad when they’re hurting.” His lifelong desire to give disgusting people emotional depth has made C.K. into a keen observer of human behavior. When Nussbaum asked him about a specific reference in Horace and Pete to the “president-hole” that Trump is trying to fill, Louis revealed that his musings on the tax-evading real estate tycoon <a type="internal">were many years in the making</a>: “It’s something I thought about Trump a long time ago, because I met him in an elevator.”</p> <p>“That’s where you want to meet the dude,” Louis quipped. “That’s the real Trump.”</p> <p>But C.K. wasn’t kidding. Apparently, the comedian was working at a Trump casino, many years ago, when the run-in went down. While working at what was doubtlessly an <a type="internal">impeccably-run, fine establishment</a>—Trump’s Castle in Atlantic City—C.K. started <a type="internal">to notice a disturbing trend</a>. “I saw this thing happening where buses were showing up from all over the country with little old ladies,” he explained. “They take what little they have…They take that nothing, the little tiny scraps, and they turn it into chips and they pour buckets of money into his machines.”</p> <p>When Trump and his toupee finally made an appearance in Atlantic City, Louis was shocked to see that he just walked around, expressing absolutely no gratitude to the folks who filled his coffers. “He didn’t say ‘thank you’ to anybody, he just walked around… and when I was in the elevator with him I just looked in his face, and he was just miserable looking. And everybody was so excited to see him, and they’re giving him everything.”</p> <p>At this point, C.K. came up with the theory that fueled that Horace and Pete punchline. He recalled thinking, “He has everything, right? And they’re leaving on the same bus just with nothing; they’re ruining their lives. And I saw this like as a reverse-charity…These women, these old ladies, they don’t need anything. They live in a shitty place and they have two dollars, and they’re like, ‘Eh, I don’t need it, it’s ok, he needs it!’ If he looks in the mirror, and he has ten dollars, he’s going to kill himself.” He concluded, “He has a $10 billion deficit in his heart. So if he doesn’t have that much money, he’s nothing. So they were like, ‘Donald, you take this!’ Because they’re invested in his charity.’”</p> <p>After the uproarious applause died down, Louis noted, solemnly, that Trump’s insatiable love of money has somehow metastasized into a president-sized hole: “He’s like, ‘Thank you for your money, now I need control over your lives.’”</p> <p>When Nussbaum followed up by comparing Trump to an insult comic and asking if Louis had any comedian’s wisdom for Hillary to take him down, he was quick to differentiate Trump’s unstudied craft from the work of seasoned professionals. According to Louis, insult comics are “good people who know how to fuck somebody up.” He described <a type="internal">legend Don Rickles</a> as a “precision talent”—in contrast, “The thing with Donald Trump is, he’s not in control.”</p> <p>While the beloved comic is positive that Trump will insult audience members and scandalize constituents at Sunday’s town hall debate, he quickly assured the audience that, “I’ll be watching. That’s why we’re doing this whole election: Because we’d rather watch awful shit than have good roads and have poor people not die all the time.”</p> <p>As for Hillary, Louis was adamant, “I don’t think she needs any advice from anybody. She’s unbelievable.” He even said that the former Secretary of State, “Reminds me of my mom—she works hard, and then she goes, ‘All right, go ahead and talk, I’m doing this.’ So I like her.” And for the people who insist that Clinton is a liar and a crook, Louis has one, small, question: “What the fuck do you know?”</p></article>

Image source: TheBlaze <p>Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye, on Tuesday’s airing of CNN’s “New Day,” insisted that even in 2017, every “non-Indian out there” is a “guest of Native Americans.”</p> What did he say? <p>Speaking with CNN’s Alisyn Camerota and actor, producer, and founder of American Indians in Film and Television, Sonny Skyhawk, Begaye discussed <a type="internal">President Donald Trump’s “Pocahontas” quip during his Monday meeting honoring Native American veterans</a>, which he called “unnecessary” and “culturally insensitive.”</p> <p>Later during the interview, Camerota asked Begaye what he wanted from the president after Monday’s viral “Pocahontas” incident.</p> <p>“What do you want from the president? Do you want an apology?” Camerota asked.</p> <p>Begaye responded that he wants Trump to continue honoring Navajo “code talkers” and veterans and respect their sacrifices.</p> <p>He explained, “That’s who we are as Americans, we thank each other, especially in defense of freedom of this great nation, and for Native Americans, this is our land.”</p> <p>“Every inch of it, every mountain, every stream, every water that is out there, it is ours,” he added. “It’s Native American country.

	<article id="0000671" published-at="2016-10-09" title="Could Missouri Be in Play Now, Too? Jay Nixon Thinks So.">
Jay Nixon. <p>Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</p> <p>ST. LOUIS—Missouri has a competitive Senate race. It has a competitive governor's race. According to polls of the presidential race, though, there’s not much of a contest here in the state that Sen. Barack Obama lost by only a few thousand votes in 2008. Trump enjoys a 10.6 percentage point lead here, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/mo/missouri_trump_vs_clinton-5609.html#polls" type="external">according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.</a> It’s one of the few states in the country where Trump is running ahead of the Republican candidates in prestige, statewide downballot races.</p> <p>But Jay Nixon, Missouri’s outgoing Democratic governor, isn’t so sure Trump can bank on the state’s 10 electoral votes just yet.</p> <p>“Well, he hasn’t had a good week. Haven’t seen any numbers recently,” he told Slate at Washington University ahead of Sunday’s second debate. “I think Missouri’s a state where you still have enough undecideds to get this race close. I think it will tighten. I think that his conduct over the last—both in the last debate as well as over the last 10 days—is something that jars people. This is not the way presidents are supposed to act or talk.”</p> <p>Nixon was walking on Wash U’s main lawn shaking hands with students, surrounded by a few bodyguards. It wasn’t the most … natural of settings. Nixon is a middle-aged conservative Democrat, and here he was mixing with students trying to garner attention for themselves in their own, trollish baccalaureate ways. More than one student was holding a “Lizard People for Hillary” sign, while another American-flag-garbed student held a banner reading, “Outback Steakhouse for Trump.” (He had a second, handwritten poster: “Bloomin’ Onion now only $7.00.") Two other students standing next to each other held up color-coordinated signs that read, respectively, “Proud Muslim” and “Harambe 2016.” Music was playing, students were eating ice cream and pizza, or grabbing free Fox News T-shirts by the network’s adjacent set. And then there was the governor, wandering through it all.</p> <p>Nixon added that it would be unwise for Trump to go after Bill Clinton’s affairs and Hillary Clinton’s role in aiding her husband in the cover-ups. “I think that if he does what I think a lot of people think he might do tonight—come out and try to attack somebody who used to be president, when he’s talking to somebody who’s going to be president—I think that’s a serious mistake,” he said.</p> <p>So how should Hillary Clinton respond when Trump definitely does that?</p> <p>“Like any woman, if they’re pushed in that direction, they need to be very clear, they need to be unambiguous, and they need to call out his behavior to the American people.”</p> <p>He said it’s up to the Clinton campaign to decide whether it’s worth it for them to make an appearance in Missouri. It’s not—unless she just wants to psych out Trump. If Hillary Clinton wins Missouri, she’s already won somewhere north of 350 electoral votes. It will be a state caught up in a landslide, the possibility of which seems much more likely than it did 72 hours ago.</p></article>
	<article id="0000672" published-at="2016-10-09" title="Well, Donald Trump Just Threatened to Throw Hillary Clinton in Jail">
It's ugly out there tonight. <p>And another norm of American politics has been shattered.</p> <p>During Sunday night’s presidential debate, Donald Trump went on a fairly standard-issue rant about Hillary Clinton’s email scandal—then added a horrifying twist, suggesting he will try to prosecute her over it if he's elected president.</p> <p>Trump: If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation. There has never been so many lies, so much exception.There has never been anything like it. We will have a special prosecutor. I go out and speak and the people of this country are furious. The long time workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this with emails. You get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails and acid wash them or bleach them. An expensive process. We will get a special prosecutor and look into it. You know what, people have been—their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you have done. You should be ashamed.</p> <p>Moderator: Secretary Clinton, I will let you respond.</p> <p>Clinton: Everything he said is absolutely false. It would be impossible to be fact checking Donald all the time. I would never get to talk and make lives better for people. Once again, go to Hillaryclinton.com. You can fact check Trump in realtime. Last time at the first debate we had millions of people fact checking and we will have millions more fact checking. It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.</p> <p>Trump: Because you would be in jail.</p> <p>The tl;dr version: If I am president, I will appoint a special prosecutor and if I were in charge of the law you'd be in jail. Without belaboring the point, prosecuting your former political opponent is the sort of action Americans typically associate with dictators, like <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-23343788" type="external">Vladimir Putin</a>.</p></article>

	<article id="0000676" published-at="2016-11-02" title="Trump campaigning in stretch like it all depends on Florida"><p>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — With the turbulent White House race scrambled in new directions, Donald Trump is campaigning with rare discipline like his presidential campaign hinges on one all-too-familiar swing state: Florida.</p> <p>“‘Stay on point, Donald, stay on point,'” the Republican nominee, in Pensacola, teasingly quoted his staff as saying. “No sidetracks, Donald. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.'”</p> <p>There was late action Wednesday in such unlikely arenas as Arizona and Michigan, too — and in North Carolina, where President Barack Obama tried to energize black support for Hillary Clinton. But Trump marched ahead in his third multi-day visit to the Sunshine State in recent weeks.</p> <p>The Republican nominee lashed out at “Crooked Hillary” in Miami, predicting that a Clinton victory would trigger an “unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis” as federal investigators probe the former secretary of state’s email practices. But Trump did not take the bait dangled by the Clinton campaign about his treatment of women.</p> <p>Conceding nothing in the state, Clinton has also been a frequent visitor. She posed for pictures and shook hands during a surprise visit to a South Florida Caribbean-American neighborhood Wednesday morning.</p> <p>Both sides agree the New York businessman has virtually no chance to win the presidency without Florida’s trove of 29 electoral votes. Clinton has been ahead there in opinion polls, but Democrats acknowledge that the FBI’s renewed attention to her has helped rally reluctant Republicans behind their nominee. That’s given Trump an enthusiasm boost in Florida and across Midwestern battlegrounds long considered reliably blue territory.</p> <p>“I’m definitely nervous,” said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat. “Democrats in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, if you heard it was over, if you thought those states were in the bag, don’t believe it.”</p> <p>Perhaps heeding Rendell’s warning, Clinton’s team is devoting new resources to states like Michigan, which hasn’t supported a Republican presidential nominee in nearly three decades.</p> <p>Former President Bill Clinton was making an unannounced appearance in Detroit Wednesday night to meet privately with black ministers, the city’s mayor and other local leaders. While Hillary Clinton had two appearances Wednesday in Republican-leaning Arizona, she planned to spend part of Friday in Detroit as well.</p> <p>At the same time, a pro-Clinton super PAC was spending more than $1 million on Michigan airwaves along with at least $1 million more in Colorado, another state where Clinton has enjoyed a significant polling advantage for much of the fall.</p> <p>Early voting numbers in some states suggest that her challenge stems, at least in part, from underwhelming support from African-American voters. Weak minority support could complicate her path in other states, too, including North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p> <p>Early voting in North Carolina shows a 5 percentage point drop in ballots from black voters from 2012.</p> <p>Obama, the nation’s first black president, offered an urgent message to North Carolina voters on Wednesday: “The fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders.”</p> <p>He also criticized Trump’s history of sexist comments and his initial reluctance to disavow white supremacists. They continue to rally behind the Republican nominee, though he rejects that support.</p> <p>“If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers,” Obama said, “then you’ll tolerate that support when you’re in office.”</p> <p>At the same time, Clinton allies are speaking directly to black voters in a new advertising campaign running in Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. The ad from the pro-Clinton Priorities USA shows white Trump supporters screaming at and pushing black protesters, along with Obama warning that voters would lose “everything” if Trump wins.</p> <p>As the final-days scramble for votes intensifies, Florida remains perhaps the nation’s most critical swing state.</p> <p>The Trump campaign knows there is no realistic path to the White House without Florida, where polls give Clinton a narrow lead. The New York businessman campaigned in three Florida cities Wednesday — Miami, Orlando and Pensacola — and will follow up with a stop in Jacksonville on Thursday.</p> <p>“We don’t want to blow this,” he told rowdy supporters in Miami. “We gotta win. We gotta win big.”</p> <p>While Trump has devoted perhaps his most valuable resource — his time — to Florida, Clinton has built a powerful ground game, backed by a dominant media presence, that dwarfs her opponent’s. The Democratic nominee has more than doubled Trump’s investment in Florida television ads. Overall, the state has been deluged with $125 million in general election advertising — by far the most of any state.</p> <p>Clinton, unlike Trump, can also afford to lose here.</p> <p>Even with national polls narrowing, the Democratic contender has many more paths to 270 electoral votes. One example: Clinton campaigned Wednesday in Arizona, a state that has voted for Republican presidential candidates all but once since 1952.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Peoples reported from Washington.

	<article id="0000679" published-at="2016-10-31" title="FBI Director James Comey erred by bowing to the howls of the right">
FBI Director James Comey testifies before the House Oversight Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington, July 7, 2016. Hillary Clinton supporters and even some Republicans have blasted Comey for the timing of his Oct. 28 letter to Congress disclosing new emails that could be connected to the dormant inquiry into Clinton’s private email server. (Al Drago/The New York Times) <p>The cryptic letter James Comey, the FBI director, sent to Congress on Friday looked bizarre at the time — seeming to hint at a major new Clinton scandal, but offering no substance. Given what we know now, however, it was worse than bizarre, it was outrageous. Comey apparently had no evidence suggesting any wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton; he violated long-standing rules about commenting on politically sensitive investigations close to an election; and he did so despite being warned by other officials that he was doing something terribly wrong.</p> <p>So what happened? We may never know the full story, but the best guess is that Comey, like many others — media organizations, would-be nonpartisan advocacy groups, and more — let himself be bullied by the usual suspects. Working the refs — screaming about bias and unfair treatment, no matter how favorable the treatment actually is — has been a consistent, long-term political strategy on the right. And the reason it keeps happening is because it so often works.</p> <p>You see this most obviously in news coverage. Reporters who find themselves shut up in pens at Donald Trump rallies while the crowd shouts abuse shouldn’t be surprised: constant accusations of liberal media bias have been a staple of Republican rhetoric for decades. And why not? The pressure has been effective.</p> <p>Part of this effectiveness comes through false equivalence: news organizations, afraid of being attacked for bias, give evenhanded treatment to lies and truth. Way back in 2000 I suggested that if a Republican candidate said that the earth was flat, headlines would read, “Views differ on shape of planet.” That still happens.</p> <p>The desire to get right-wing critics off one’s back may also explain why the news media keep falling for fake scandals. There’s a straight line from the Whitewater investigation — which ran for seven years, was endlessly hyped in the press, but never found any wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons — to the catastrophically bad coverage of the Clinton Foundation a couple of months ago. Remember when The Associated Press suggested scandalous undue influence based on a meeting between Hillary Clinton and a donor who just happened to be both a Nobel Prize winner and an old personal friend?</p> <p>Sure enough, much of the initial coverage of the Comey letter was based not on what the letter said, which was very little, but on a false, malicious characterization of the letter by Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. You might think reporters would have learned by now not to take what people like Chaffetz say at face value. Apparently not.</p> <p>Nor is it just the news media. A few years ago, during the peak of deficit-scold influence, it was striking to see the various organizations demanding deficit reduction pretend that Democrats who were willing to compromise and Republicans who insisted on slashing taxes for the wealthy were equally at fault. They even gave a “fiscal responsibility” award to Paul Ryan, whose budget proposals gave smoke and mirrors a bad name.</p> <p>And as someone who still keeps a foot in the academic world, I’ve been watching pressure build on universities to hire more conservatives. Never mind the way climate denial, attacks on the theory of evolution, and all that may have pushed academics out of the GOP. The fact that relatively few conservatives teach, say, physics, is supposed to be grossly unfair. And you know some schools will start hiring less qualified people in response.</p> <p>Which brings us back to Comey. It seemed obvious from the start that Clinton’s decision to follow Colin Powell’s advice and bypass State Department email was a mistake, but nothing remotely approaching a crime. But Comey was subjected to a constant barrage of demands that he prosecute her for … something. He should simply have said no. Instead, even while announcing back in July that no charges would be filed, he editorialized about her conduct — a wholly inappropriate thing to do, but probably an attempt to appease the right.</p> <p>It didn’t work, of course. They just demanded more. And it looks as if he tried to buy them off by throwing them a bone just a few days before the election. Whether it will matter politically remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: he destroyed his own reputation.</p> <p>The moral of the story is that appeasing the modern American right is a losing proposition. Nothing you do convinces them that you’re being fair, because fairness has nothing to do with it. The right long ago ran out of good ideas that can be sold on their own merits, so the goal now is to remove merit from the picture.</p> <p>Or to put it another way, they’re trying to create bias, not end it, and weakness — the kind of weakness Comey has so spectacularly displayed — only encourages them to do more.</p></article>

Democratic candidate for United States President Hillary Clinton (L) and Senator Bernie Sanders (R) appear at campaign stop where they talked about Clinton’s plan for less expensive education, at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, New Hampshire, USA, September 28, 2016. EPA/CJ GUNTHER <p>Seattle has a new kind of 1 percenter.</p> <p>Of the 24,700 city residents who contributed to Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries, just 261 — a smidgen over 1 percent — have gone on to give money to another presidential candidate.</p> <p>Of that small group, nearly all have moved their donation to Hillary Clinton. Green Party candidate Jill Stein received money from just 20 ex-Sanders supporters, but that’s enough to rank second.</p> <p>That data comes from <a href="https://www.crowdpac.com/" type="external">Crowdpac</a>, a nonpartisan political-research startup based in based in Menlo Park, Calif. Their team developed an algorithm to analyze data from campaign-contribution records, making it possible to track the donation history of individuals across election cycles.</p> <p>Perhaps what they found is not surprising. Sanders inspired a legion of small-time contributors, many of whom might not normally donate to a political campaign at all.</p> <p>The data suggest that Seattle is indeed a “Bernie or bust” town — at least when it comes to giving money to other candidates. As I wrote back in March, we fell hard for Sanders, <a type="internal">shelling out more per capita to his campaign than residents of any other major city</a>.</p> <p>Chelsea Nesvig, an academic librarian who lives on Capitol Hill, remembers her disappointment when the Vermont senator endorsed Clinton, signaling that his fight for the White House was over.</p> <p>Nesvig, who made a couple of small donations to Sanders, is among the roughly 24,000 in Seattle who have not contributed to another candidate. Still, Nesvig will cast her vote for Clinton. The possibility of a Trump presidency, she feels, is too frightening.</p> <p>Nesvig cautiously calls herself a Clinton supporter — “Are you a supporter if you just say you’re going to vote for her?” — but has no plans to send any money Clinton’s way.</p> <p>“I feel like she’s got plenty of money,” she said. “And that’s one of the things I don’t love about her.”</p> <p>But Dallas Taylor, a novelist and freelance carpenter on Capitol Hill, didn’t skip a beat moving on from Bernie to Hillary, whom he supports enthusiastically.</p> <p>“I switched my ActBlue monthly donations to Hillary about a month before the convention, when it was clear that she had it,” he said.</p> <p>He wasn’t terribly surprised to learn that he’s among the 1 percent: “A lot of the super hard-core Bernie people, especially in Seattle, are privileged enough not to be endangered by a Trump presidency directly,” he said.</p> <p>Taylor, who calls himself a pragmatic progressive, says he never expected Sanders would win. But he felt the campaign was important in how it democratized fundraising and forced Clinton more to the left. These days, he’s trying to convince his progressive friends to get behind Clinton.</p> <p>“I really believe that deep in her heart, Hillary Clinton is a progressive. But she’s also a realist. Nobody plays at that level without getting a little dirty,’ he said. “I’ve never held that against her … and people have this perception that she’s much dirtier than she is.”</p> <p>He’d have a hard time convincing Susan Jacobs, a lighting designer from West Seattle. She can recite a long list of things she doesn’t like about Clinton — from her support of the fracking industry to her past position opposing gay marriage.</p> <p>While she has a very low opinion of Donald Trump, Jacobs doesn’t feel Clinton is that much better. “This is our choice — Trump or Hillary? That’s absurd,” she said. “I’m going to vote for the person who most aligns with my values, and that’s Jill Stein.”</p> <p>Jacob, who contributed to Sanders, hasn’t given to Stein yet. But she’s considering it.</p> <p>Just eight Seattleites who gave money to Sanders have donated to Donald Trump. I managed to track one of them down.</p> <p>I told him he was one of eight. “It makes me kind of interesting,” he replied.</p> <p>A tech worker who lives in Belltown, he would only talk to me if his name wasn’t used, saying he was afraid of repercussions at his workplace. Though he calls his feelings about Trump “complicated,” he sent him money because “ … he is the only credible outsider at this time.”</p> <p>Even so, he might vote for Gary Johnson. the Libertarian candidate, or Stein. The one thing he’s sure of is that he won’t vote for Clinton. “Hillary is part of an insider group that’s getting bigger and bigger,” he said. “And that’s a real threat.”</p> <p>One caveat: The data on candidate contributions present only a partial picture. By law, contributions of $200 or more are required to have donor names and other information. Small individual donations may not be included in the data.</p></article>
	<article id="0000681" published-at="2017-10-15" title="Editorial: California burns: Where’s the president?"><p>As raging wildfires devour the lives, homes and dreams of Californians in an unprecedented scale, one voice has been conspicuously mute through day after day of crisis: President Trump.</p> <p>This is not a man who is reticent to let Americans know what is foremost on his mind. He is also someone who should have learned by now — after devastating hurricanes and the Las Vegas massacre — that Americans expect their president to step forward with empathy and resolve in moments of national trauma.</p> <p>Yet Trump has offered no more than a few perfunctory words about the Wine Country fires that have left at least 40 dead, consumed thousands of structures and stretched the physical and mental mettle of the dedicated firefighters and medical professionals to the edge of exhaustion.</p> <p>On Tuesday, before welcoming the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, Trump said he had spoken with Gov. Jerry Brown and that the federal government would stand with the “people of California and be there with you in this time of terrible tragedy and need.”</p> <p>That’s it? No talk of visiting California? No expressions of appreciation for the first responders? No condolences for those who lost their lives, or the many more who lost their homes? No recognition or pledges of federal support for the monumental task of rebuilding the neighborhoods and business that were devoured in the fire?</p> <p>Then again, how much is a Trump pledge worth, anyway? His typically rapid-fire succession of tweets this week included some that seemed to blame Puerto Rico for its post-hurricane financial crisis and a warning that “We cannot keep FEMA, the Military &amp;amp; the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!”</p> <p>This is a president who views tweets as his primary means of connecting with the people, without the media filter he loathes. Dare we suggest that forcing NFL players to stand for the national anthem — to name one of his recent obsessions — is not a life-and-death situation. The fires are.</p> <p>And how many times has Trump tweeted about the fires since they were whipped by winds into life-threatening force early Monday: zero.</p> <p>Among the subjects that have merited a Trump tweet since then:</p> <p>•Oh, that NFL anthem issue (in which he falsely characterized the commissioner’s position; Roger Goodell did not demand that players stand).</p> <p>•A threat to revoke the licenses of broadcast networks that have become (in his view) too “partisan, distorted and fake” (though there is no federal licensing of broadcast networks).</p> Related Stories <p>•A promotion for his obsequious interview by his Fox News pal Sean Hannity.</p> <p>•A false claim that the New York Times set up “Liddle Bob Corker” by recording its interview with the Republican senator from Tennessee. In fact, Corker had consented to the recording.</p> <p>•Praise for a flattering new book about him.</p> <p>•A false claim that the NFL is “getting massive tax breaks” while its players disrespect the flag, anthem and country. In fact, the league voluntarily relinquished its tax-exempt status two years ago.</p> <p>•A boast: “Nobody could have done what I’ve done for #Puerto Rico with so little appreciation.”</p> <p>•More self-congratulation: “Such a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs (of Fox Business Network) ‘We take up what may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history.’”</p> <p>So how can it be that the loss of 40 human beings on American soil did not merit a single tweet? The most forgiving interpretation would be that Trump, along with the cable networks that seem to attract his laser focus and have not made this a huge story, have a case of disaster fatigue. Perhaps the problem is that he hasn’t been blasted for his underwhelming response:There is no surer way to provoke him to his phone. The most cynical speculation would be that he could not care less about a state that despises him like no other.</p> <p>Devastated California awaits your leadership, Mr. President.

Hundreds of people attend a gathering in Berkeley on Aug. 27, in response to a planned right-wing rally that was canceled. <p>Last month, thousands gathered in San Francisco and Berkeley to defeat the hatred of fascism and white supremacy. A united front of labor, clergy, students, socialists, anarchists and others successfully prevented the fascists from holding their rallies.</p> <p>This is antifa — a broad movement of people who stand against the violence of white supremacists and fascists, violence emboldened by the ascendancy of Donald Trump to the presidency.</p> <p>Despite our victory, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin called for antifa to be classified as a criminal gang. The lesson here is that we cannot depend on the government to meaningfully intervene and prevent the rise of fascism. That is up to us.</p> <p>The National Lawyers Guild, an organization of thousands of lawyers, law students and legal workers across the country, has supported free speech and assembly for all progressive and radical movements for 80 years. But The Chronicle’s coverage of the Aug. 27 rally would have you believe that it is the “alt-right” that seeks to protect speech. This couldn’t be further from the truth.</p> <p>Here are some examples of what the far right does when no one is filming:</p> <p>•Our volunteer attorneys, legal workers and clients have received death threats and their personal information publicized to promote harassment, as a result of our defense of antifa activists;</p> <p>•One attorney was stalked inside the courthouse by a man with a swastika tattoo and a shaved head wearing quasi-military-type attire. He then left, and shortly thereafter she received threatening messages and had to seek protection at a safe house;</p> <p>•A group of men wearing military-like attire, and one with a swastika tattoo, was seen waiting outside Santa Rita Jail for arrestees to be released;</p> <p>•National Lawyers Guild phone lines have been inundated with hate calls.</p> <p>But we are prepared to defend ourselves, and are implementing security plans to ensure the safety of our members, allies and partners. This is hatred and violence, not speech.</p> <p>As an antiracist organization, we refuse to support white supremacists. That does not mean that we oppose free speech.</p> <p>We believe far-right extremists have successfully twisted the right to free speech to cast themselves as victims of exactly what they strive to promote — hate and violence.</p> <p>The far right, however, is not the only problem. The government appears to be colluding with the far right to target antifa. Of six protesters held overnight in jail, only one has been charged with a crime — a woman with a service dog who was brutally pinned to the ground by police, allegedly for throwing an apple. Another was arrested for allegedly pulling their T-shirt over part of their face when photographed by fascists.</p> <p>This campaign to recast antifa as a violent, leftist suppression of speech is a dangerous effort eerily reminiscent of the left-baiting that accompanied the Nazi rise to power.</p> <p>The National Lawyers Guild won’t stand by as fascists and white supremacists seek to take power in the streets and halls of government. We stand in solidarity with all who fight hatred. We will continue to show up, to defend activists who challenge fascism, and we call on all people of conscience to do the same.</p> <p>Nina Farnia is the president of the National Lawyers Guild — San Francisco Bay Area Chapter.

When the suspect learned there was an arrest warrant for that person, he gave officers his real name, police said.</p> <p>Officers learned he also had a warrant out for his arrest and he was taken into custody, police said. At the Richmond Police Department, officers learned the suspect was also on parole.</p> <p>According to police, the suspect allegedly became uncooperative and combative with officers during the booking process. As a result, police decided to drive him to the county jail in Martinez.</p> <p>While in the back seat of a police car, the suspect allegedly slipped his cuffed hands from behind him to his front.

	<article id="0000684" published-at="2016-11-01" title="Winner but for Weiners"><p>Saul Loeb/Getty Images</p> Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin arrive for a NATO foreign minister family photo in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on April 14, 2011. <p>On Friday, the FBI announced that <a type="internal">it had found a few new Hillary Clinton emails</a> to investigate. Since then, many have mused that if Clinton loses this bonkers election, she’ll have been blocked from the presidency by a bunch of dicks.</p> <p>Bill Maher suggested that Clinton’s political future will be decided by “ <a type="internal">out of control cocks</a>,” aka the genitals (and the brains that govern the genitals) of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Anthony Weiner, the ever-sexting husband of Clinton’s right-hand aide Huma Abedin. Likewise, Trump lackey Wayne Allyn Root <a type="internal">gleefully imagined Clinton and Abedin committing suicide</a> in the manner of the final scene of Thelma &amp;amp; Louise, remarking that “Hillary and Huma have been done in by a leaking wiener.”</p> <p>The FBI found the latest Clinton emails during its investigation of Weiner’s alleged sexual messages to a 15-year-old, so there was no avoiding the puns that followed. For Root and many other Trump supporters, the sight of two ambitious women being cock-blocked from power by a man’s dick pics was no doubt a pleasant reflection of the imagery of sexual violence they’ve invoked throughout the campaign. “Hillary sucks, but not like Monica,” these fellows said. “Trump that bitch,” they said. “Put <a type="internal">Hillary’s face on a blow-up doll</a>,” they said. Now, it seems possible that the first woman to beat back a lifetime of sexist attacks all the way to the door of the Oval Office might be thwarted in the final push by the misogyny and sexual predations of three lecherous men.</p> <p>Granted, the most recent FBI email thing has made <a type="internal">a tiny dent</a> in Clinton’s poll numbers. There’s no need to expedite that visa to Canada. But there’s no getting around the fact that Weiner’s unwillingness to curb his sexting habit has harmed his wife’s career and Clinton’s shot at the presidency. Trump has used Weiner’s ill-advised (and potentially criminal) sexts to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/politics/anthony-weiner-sexting-trump-supporter/" type="external">cast doubt on Clinton’s judgment</a> in hiring a woman who married a compulsive virtual cheat. Bill Clinton has been an undeniable liability to his wife’s campaign, both because of his <a type="internal">unpredictable outbursts</a> and his history of infidelity and alleged sexual assault. The Trump train has used Bill’s past to pick away at Hillary’s commitment to gender equality and embarrass her by <a type="internal">trotting out Bill’s accusers</a>, who have <a type="internal">credible claims against Bill but not Hillary</a>, at every opportunity. Remember when Newt Gingrich attempted to force Megyn Kelly to say the phrase “ <a type="internal">Bill Clinton, sexual predator</a>”? That was stupid, but wouldn’t it have been nice if Bill had just been a good person and not done anything wrong, sexually, so hypocrites like Gingrich wouldn’t have had any ammunition in the first place?</p> <p>Then there’s Trump, whose entire worldview is projected through the warped lens of misogyny. That is undoubtedly why women of all political stripes have turned against him, and why some Republican women are starting to have <a type="internal">broader misgivings</a> about their party at large. But it’s also why many men, and probably some delusional women, love him. It’s one of the characteristics that makes him a politically incorrect straight-shooter, an everyman who says what he thinks, a symbol of unapologetically toxic, hostile masculinity that a certain chunk of voters love so much that they’d vote for an anthropomorphized jockstrap before electing a woman to the presidency. Trump’s misogyny is an integral part of his appeal; if Clinton loses, misogyny—Trump’s particular brand of misogyny, not just the misogyny of the modern electorate—will be partially to blame.</p> <p>And so we, the women of America, find ourselves watching in horror and rage as the repulsive sexual behavior of three pathetic men threatens to obstruct the election of a supremely capable first female president and her equally brilliant No. 2. It would be an extraordinary feat of poetic injustice if the most qualified female presidential candidate in history got within a nose hair’s breadth of the office just to be thwarted by a trio of men who’ve disrespected their marriages and prioritized their own sexual proclivities over their wives’ careers and ambitions.</p> <p>The issue here is not whether the emails Weiner inadvertently revealed are of legitimate concern—compared to <a type="internal">anything Trump has ever done</a>, they’re not. The issue is not whether women should be punished for their husband’s sins (they shouldn’t). It’s that people are using those emails and those sexual misdeeds to cast Clinton and Abedin as power-hungry schemers who overlooked their husbands’ moral failings to get ahead. Or worse, to paraphrase the favored Trumpkin narrative, frigid wives whose sharp elbows keep them from properly satisfying their husbands.</p> <p>These narratives persist not because successful, ambitious women keep making poor decisions about their mates. (Still, Huma—glad <a type="internal">you finally realized</a> you didn’t need your joke of a husband.) They continue to stymie the ascension of some of our best political minds because too many men are careless, insecure egomaniacs who engage in malicious deceits of their families and constituents. Clinton and Abedin’s current situation is the perfect allegory for the politics of misogyny and the misogyny of politics in America. This is a magnified version of every time a man has stunted a woman’s career to satisfy his own base desires; every time a man has chosen to harm his wife and his marriage in some pitiful attempt to shore up his fragile ego; every time a man has made dumbass decisions to suit only himself, not caring whether or how he might fundamentally alter the courses of others’ lives for the worse.</p> <p>If one were prone to conspiracy theories, one might wonder whether all the world’s grossest men collaborated on a generationlong plan to keep the first viable female candidate out of the West Wing. (This author is not prone to such theories but encourages those who are to send her the receipts and we’ll talk.) Or the three-sexually-predatory-men vs. Clinton setup might be just the plot device we need to make a Clinton victory an even more cathartic triumph over the hundreds of years of U.S. politics working against women who seek power.</p> <p>But here’s the sad reality: The sexual predations of those three nasty men have about <a type="internal">a 1 in 4 chance</a> of delivering the presidency to Donald “grab them by the pussy” Trump. On Saturday Night Live, just after Trump earned that moniker with the release of the Access Hollywood recording, <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7534315/alec-baldwin-donald-trump-billy-bush-tape-controversy-snl-saturday-night-live" type="external">Michael Che advised</a> “old, rich white dudes” to “always assume you’re being recorded.” I’d add this: Imagine how you’ll feel when your sexts and extramarital affairs <a type="internal">end American democracy</a> as we know it.</p></article>
	<article id="0000685" published-at="2016-09-23" title="Voters Want Hillary Clinton to be the Grown-Up"><p>Carolyn Cole/Getty Images</p> Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Donald Trump take part in a debate at the University of Miami on March 10. <p>An <a href="http://www.newsday.com/opinion/how-hillary-clinton-can-win-the-first-debate-1.12338586" type="external">awful lot</a> of <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/clinton-debate-advice-228431" type="external">very knowledgeable people</a> have been <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/09/10/493399762/now-in-hillarys-corner-businessman-mark-cuban-offers-up-debate-tips" type="external">giving Hillary Clinton</a> advice, both solicited and less solicited, as she prepares to square off against Donald Trump in the first general-election debate on Monday. People are apparently expecting this contest to be a difficult one for the former secretary of state. This piece by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/who-will-win/497561/" type="external">James Fallows</a>, for example, is a must-read explication of why Trump is both good at television and also a formidable liar (which can make him seem like a good debater). But Clinton has an incredible debate prep team, and by all accounts she is preparing as she does for everything: meticulously.</p> <p>The press tells us that these debates will be a pivotal moment in the campaign; a chance to show those undecided and on-the-fencers what a Clinton presidency might mean, or more emphatically, what a Trump presidency <a type="internal">could look like</a>. One demonstrably silly <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/09/21/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debates/90310878/" type="external">media narrative</a> is Clinton must show the country that she is not a liar and Trump must show that—while he is an affront to human dignity and intellect—he is capable of making it through a debate without disgracing himself. So, a totally level playing field!</p> <p>As a former debater myself, I did feel like there is one useful area of focus for Clinton that hasn’t been adequately covered by the media: She will be debating an asshole. There has been much rumination on how challenging it will be for her to debate someone who has no policy positions, and doesn’t know stuff. We worry about the double standard around her clothes <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/gender-barriers/" type="external">and voice</a>. There has been a good deal of throat-clutching over the possibility that he will goad her into losing her cool. But it seems to me the real challenge for Clinton is that she must stand on a stage and debate the single most awful political person in modern American consciousness. Trying to stifle the impulse just to walk across the stage and belt him in the face would seem an insurmountable task. Add to that the fact that Clinton is expected to speak and listen, and it seems beyond human capability.</p> <p>When considering these obstacles, Clinton should realize that she has one sole job in these debates: Be the grown-up. She doesn’t need to be funny. ( <a type="internal">She isn’t</a>.) She doesn’t need to be emotional—that’s how the deeply unfortunate “ <a type="internal">basket of deplorables</a>” remark happened. She doesn’t have to bend over backward to be charming or personable. Her job is to ignore the crazy circus monkey with the broken cymbals and do what she does best: Listen carefully, respond reasonably, and speak to the part of America that truly understands what it means to entrust someone with the nuclear codes.</p> <p>That is not the America of violent stadium rallies or the America of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim7vDk1KPPAhVo3IMKHTQkBOIQFggjMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slate.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe_slatest%2F2016%2F08%2F25%2Fthe_alt_right_is_thrilled_about_hillary_s_alt_right_speech.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNGB9_EBqii_ftlfbiq3wMOMQXtSbQ&amp;sig2=jyiuR0lAnpDQf7QJvtlG4w&amp;bvm=bv.133700528,bs.2,d.dmo" type="external">alt-right chatrooms</a>. For purposes of the debates, even the bare acknowledgement of their world is demeaning.</p> <p>Clinton needs to realize that the split screen is not just a TV device; it reflects the ways in which these two will be appearing on two wholly different programs. She needs to stay off Trump’s show. On his show, he always wins. If, though, she can imagine herself back in Victorian England when children were still largely ignored—even if they were wearing <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=victorian+children%27s+clothing&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=736&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=7V-iirSVfnCEMM%3A%3BUuIVKZNeaWG89M%3Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.victorianchildren.org%2Fvictorian-dress-and-victorian-style-clothing%2F&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=7V-iirSVfnCEMM%3A%2CUuIVKZNeaWG89M%2C_&amp;usg=__F1ptECHmcmcye168GE5xlwf4bb8%3D&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP97Xy36PPAhUEJR4KHWiBD9EQyjcIKQ&amp;ei=WTbkV8_mF4TKeOiCvogN#imgrc=7V-iirSVfnCEMM%3A" type="external">miniaturized adult clothing</a>—she’s on the right track.</p> <p>Too many Americans have been sickened and saddened and dispirited by this campaign. A lot of them are tuning in only now, only reluctantly, to try to clarify what the hell we have become over the course of this past year. The one thing we all need to see, I believe, is that there is even an adult menu available, not just the chicken fingers and the grilled cheese. We need to see absolute sobriety and seriousness, and any effort to engage with the orange whirlwind of self-regard will only be a distraction.</p> <p>Hillary needs to imagine herself back in Victorian England when children were still largely ignored—even if they were wearing miniaturized adult clothing.</p> <p>That brings us to the baskets. The fact that the racists, misogynists, and bigots have not just come out of the woodwork to support Trump but have indeed become his reinforced load-bearing walls is apparently <a type="internal">not to be spoken aloud</a>. Racists, misogynists, and bigots, it seems, are the next big social movement in America. No belittling them. So, Clinton needs to ignore them. She needs not to scold them. If asked about them, she needs to respectfully suggest that this is Trump’s problem, not hers. Adults don’t call voters names, even the bigots. Nobody will be tuning in this week to discover what Hillary Clinton thinks of them anyhow. They want to figure out what they think of her.</p> <p>So here’s the great news: Everything Clinton needs to do involve skills she has in spades. She is an adult. She is an expert. She can talk about policy in frightening detail. She isn’t an entertainer, or a pastor, or a porn star. That’s all to the good. There is no doubt whatsoever that anyone tuning in Monday to be amused, or cuddled, or fake-understood, will find her robotic and probably even cold. People, as it turns out, really like porn stars.</p> <p>But anyone who wants to see, for the first time since the primaries, how fully realized adult humans speak, think, and behave, will want to see that Clinton, the one <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/michelle-obama-when-they-go-low-we-go-high" type="external">Michelle Obama promised would “go high</a>” no matter what lows are being imposed upon us all. Not one word should be uttered by the former secretary of state that would not have been spoken in public by Winston Churchill, or a four-star general, or Abraham Lincoln. If that means resisting the temptation to launch zingers or references to the <a type="internal">breakup of Angelina and Brad</a>, so be it.</p> <p>Whatever party they may prefer, Americans are terrified right now. They are terrified of violence, and racial strife, and ISIS, and—I’d suspect—most Americans are terrified of what this race has done to presidential elections. Steadiness and sanity may not make for great reality television. But the other alternative does not make for very great reality.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton was probably born an earnest, sober middle-aged woman. Donald Trump was born a toddler and doesn’t appear to have moved up much along the developmental charts. She needs to have the confidence to understand that Americans are able and willing to reckon with the difference between the two.</p></article>
	<article id="0000686" published-at="2016-10-08" title="The Real Donald Trump"><p>Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images</p> Donald Trump and Mike Pence, one of his many Republican supporters. <p>For months now, Hillary Clinton has occasionally been using some version of this Maya Angelou quote when she discusses Donald Trump on the campaign trail: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” This is usually followed by some variation on another line Clinton used at the Democratic National Convention in July: “There is no other Donald Trump. This is it.”</p> <p>After months of controversies over Trump’s personal attacks on women, his racist talk about an American judge of Mexican heritage, his casual slurs of immigrants and a Muslim American Gold Star family, and countless other controversies, it seemed as though the folks who were determined to back Trump saw and understood perfectly well who he was and had accepted it. More maddening, it seemed <a type="internal">they just didn’t care</a>.</p> <p>That’s why, when the story broke on Friday that Donald Trump was caught on a live mic bragging about how he could kiss women—and grab their genitals—without their consent because he was famous, I initially wondered what the news was. Was there anyone alive surprised here? Voters have watched Trump joyfully trash and objectify women for more than a year. Republicans and their leaders have been offered evidence of Trump as an unrepentant pig since the primaries began.</p> <p>His supporters have tolerated his rampant sexism, xenophobia, threats of violence and lawlessness, and so much more. So why should talk of grabbing a woman’s pussy with impunity become the straw that broke the camel’s back? As Clinton has suggested, often with great frustration, Trump has been showing us who he really is for months, if not years.</p> <p>Here’s the reason it really did become the last straw, why so many Republican politicians who had previously supported Trump are now either renouncing their support or calling for him to drop out (by Saturday afternoon it was <a type="internal">more than a dozen</a>). Historically, all these Republicans could actually pretend Trump was just kidding; they could deny that Trump was who everyone knew that he was. Consider Trump’s running mate Mike Pence’s debate performance on Wednesday, where he spent most of his time <a type="internal">simply asserting</a> that Trump had never said and done so many of the horrible things he had said and done. Using this logic—He doesn’t really mean all these horrible things, he’s a performer not a polished politician, you are misinterpreting what he said—they could cover for him indefinitely.</p> <p>The groping tape is different, it reveals both the real Trump and the performer Trump, and it turns out the former is actually scarier than the latter.</p> <p>Partly it’s because we clearly hear a new version of Trump’s voice on the tape. Yes, his standard swaggering tone—so incredibly familiar at this point—is present. But in this tape he’s not bragging at us in a way he wants us to hear. It’s startling because it’s both perfectly recognizable and perfectly novel in its utter grotesqueness. Partly it’s the coarseness, the glowing pride he takes in acts of sexual violence, that makes this feel different from even the worst comments he has made in the past. But the real reason Trump’s “pussy” comments may prove to be the death knell for the nominee—and have led so many in his own party to abandon him already—is that it definitively proves the truth about the things Trump says: Contrary to his <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/politics/donald-trump-carly-fiorina-entertainer/" type="external">repeated claims</a> and his boosters’ hopes, these words aren’t just “ <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC6ea_iszPAhUM32MKHa-sAxIQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slate.com%2Farticles%2Fnews_and_politics%2Fjurisprudence%2F2016%2F08%2Ftrump_s_assassination_joke_is_the_logical_endpoint_for_the_gop.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1zvDGvSE-ryBsQVLuBLvKnFPj3Q&amp;sig2=e7vn4ju0X7riJm1qezesRg&amp;bvm=bv.135258522,d.cGc" type="external">jokes</a>” or him playing a role as an “ <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuxJfTiszPAhUS8mMKHUmWC-UQqQIIMjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcclatchydc.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics-government%2Felection%2Farticle106486462.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDptXlwCGM-sIOQdpPeJ5C5qO4Dg&amp;sig2=4cvA_gQgObbIEO5rV1D9Kg&amp;bvm=bv.135258522,d.cGc" type="external">entertainer</a>.” These words are who he really is. There is no hiding from that now.</p> <p>What changed with Friday’s video revelation is that Trump has been caught in the perfect duality of a born performer: On the bus with Billy Bush, he’s the braggart, the player, the one who cares only about tits and his score sheet— <a type="internal">a woman’s physical autonomy and the law itself be damned</a>. The tape lets us see what happens when the cameras come on and the woman he had been describing as an amalgam of legs, purple, and hotness becomes an actual human person, as he switches to performance mode. We watch his face shift into his entertainer mask, we hear his voice soften and witness his fake avuncular performance. He greets his costar for the day—the soap opera actress Arianne Zucker—with a manly, almost distracted "oh, hello, how are you, hi…" made all the more vile by what we’ve just heard—the real Donald Trump talking as if he was ordering talent off the porno menu.</p> <p>It’s not just, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/08/donald-trump-tape-arianne-zucker-sexual-assault-groping" type="external">as Jessica Valenti points out</a>, that Arianne Zucker is the punchline to Trump and Bush’s ugly joke. It’s that she is the unknowing witness to the performance of professional civility in a man who just finished arming himself with Tic Tacs in case he felt himself compelled to sexually assault her for the crime of being an attractive woman.</p> <p>The reason the video may prove to be the last gasp for Donald Trump’s campaign is that it inverts the story he’s been telling us all along: that the sexism, the skirt-chasing, the jolly recreational objectification of young girls and women is just a persona he affects for the cameras. Now we are offered incontrovertible proof of the truth we could never force his supporters to acknowledge: The monstrous woman-hater is actually the person under the performer.</p> <p>The stark contrast between the story he’s been selling about which part of his life was staged and which part is real is finally revealed. Even for those who have suspected it all along, the fact that Trump hasn’t been just playing a pig, but actually is one, is shocking to hear and see. For those who would deny that reality, this tape makes the task of defending him all but impossible. Anyone who stands with the real Trump now—the Trump who thinks that furniture is foreplay and that women are basically just furniture—will never be able to hide from that fact again.</p> <p>"That’s why, when the story broke on Friday that Donald Trump was caught on a live mic bragging about how he could kiss women—and grab their genitals—without their consent because he was famous, I initially wondered what the news was. <a href="" type="external">More...</a></p> <p>There is no other Donald Trump.

	<article id="0000687" published-at="2016-06-23" title="Donald Trump’s Next-Generation Bigotry"><p>Mandel Ngan/Getty Images</p> Immigration activists protest outside of the Republican National Committee while Donald Trump met with party leaders in Washington on May 12. <p>Donald Trump says he’ll protect America from its enemies. He’ll build a wall on the Mexican border, block Muslim refugees, and slap tariffs on China. But Trump’s latest threats against Muslim Americans, like his attacks on the “ <a type="internal">Mexican</a>” judge in the Trump University fraud case, show that these assaults won’t stop at the border. Trump is now targeting natural-born citizens of the United States, treating them as aliens based on religion or ethnicity. He’s not building walls around America. He’s building walls within it.</p> <p>When Trump <a type="internal">went after Judge Gonzalo Curiel</a> three weeks ago, calling him biased and underhanded because of his “ <a type="internal">heritage</a>,” many Americans cried foul. It’s one thing to campaign against <a type="internal">illegal immigration</a> or even <a type="internal">legal immigration</a>, they noted. It’s quite another to challenge someone born in this country based on his ancestry.</p> <p>The <a type="internal">massacre in Orlando</a> on June 12, awful as it was, gave Trump an opportunity to <a type="internal">change the subject</a> and mend his ways. Instead, he continued—and broadened—his line of attack. He insinuated that Muslim Americans, like Mexican Americans, were disloyal. “Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States,” Trump declared in a <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j-trump-statement-regarding-tragic-terrorist-attacks" type="external">statement</a> hours after the massacre. “Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term—and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.”</p> <p>“Their children.” “The second generation.” Trump wasn’t just arguing, as he had in the past, that the refugees couldn’t be vetted. He was claiming that even if they were vetted, they still had to be kept out of the country, because their offspring might someday become terrorists. This scenario would take place in the future, possibly involving children who were not yet born and influences from abroad that might reach these children without their parents’ knowledge. Therefore, no migrant, regardless of vetting, was safe to admit.</p> <q>
 Under the Clinton plan, you’d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them or to prevent the radicalization of the children—and their children. Not only their children, by the way. They’re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is. </q> <p>Now Trump was talking about a third generation. If the children of migrants didn’t become terrorists, their grandchildren might. And even if none of them did, Muslims were still too dangerous to allow into the country, because they or their descendants might try to tell non-Muslim kids “how wonderful Islam is.”</p> <p>Trump conceded that the killer in Orlando, like the male shooter in San Bernardino, had been born in the United States. But he emphasized that their parents, respectively, were from Afghanistan and Pakistan. He also pointed to the Boston Marathon bombers, whose parents had come from Central Asia. He used these cases to justify a ban not only on Afghans and Pakistanis, but on refugees from Syria, who had committed none of these crimes. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8TLFST5m9M" type="external">Fox News interview</a> after the speech, Bill O’Reilly challenged Trump’s inference. “There really isn’t any linkage that I can find, or the FBI can find, between refugees … women and children, primarily, coming here—and violence,” said O’Reilly. But Trump conceded nothing. “I don’t think you know about linkage yet,” he told O’Reilly. “What’s going to happen two years from now? What’s going to happen 10 years from now?” Trump went on: “Look at the Boston bombers. … Their family came here. And they weren’t radical when they were 6, 7 years old. And all of a sudden, they blew people up.”</p> <p>The next day, June 14, Trump escalated his assault. “The children of Muslim immigrant parents—they’re responsible for a growing number … of terrorist attacks,” he declared at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJdNx-TG11w" type="external">rally in Greensboro, North Carolina</a>. He continued: “Every year we bring in more than 100,000 lifetime immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East. A number of these immigrants have hostile attitudes.” As an example of hostile attitudes, Trump—who had <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?410912-4/donald-trump-addresses-faith-freedom-coalition-conference" type="external">warmly addressed</a> an <a href="https://www.ffcoalition.com/" type="external">anti-gay Christian group</a> just before the Orlando attack—cited Muslim opposition to homosexuality.</p> <p>Trump depicted Muslims, regardless of terrorism, as a cultural threat. In a Fox News interview after the Greensboro speech, Sean Hannity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cNoF92dFzA" type="external">asked Trump</a>: “How do we vet somebody’s heart and ascertain if they’re coming here for freedom, or if they want to proselytize, indoctrinate, and bring their theocracy with them?” Trump replied: “Assimilation has been very hard. It’s almost—I won’t say nonexistent, but it gets to be pretty close. And I’m talking about second and third generation. They don’t—for some reason, there’s no real assimilation. And you see it all over the place.”</p> <p>Since then, Trump has repeated his warnings about American-born Muslims and their children. On Wednesday, at a rally in Atlanta, he repeated his call for an immigration ban, noting that the Orlando killer “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_HOIcRSlEU" type="external">was born here, but his parents weren’t</a>.” Afterward, Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbaRLCxXrBg" type="external">told</a> Greta Van Susteren: “The second generation—if you look at this, and I’ve done actually a pretty good study on it—the second generation can be as violent or more violent than the first.” On Wednesday, in a prepared speech, he <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?411564-1/donald-trump-delivers-remarks-new-york-city" type="external">warned again</a> of the terror threat from “ <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-on-the-stakes-of-the-election" type="external">recent immigrants and their children</a>.”</p> <p>That’s how Trump sees the United States. If your ancestors came from Europe, as Trump’s mother did, you’re American.</p> <p>Trump’s attacks on Latino, Arab, and Muslim Americans predate San Bernardino, and they extend from crime to sheer otherness. Last September, he <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/02/exclusive-donald-trump-fires-back-at-jeb-bush-he-should-lead-by-speaking-english-while-in-the-united-states/" type="external">criticized Jeb Bush</a> for speaking Spanish. “To assimilate, you have to speak English,” Trump <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/09/16/trump_to_bush_this_is_a_country_where_we_speak_english_not_spanish.html" type="external">insisted</a> during a <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=110756" type="external">Republican debate</a>. “We have to have assimilation to have a country.” In November, at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPqV41bfC0" type="external">rally in Birmingham, Alabama</a>, Trump called for a package deal: a wall on the Mexican border and a database to track Muslims in the United States. He asserted, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/22/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-thousands-new-jersey-ch/" type="external">without evidence</a>, that “ <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-ben-carson/story?id=35336008" type="external">large Arab populations</a>” in New Jersey—“thousands and thousands of people”—had cheered on 9/11 when the World Trade Center collapsed. And he vowed to expel “anchor babies” who had been born in the United States to Mexican parents.</p> <p>Trump has targeted people of other ethnicities as well. He questioned the religious integrity of Sen. Ted Cruz, citing Cruz’s <a type="internal">Cuban ancestry</a>. He disputed Cruz’s eligibility for the presidency on the grounds that Cruz, despite his mother’s American citizenship, was <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/donald-trump-ted-cruz-canada-222347" type="external">born in Canada</a>. Trump has also challenged President Obama’s legitimacy, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/207897542971752448" type="external">claiming</a> that Obama was “ <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/25/mitt-romney-s-new-bff-donald-trump.html" type="external">born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia</a>” and <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/donald-trump/2011/03/30/trump-obama-maybe-hes-muslim" type="external">might be a Muslim</a>. Last week, Trump suggested that Obama, in the face of Islamic terrorism, isn’t protecting America because he “ <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jun/15/context-did-donald-trump-suggest-barack-obama-has-/" type="external">has something else in mind</a>.”</p> <p>When Trump goes after Obama’s or Cruz’s place of birth, he’s challenging their legal status. But when he goes after their heritage or religion, he’s doing something subtler. It’s the same thing Trump has done to Curiel and to American Muslims: He’s attacking the second generation. He’s also appealing to white suspicions that minorities get unfair advantages. If Obama was born in this country, says Trump, “ <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2641067/Donald-Trump-thinks-theres-good-chance-Obama-dodged-50-million-offer-student-records-Obama-PRETENDED-Kenyan-order-attract-financial-aid.html" type="external">there’s a very good chance</a>” that Obama pretended to be Kenyan in order to get into college and get financial aid. Trump has leveled similar accusations at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, claiming that she “ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-pocahontas-attack-leaves-fellow-republicans-squirming-again/2016/06/10/01805d22-2f1f-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html" type="external">scammed</a>” universities by representing herself as part Cherokee. Trump routinely mocks Warren as “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcFIp7-_WzE" type="external">Pocahontas</a>” and “ <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/03/21/trump-elizabeth-warren-you-mean-indian" type="external">the Indian</a>.” Years ago, he questioned the authenticity of the Mashantucket Pequots, a Connecticut tribe. “ <a href="http://articles.courant.com/1993-10-06/news/0000003863_1_indian-casinos-mashantucket-pequots-foxwoods-casino" type="external">They don’t look like Indians</a>,” said Trump.</p> <p>The next group on Trump’s target list might be Asian Americans. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rZC3PLhbX4" type="external">several</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4TDe7XVdRs" type="external">speeches</a> last week, he lambasted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhV1F0j3XI" type="external">China, Japan, Vietnam, India, and South Korea</a>, claiming that they rip off the United States in trade, take American jobs, and don’t pay us enough for military protection. That sounds a lot like Trump’s beefs against Mexico, which he later <a type="internal">invoked as a reason to accuse Curiel</a> of “ <a type="internal">inherent</a>” bias against him. Last fall, after Trump <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?328623-6/presidential-candidate-donald-trump-labels-convention" type="external">spoke in New Hampshire</a>, a college student tried to ask him about his allegations against South Korea. The student, a <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/15/448718726/south-korea-trumps-where-are-you-from-moment" type="external">Texas-born Korean American</a> dressed in a Harvard sweatshirt, spoke in perfect, accent-free English. But before he could get his question out—and endure Trump’s subsequent rant against South Korea and Japan—Trump interrupted him with a question of his own: “Are you from South Korea?”</p> <p>The vast majority of legal immigrants are more patriotic toward the USA than confederate flag waving scum republicans. Love it or leave it. <a href="" type="external">More...</a></p> <p>That’s how Trump sees the United States. If your ancestors came from Europe, as <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/windpower/9140774/Donald-Trump-an-unlikely-Braveheart-prepares-to-defend-Scotlands-coastline-from-wind-farms.html" type="external">Trump’s mother did</a>, you’re American. If they came from Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, or Asia, you’re only provisionally American. When Trump wants your vote, he’ll put a “the” in front of your ethnicity, <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/728297587418247168" type="external">bragging</a> about his relations with “ <a href="http://gawker.com/the-collected-quotes-of-donald-trump-on-the-blacks-1719961925" type="external">the blacks</a>” or “ <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-way-donald-trump-speaks-toand-aboutminorities/481155/" type="external">the Hispanics</a>.” He’ll even claim, as he did in his <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?411564-1/donald-trump-delivers-remarks-new-york-city" type="external">speech on Wednesday</a>, that his anti-immigrant policies would <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-on-the-stakes-of-the-election" type="external">help American minorities</a>. But deep down, when there’s political advantage to be gained by dividing and scapegoating, Trump doesn’t believe in American minorities. If you’re a minority, you and your descendants will always be on probation. Don’t forget it.</p></article>

In a <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j-trump-statement-regarding-tragic-terrorist-attacks" type="external">statement</a> Sunday evening, Trump argued that 99 percent of Afghans were radical Islamists, that Middle Eastern migrants should be kept out of the United States, and that anyone who refused to “say the words ‘Radical Islam’ ” in the hours after the Orlando massacre should be disqualified from the presidency.</p> <p>Trump is a fool. Analysts who see this atrocity as an act of radical Islamic terrorism—and who understand radicalism, Islam, and terrorism far better than Trump does—suspect it was inspired by a <a href="https://pietervanostaeyen.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/al-hayat-that-they-live-by-proof.pdf" type="external">message from ISIS</a>, issued three weeks ago. This elaborate statement, delivered by ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, urged ISIS sympathizers to attack civilians in Europe and the United States during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. It also clarified the group’s propaganda and recruitment strategy. Trump’s platform of banning Muslims, blocking migrants, and ruthlessly bombing ISIS-held territory fits this strategy perfectly. He’s an ISIS stooge.</p> <p>The statement from ISIS, released on May 21, exhorts Muslims to “terrorize” non-Muslims everywhere and to make Ramadan “a month of suffering.” But this plea comes from a position of weakness. The statement says “the whole world has allied and rushed against us,” launching “20,000 airstrikes” and killing several top ISIS leaders. It pledges, defiantly and expectantly, that ISIS won’t quit no matter how much territory it loses.</p> <p>The worst peril, according to the statement, is emerging from within Islam: “Evil scholars” are using “every form of media” to issue “fatwas against the mujahidin.” These scholars, the statement explains, are promoting moderate interpretations of Islamic mercy. They’re denouncing terrorism and condemning ISIS fighters as pseudo-Islamic “renegades.” They’re instructing Muslims to renounce jihad and expel ISIS from their lands. For pages and pages, the statement goes on, lambasting these scholars and the damage they’re doing to public opinion. Clearly, ISIS sees this as a central threat.</p> <p>To quash the threat, ISIS reasserts that “there are only two armies, two camps, two trenches”: Muslims and infidels. There can be no integration, the statement argues—no attempt to “ ‘make peace and mix’ with those who hate the faith.” Muslims must follow ISIS: “We are the People of the Quran.” The statement claims that the armies arrayed against ISIS “wage war against us … because we command the worship of Allah. … This is our religion. For this alone, we fight the world and they fight us.”</p> <p>To prove that the forces arrayed against ISIS are anti-Islamic, and to justify terrorism in Europe and the United States, the statement presents three arguments. First, it says the West doesn’t care about the thousands of Syrian Muslims slaughtered by Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Contrary to our rhetoric about human rights, we’ve ignored Assad’s:</p> <q>
 barrels of death, destruction, and gas. America and its allies do not ache and feel pain, except when [ISIS fighters] advance and gain victories. The world does not weep at the Russian and [Assad] massacres each day against the Muslims. … The people of Europe and other lands of [unbelievers] do not shudder at the Russian destruction of hospitals. </q> <p>Second, the statement accuses us of indifference to Syrians who have fled their homes. “The sentiments in Europe, America, and other disbelieving nations are not moved nor shaken by the displacement of millions,” ISIS argues. “They are not disturbed by the hunger, disease, suffering, and death of thousands of helpless and besieged children, women, and elderly people.”</p> <p>Third, ISIS says it’s OK to kill civilians in non-Muslim countries, because that’s what we do in Muslim countries. The statement instructs ISIS sympathizers abroad:</p> <q>
 It has reached us that some of you do not act due to their incapacity to reach military targets, or their finding fault with targeting those who are called “civilians.” So they [avoid] harming them, doubting the permissibility thereof. Know that inside the lands of the belligerent crusaders, there is no sanctity of blood and no existence of those called “innocents.” … [T]heir warplanes do not distinguish between one who is armed and another who is unarmed, nor between a man and a woman. </q> <p>On each of these three points, Trump’s rhetoric and agenda support ISIS. Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/30/politics/donald-trump-syria-don-lemon/" type="external">backs Russia and Assad</a> in their ruthless assaults on rebellious Syrian population centers. He calls for a “ <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration" type="external">complete shutdown</a>” of migration to the United States, specifically aimed at Muslims. He pledges to “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWejiXvd-P8" type="external">bomb the shit</a>” out of ISIS-held territory and loosen restraints on airstrikes that might kill civilians. He even advocates <a type="internal">targeting the family members</a> of terrorists, regardless of their innocence.</p> <p>Trump also reinforces ISIS’s message that the campaign against it is a war against Islam. His ban on entry to the United States would apply to <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration" type="external">all Muslims</a>, not just to radicals or supporters of terrorism. Three months ago, Trump declared that “ <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1603/09/acd.01.html" type="external">Islam hates us</a>” and refused to distinguish radical Muslims from Muslims in general, arguing that “it's very hard to separate because you don't know who is who.” On Friday, just before the Orlando attack, he told an audience of conservative Christians that he would “defend Christian Americans” and clamp down on the influx of “ <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?410912-4/donald-trump-addresses-faith-freedom-coalition-conference" type="external">Syrian refugees</a>.”</p> <p>In short, Trump would undercut everything that’s working against ISIS: Muslim governments that have joined our military campaign, clerics who are articulating moderate Islam, ministries and activists who are working online to discredit jihadism. He would help ISIS obtain the weapons it needs most: overseas recruits who are willing to kill people in their own countries. He would make another Orlando more likely.</p> <p>Trump thinks his policy of “ <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/742034549232766976" type="external">vigilance</a>” against domestic Muslims would protect us. But that, too, serves the enemy’s agenda. In its Ramadan message, ISIS urged its sympathizers in the West to wage jihad in their own countries, “to make examples of the crusaders, day and night, scaring them and terrorizing them, until every neighbor fears his neighbor.” That’s the purpose of the attacks in Fort Hood, Boston, San Bernardino, and Orlando: to terrorize us, to polarize us, to make every neighbor fear his neighbor.</p> <p>So far, the terrorists haven’t succeeded. But Trump might.</p></article>
	<article id="0000689" published-at="2016-07-19" title="The Most Damning Speech of the GOP Convention"><p>Photo by Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</p> Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani shrieks at delegates during the evening session of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. <p>The 2016 Republican National Convention is a marvel of cognitive dissonance. It seems to have been constructed as though Republicans were nominating a normal presidential candidate. But they aren’t. We keep hearing that the nominee stands for this or has said that—but he doesn’t, and he hasn’t. He’s outside the bounds of presentable behavior. So the party, in its presentation, ignores his record.</p> <p>Take Monday’s speech by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Like previous speakers, he complained that President Obama has failed to identify “our enemy.” Giuliani described this enemy as “Islamic extremist terrorism.” Then he paused to lecture reporters: “For the purpose of the media, I did not say all of Islam. I did not say most of Islam. I said Islamic extremist terrorism.”</p> <p>Well, that’s nice. But it’s not <a type="internal">what Trump has said</a>. Trump has said, “ <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1603/09/acd.01.html" type="external">Islam hates us</a>.” He has proposed a “ <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration" type="external">complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States</a>.” If you don’t like that position, don’t lecture the press. Lecture your nominee.</p> <p>“Donald Trump is a leader,” Giuliani went on. “He will reassert America’s position as the nation with the best values to lead the world.”</p> <p>Really? Trump will show we have the best values to lead the world? Maybe a Republican speaker could have said that about George W. Bush, who at least claimed to fight for democracy. But Trump? Trump’s whole foreign policy is about renouncing values. He says <a type="internal">our scruples weaken us</a> in the fight against ISIS. He says we should <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/17/donald-trump-on-waterboarding-torture-works/" type="external">torture prisoners</a> for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/23/donald-trump-on-waterboarding-if-it-doesnt-work-they-deserve-it-anyway/" type="external">sheer retribution</a>. He says we should <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/12/02/donald-trump-fox-and-friends-we-have-take-out-isis-terrorists-families" type="external">target the families</a> of terrorists. He says we should <a href="https://www.vice.com/read/donald-trump-says-hell-behead-isis-and-steal-their-oil-in-his-first-campaign-video-vgtrn" type="external">seize oil from countries we invade</a>. Take the Ten Commandments, turn them upside down, and that’s pretty much what Trump stands for. You can argue that his foreign policy might scare some countries into bowing to us, as they do when threatened by Russia or China. But values? Please.</p> <p>Giuliani accused Obama of dividing the country over police shootings. He asked: “What happened to ‘There's no black America, no white America, there is just America’?” Speaking for the GOP, Giuliani pledged: “We reach out our arms with understanding and compassion to those who have lost loved ones because of police shootings.”</p> <p>That’s sweet. But maybe, before issuing that pledge, Giuliani should have checked Trump’s Twitter account. He could start with Trump’s tweet that “ <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/342190428675796992" type="external">the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics</a>.” Then perhaps he could move on to Trump’s retweet of a <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/668520614697820160" type="external">fabricated claim</a> that 81 percent of white homicide victims were killed by blacks—followed by Trump’s insistence that the number came “ <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/trump-retweets-bogus-crime-graphic/" type="external">from sources that are very credible</a>.” Then maybe he could peruse Trump’s tweets about the anger over policing in Ferguson, Missouri (“ <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/537245792378294272" type="external">President Obama has absolutely no control [or respect] over the African American community</a>”) and over the death of Freddie Gray (“ <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/592910662424223744" type="external">Our great African American President hasn’t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!</a>”). And for dessert, he could read Trump’s remark, just three weeks ago, that sportscaster Jimmy “the Greek” Snyder <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/columnists/howie_carr/2016/06/carr_nothing_sorry_about_trump_one" type="external">never should have apologized</a> for <a type="internal">racist comments about black athletes</a>. There’s no black America, except in everything Trump says to white America.</p> <p>Giuliani accused the press of misrepresenting Trump:</p> <q>
 This is a man with a big heart who loves people. All people, from the top to the bottom, from the middle to the side. I'm telling you this because I'm sick and tired of the defamation of Donald Trump by the media and by the Clinton campaign. I'm sick and tired of it! </q> <p>Defamation? Rudy, Rudy. Do you not have Internet? Have you ever <a type="internal">watched a video of Trump talking</a>? We’re not his defamers. We’re just his stenographers. We let him talk, and he <a type="internal">shows everyone what’s in that big heart of his</a>. Maybe you should queue up the time he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/us/politics/donald-trump-says-his-mocking-of-new-york-times-reporter-was-misread.html" type="external">ridiculed a disabled journalist</a>. Or the time he said a judge was unfit to hear his case because the judge was “ <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1606/05/sotu.01.html" type="external">of Mexican heritage</a>.” Or the time he pined for the days when protesters would be taken out of rallies “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMg407gaFro" type="external">on a stretcher</a>.” And that’s just a <a type="internal">small sample</a> of <a type="internal">the venom that has oozed out of Trump’s mouth</a>.</p> <p>Here’s the problem, Republicans. Three days from now, this show you’re putting on will be over. All the promises made by people who aren’t Donald Trump will be gone. The only thing you’ll be left with is the guy you actually nominated for president. And what he has said—and continues to say—is so awful that you couldn’t bring yourselves, in four days of talking about him, to face who he really is.</p></article>
	<article id="0000690" published-at="2016-08-03" title="10 Vile Things Donald Trump Has Said Since the GOP Convention"><p>Alex Wong/Getty Images</p> Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at Briar Woods High School on Tuesday in Ashburn, Virginia. <p>Shortly before the Republican National Convention, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he had spoken with Donald Trump <a href="http://www.wsj.com/video/house-speaker-paul-ryan-interview/1D9EFDDF-0A30-4851-A993-28B7DDC419B4.html" type="external">several times</a> about improving his “temperament” and sounding more “inclusive.” In particular, Ryan said he had cautioned Trump about his attack on the ethnic heritage of a Mexican-American judge. NPR’s Steve Inskeep asked Ryan whether he had seen any subsequent changes in Trump’s behavior. Ryan answered: “ <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/07/15/485867040/nprs-interview-with-house-speaker-paul-ryan-on-poverty-and-politics" type="external">I believe he’s going to endeavor, to try</a>.”</p> <p>Nearly two weeks after the convention ended, it’s clear that Trump is unreformed. It’s not just his beef with the parents of a slain soldier: Trump has spurned the Constitution, ridiculed morality, and dished out ethnic, religious, and sexual slurs. As these outbursts have continued, Ryan has spoken out just once, ignoring the rest of Trump’s offenses. He and other Republican leaders continue to support Trump. Here’s what Trump has said and done since the convention while the GOP leadership, for the most part, has looked the other way.</p> <p>1. Smearing a dead soldier’s Muslim mother. During the Iraq war, U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, a Muslim, sacrificed his life to save his fellow American soldiers. This past Thursday, Khan’s father, Khizr Khan, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?412848-102/khizr-khan-remarks-democratic-national-convention" type="external">spoke at the Democratic National Convention</a> and pointed out that under Trump’s proposed Muslim ban, Humayun Khan would not have been allowed into the United States. On Friday, Trump was asked to respond in an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-vice-president-joe-biden/story?id=41020870" type="external">interview with ABC News</a>. Trump immediately changed the subject to Khan’s mother, Ghazala Khan, who had stood beside her husband during the DNC speech, wearing a hijab. “She had nothing to say,” Trump pointed out. “She probably—maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say.”</p> <p>Trump was wrong: As Ghazala Khan explained in interviews and a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ghazala-khan-donald-trump-criticized-my-silence-he-knows-nothing-about-true-sacrifice/2016/07/31/c46e52ec-571c-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html" type="external">op-ed</a>, she hadn’t spoken at the convention because it’s emotionally difficult for her to talk about her son’s death. Trump simply assumed, based on her faith and appearance, that she was being oppressed. Presented with a Muslim man who had given his life for America, Trump focused not on the soldier’s uniform but on his mother’s hijab. And rather than praise Humayun Khan for thwarting a bomber, Trump shifted to a cultural critique of Muslims, the same critique Trump has been <a type="internal">peddling since mid-June</a>. This episode makes it clear that Trump’s animus against Islam transcends the issue of terrorism.</p> <p>2. Resisting religious nondiscrimination. After Trump <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration" type="external">proposed his Muslim ban</a> in December, some Republicans warned him that discrimination on the basis of faith was un-American. They advised him to apply his immigration restrictions to countries rather than a religion. Trump is trying to comply with that advice legally, but he has signaled that he hates it and that he doesn’t understand why Muslims can’t be excluded as a class.</p> <p>In a July 24 interview on <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-july-24-2016-n615706" type="external">Meet the Press</a>, Trump mocked his critics: “People were so upset when I used the word ‘Muslim.’ Ooooh, you can’t use the word ‘Muslim.’ “ He went on: “Our Constitution is great. But it doesn’t necessarily give us the right to commit suicide.” Trump has since repeated that criticism of the Constitution at campaign rallies. On July 28, Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade asked Trump whether he had “clarified” that his ban wouldn’t cover all Muslims. Trump replied noncommittally: “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHbm4pcKxdo" type="external">We’re going to territories. We’ll see</a>.” In an interview on Monday, Sean Hannity pointed out that nearly all Syrian refugees recently admitted to the United States were Muslims. He asked Trump whether this meant that U.S. officials were discriminating against Christians. Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCuCCrG9Q7M" type="external">answered</a>:</p> <q>
 In my opinion, they are. But we don’t take care of the Christians. You know, before the migration, a friend of mine [said that if] you come from Syria, if you’re Muslim, it’s one of the easiest places to come into the United States from. If you’re Christian, it’s impossible, virtually impossible to come into the United States. Very unfair. </q> <p>It’s worth pointing out that Trump, while complaining that too many Muslims are theocratic, has no problem with Jews or Christians who claim divine authority for government. At a campaign event in Roanoke, Virginia, on July 25, a questioner asked Trump: “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGcveNDzvE" type="external">Will you stand by Israel 100 percent and do whatever it takes to preserve the nation of God?</a>“ Trump, without hesitation, replied, “100 percent.”</p> <p>3. Advocating punishment of Muslim communities. At a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?413263-1/donald-trump-urges-russia-find-hillary-clinton-emails-criticizes-record-tpp" type="external">press conference</a> near Miami on July 27, Trump declared Muslim neighbors and congregants responsible for terrorism in the United States. “I think that the people in the community know what’s going on, whether it’s in a mosque or it’s in the community. And they have to report these people,” said Trump. At the press conference and at subsequent rallies in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ato3Deo5n4" type="external">Cedar Rapids, Iowa</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKdeavP1Juw" type="external">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a>, Trump specifically alleged—contrary to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/trump-falsely-claims-muslims-knew-in-advance-of-san-bernardi" type="external">fact checks</a> that have found <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/06/donald-trump-on-orlando-shooting/" type="external">no evidence for his claims</a>—that prior to December’s terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, neighbors of the plotters saw bombs lying all over the floor of their apartment but didn’t report them. In his Iowa speech, Trump issued a warning to Muslims: “If a community isn’t going to report when they know something’s going to happen, those people have to suffer the consequences.”</p> <p>4. Likening his business career to losing a child in war. In the ABC interview, Trump was asked about Khizr Khan’s charge that Trump had “sacrificed nothing and no one” for his country. Trump shot back: “Who wrote that? Did Hillary’s scriptwriter write it?” (Actually, Khan <a type="internal">wrote it himself</a>.) Then Trump—who had used <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html" type="external">five draft deferments</a> to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-in-2004-on-stds-and-dating-its-like-vietnam-and" type="external">avoid service in Vietnam</a>—boasted, “I have made a lot of sacrifices. I’ve worked very, very hard. I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I’ve had tremendous success.”</p> <p>While depicting his accumulation of wealth as heroic, Trump mocks people who take physical risks. His foot-dragging in acknowledging the sacrifice of Humayun Khan is just one example. Last year, Trump dismissed Sen. John McCain’s ordeal as a POW in Vietnam. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-18/trump-on-john-mccain-i-like-people-that-weren-t-captured-okay-" type="external">scoffed</a>. “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, OK?” More recently, Trump has ridiculed another Vietnam veteran, Secretary of State John Kerry, for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-kerry-accident-idUSKBN0OG0B420150531" type="external">breaking his leg</a> in a bicycle accident. At two rallies last week, Trump raised his hand and offered a sarcastic pledge: “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN_3OqdZUIk" type="external">I give you my word, I will never enter a bicycle competition as long as I’m president</a>.”</p> <p>5. Using war to steal wealth. In his convention speech, Khizr Khan said his son “sacrificed his life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers.” He advised to Trump to visit Arlington National Cemetery and “look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America.” Trump, however, sees war as a <a type="internal">business proposition</a>. At his rally in Roanoke, and later during a speech in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said the United States should have seized Iraq’s oil. “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN_3OqdZUIk" type="external">Take the oil! Take the oil!</a>“ Trump shouted at the crowd in Toledo. “To the victor belong the spoils!”</p> <p>6. Rejecting military ethics. Khizr Khan brandished a copy of the Constitution and spoke of American values. Trump accepts no such restraints. Throughout his campaign, Trump has <a type="internal">defended torture and the deliberate targeting of family members</a> of terrorists. Since the convention, he has escalated his rhetoric. At several rallies, Trump derided his vanquished primary opponents for agonizing over whether to permit waterboarding. Trump told crowds that he, unlike his opponents, had no qualms. “I wouldn’t even think about it. Absolutely,” he bragged in Cedar Rapids.</p> <p>Trump’s view is that the United States should behave no better than ISIS because scruples are a disadvantage. In Cedar Rapids, he complained that ISIS drowns and decapitates people, while “we’re playing by different rules.” In Harrisburg, he objected again to following a “different set of rules. They can chop off heads, they can drown people, they can bury you in sand. And we can’t waterboard. … It’s very hard when you’re not playing on a level playing field, folks.”</p> <p>7. Glorifying success at other people’s expense. Trump often boasts that he sucked profit out of properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, leaving <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-candidate-wealth-2016-213362" type="external">investors, contractors, and taxpayers</a> holding the tab. Now he’s bragging about a <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/donald-trump-candidate-wealth-2016-213362" type="external">Cincinnati apartment complex</a> that sank into hard times after he sold it. “I had great success,” he told a crowd in Columbus, Ohio, on Monday:</p> <q>
 We bought it from HUD and turned it around. … And then we sold it at a tremendous profit, and we went on to the next. … After I sold it, the job went very bad. The job went very bad. I mean, it went—My timing was very good. … The timing was beautiful. … It lost a lot of its occupants. That’s how the timing was. It was, like, perfect timing. </q> <p>Congratulations, Donald. Ohioans suffered, but you pocketed the cash.</p> <p>8. Challenging the legitimacy of American elections. In Columbus, Trump told his followers, “I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged.” The next day, at a rally in Ashburn, Virginia, he claimed that a “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARSzEKEsCwY" type="external">crooked system</a>“—apparently, the FBI—had allowed Hillary Clinton to “get away with” abuse of a private email server. In interviews with Hannity and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-new-rigged-system-the-election-itself/2016/08/02/d9fb33b0-58c4-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html" type="external">Washington Post</a>, Trump also criticized recent court rulings against voter ID requirements, predicted fraud, and specifically cited precincts that recorded “ <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-rigged-election-226588" type="external">practically nobody</a>“ voting for Mitt Romney in 2012.</p> <p>Trump didn’t make the connection explicit, but the context of his insinuations is racial. He raised his criticism of the courts three days after the Fourth Circuit struck down a North Carolina voter ID law for managing to ” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/us/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolina-voter-id-provision.html" type="external">target African-Americans with almost surgical precision</a>.” The precinct results to which Trump alluded were in black neighborhoods of <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20121112_In_59_Philadelphia_voting_wards__Mitt_Romney_got_zero_votes.html" type="external">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/11/cuyahoga_county_precinct_map_s.html#incart_river" type="external">Cleveland</a>, and other cities. He offered no evidence of fraud, and post-election analyses have found that the recorded results in these precincts are <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/trumps-faulty-rigged-reasoning/" type="external">perfectly plausible</a>. But that hasn’t stopped Trump and his advisers from suggesting that a Trump defeat, by itself, would <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/07/29/roger-stone-milo-show-trump-can-fight-voter-fraud/" type="external">prove the election was stolen</a>. As Trump put it to Hannity: “That election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it’s going to be taken away from us.”</p> <p>9. Injecting race into the Russia debate. At his Miami press conference, Trump said he would be better than Obama at improving relations with Russia:</p> <q>
 Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things, OK? He mentioned the N word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the N word. You know what the N word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked. He has a total lack of respect for President Obama. No. 1, he doesn’t like him, and No. 2, he doesn’t respect him. I think he’s going to respect your president if I’m elected. And I hope he likes me. </q> <p>There’s no evidence Putin has ever used that word, much less that he applied it to Obama. But the notion that Putin has used it, or must have used it, has <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/07/27/donald-trump-thinks-he-heard-vladimir-putin-call-barack-obama-the-n-word-he-didnt/" type="external">floated around right-wing circles</a> for some time. Trump’s defenders creatively plead that by “N word,” he might have been referring to Putin’s talk of deploying nuclear weapons against ISIS. But as Slate’s Jeremy Stahl has <a type="internal">explained</a>, that interpretation makes no sense: Trump has said the same thing, so he wouldn’t call such a comment bad or shocking. After the press conference, Stahl asked the Trump campaign to clarify Trump’s meaning. To this day, the campaign hasn’t responded.</p> <p>Trump’s remarks about Putin echo his previous remarks about women. In 2013, Trump wrote that integrating women into the military was “ <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331909758028222466" type="external">dumb</a>“ because it <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/331907383771148288" type="external">resulted in sexual assaults</a>. His approach in both cases is the same: If somebody disrespects or abuses you because of your sex or race, Trump thinks the solution is to remove you.</p> <p>10. Raising backlash as an argument against a female president. Trump has <a type="internal">repeatedly invoked Obama’s race</a> in tweets against the president. In 2014, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/537157586316165120" type="external">warned</a>: “Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won’t see another black president for generations!” Now Trump is using the same pitch against Clinton. At a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEWni84PA1k" type="external">rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania</a>, on July 27, he warned women not to make Clinton the first female president: “She’ll set you back a long way, women, if that happens! It’ll be a long way before it happens again. You better be careful what you wish for.”</p> <p>Trump has also attacked Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, but his angle against her is ethnic, not sexual. At least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKwWwSFmhqw" type="external">nine times</a> since the Democratic convention, at rallies <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/756801575193042944" type="external">and</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/757775689525309440" type="external">in</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/757919034755076096" type="external">tweets</a>, Trump has called Warren “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGcveNDzvE" type="external">Pocahontas</a>.” The context is complicated: Warren’s purported Native American heritage is unverified, but it also seems to have been a nonfactor in her career. Nevertheless, Trump, who has a <a type="internal">record</a> of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-06-30/trump-deals-elizabeth-warren-the-race-card" type="external">mocking Native American claims</a>, calls her “Pocahontas” to flaunt his disdain for political correctness.</p> <p>Trump’s behavior since his convention shows that nothing has changed. Whatever Ryan said to him has had no effect. Trump continues to use religion, race, and gender as political weapons. He spurns American values, military values, and common decency. Occasional dissents, such as Ryan’s statement of <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/statement-house-speaker-paul-ryan" type="external">support for the Khan family</a>, won’t cut it. Trump is comprehensively vile. If you stand with him, Mr. Speaker, you stand for nothing.</p></article>
	<article id="0000691" published-at="2016-08-30" title="What Black People Hear When Donald Trump Asks for Their Vote"><p>Timothy A. Clary/Getty Images</p> The Rev. Mark Burns arrives at Trump Tower for a meeting with Donald Trump in New York City on Nov. 30, 2015. <p>To the extent that Donald Trump is reaching out to black Americans, his pitch relies on a bleak vision of black life in the United States and an attack on Democratic Party leadership in those same cities. “Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/770247094439469058" type="external">tweeted</a> Trump on Monday. “Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary-type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/770253550639251456" type="external">they want TRUMP</a>!”</p> <p>So far, there is no groundswell of black enthusiasm for Trump. He wins 8 percent of black voters in the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-faces-hurdle-minority-voters-clinton-maintains-lead-poll-shows-n636061" type="external">latest poll</a> from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal; he wins 5 percent in the <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2016/08/28/trump-gains-ground-clinton-black-voters-still-wary/" type="external">latest survey</a> from Morning Consult; and he wins just 3.6 percent in the <a href="http://polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_DS_13/filters/SC_RACE:2/dates/20160710-20160826/type/smallest" type="external">latest poll</a> from Reuters/Ipsos. In critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, he wins a statistically negligible share of the black vote, i.e. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-polls-at-zero-black-swing-state-voters_us_5787f375e4b0867123e0681b" type="external">zero percent</a>.</p> <p>In a sign of confidence, however, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0" type="external">Trump plans to take his message to Detroit</a>, where he’ll hold his first event in a predominantly black community, speaking with Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of Great Faith Ministries. There’s a strong chance he’ll stick to his present pitch, even as it lands flat with the vast majority of black voters.</p> <p>That fact—black indifference or even antipathy to Trump and his rhetoric—deserves a little more attention. It’s not that black voters are hostile to Trump; it’s that they won’t even entertain his basic message. There’s nothing he could say or do in the realm of possibility that would budge his numbers away from historic lows, much less restore them to the double digits enjoyed by George W. Bush in <a href="http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2004/" type="external">the 2004 election</a>. Given the real problems facing black voters—including higher rates of joblessness and criminal victimization—why aren’t they receptive to Trump’s message?</p> <p>The simple answer is that it’s patronizing, ahistorical nonsense that’s not at all unique to Trump. The problem goes beyond the mere optics of his “outreach”—producing dystopian portraits of black life for predominantly white audiences. And it’s not just the extent to which Trump is talking about black Americans rather than to them. The central issue is that Trump portrays black Americans not as able citizens who need to be convinced, but as mindless followers of a failed regime.</p> <p>“The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty,” Trump said in a <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439152/donald-trump-black-voter-outreach-democrats-have-failed-black-americans" type="external">recent speech</a> in Milwaukee. He continued: “The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin. They’ve ruined the schools. They’ve driven out the jobs. They’ve tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.”</p> <p>In this narrative, black Americans are mere objects—means to a partisan end. They do not choose or act as political agents. There are no black politicians or activists or leaders of any stripe. Instead, they are acted upon, tools of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. And worse, despite the horrors of Democratic governance, they don’t understand that they’ve been used and “betrayed.” They still vote for Democrats in overwhelming numbers. They are dupes.</p> <p>Trump’s argument isn’t new. It is de rigueur among conservative personalities to blame the Republican Party’s poor performance with black voters on a “plantation mentality,” in which blacks are kept hopelessly dependent on government benefits and the Democratic Party that peddles them. The goal: to keep black Americans from grasping the truth that prosperity comes from “liberty” and free markets. You can hear this perspective throughout right-wing media, from <a href="http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/06/09/foxs-stacey-dash-democratic-plantation-mentality-keeping-african-americans-entitlements/210850" type="external">Fox News</a> and popular websites like <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/starparker/2009/02/09/back_on_uncle_sams_plantation" type="external">Townhall</a>, to films like Dinesh D’Souza’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438016/hillarys-america-dinesh-dsouza-democrats-racist-past-corrupt-present" type="external">Hillary’s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party</a> and Pritchett Cotten’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55aujTwuJY8" type="external">Runaway Slave</a>, a documentary that claims to show how “people can break free from a form of modern slavery caused by relying on welfare,” and in which a black conservative—the Rev. C.L. Bryant—is the titular “runaway slave” who escapes the implied Democratic “plantation.”</p> <p>Key to the “plantation” theory is the idea that modern Democrats are direct heirs to the white supremacist Democratic Party of the 19th and early 20th centuries. For proponents, it is a straight line from John C. Calhoun to Jefferson Davis to Theodore Bilbo to Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. You hear this in Trump’s rhetoric as well. “We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton,” he <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-remarks-in-milwaukee-wisconsin" type="external">has said</a>, “which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.” Whereas Bilbo relied on terrorism to suppress blacks, modern Democrats use the welfare state to achieve the same ends. And the apex of this arrangement is in the inner cities governed for generations by ruinous Democratic policies.</p> <p>These narratives and arguments are bizarre to the point of incoherence, a fourth-rate imitation of history, devoid of any actual meaning. Shaped, influenced, and even driven by black Americans in the middle of the 20th century, the modern Democratic Party is not the literal descendant of the white supremacist party that bore the name for a century; in much of the modern-day South, black Americans are the Democratic Party. Black Americans have had an active role in Democratic Party politics for two generations, culminating in the election of Barack Obama, a black American. More broadly, blacks have not been led astray—they are not victims of false consciousness or some “plantation mentality.” They are political actors making choices based on their interests as they see them.</p> <p>Likewise, the issues in urban America aren’t the product of the Democratic Party or the black mayors and city councilors who took the reins of the cities in the 1970s and 1980s. The decline of Detroit or Cleveland or Baltimore didn’t begin in 1967. Instead, they’re the cumulative result of a century of policies, from redlining and housing discrimination to white flight, federal neglect, and ongoing hostility from surrounding municipalities. There’s no question that these cities have been marred by bad governance, but to understand that in terms of party affiliation—neglecting the effects of deindustrialization, racism, and capital flight—is to show profound ignorance of urban politics and problems.</p> <p>Blacks are not victims of false consciousness or some “plantation mentality.” They are political actors making choices based on their interests as they see them.</p> <p>Beyond incoherent, the ideas underlying Trump’s narrative are racist, full stop. If “plantation” theory is true, then black voters are the mindless drones of American politics. Nefarious Democrats gave them a taste of government, and they never abandoned the hand that fed them. White voters, by contrast, are active citizens—noble republicans in the best tradition of the founders. It’s ironic: For as much as they disdain Democrats as the real racists, it’s the proponents of plantation theory who <a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2008661698/" type="external">echo the arguments and propaganda</a> of the pro-Southern, anti-emancipation Democrats of the Civil War era. “The Freedman's Bureau!” sang one poster from the 1866 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, advocating on behalf of Hiester Clymer and his white-supremacist platform. “An agency to keep the Negro in idleness at the expense of the white man.”</p> <p>What’s key is that black voters hear this sentiment in the rhetoric used by Trump and other conservatives. It’s one reason that, despite having been peddled in its current incarnation by black conservatives and their allies for the better part of a decade, the argument has never gotten any traction.</p> <p>The other reason is Barack Obama. Tens of millions of black Americans hold the president and his family in high esteem as exemplars of the black community. For them, he deserves respect regardless of your politics. And if there’s anything that defines the GOP in the present age for black voters, it’s the outsized disrespect for Obama, from South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson’s “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgce06Yw2ro" type="external">you lie</a>” to the birther crusade pursued so vigorously by Trump and others. Black Americans see this, and they remember.</p> <p>Somewhere in the multiverse is a world where black voters have warmed to Donald Trump. It’s not this one. In this world, for blacks to reconsider Trump and the Republican Party, they would have to ignore his birtherism; they would have to ignore the push for voter ID and the attacks on civil rights legislation; they would have to downplay the patronizing “outreach” of conservative voices and Republican politicians. For blacks to reconsider Trump, they would have to act as if they were the dupes of his imagination.</p></article>
	<article id="0000692" published-at="2016-09-13" title="Trump’s Campaign Against Clinton Is an Exercise in Projection"><p>Gary Gershoff/Getty Images for Cantor Fitzgerald</p> Presidential candidate and gifted projector Donald Trump in New York City on Monday. <p>“She is trigger-happy and very unstable, whether we like it or not, that’s what’s going on,” said Donald Trump of Hillary Clinton <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-unstable-227835" type="external">during a speech</a> on foreign policy last week. She’s “also reckless, so reckless, in fact, that she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack and probably have.”</p> <p>“Trigger-happy.” “Unstable.” “Reckless.” All of this coming from a candidate who recently said <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-trump-iranian-soldiers-who-harass-u-s-1473472852-htmlstory.html" type="external">this</a> about tensions with Iran: “With Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn’t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water.”</p> <p>Trump isn’t making an argument about his opponent; he’s projecting, and in the race against Clinton, it is a defining aspect of Donald Trump’s rhetoric. Rather than challenge the Democratic presidential nominee on substance, Trump takes an approach familiar to anyone who has spent time on an elementary school playground. I know you are, but what am I?</p> <p>Take this <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/767704684601741313" type="external">response</a> to the hosts of Fox and Friends, from an August discussion of Clinton’s email practices: “Well, look, she’s a liar. I mean, she lies. She lied about the email. She lied about Colin Powell. I saw that. He was not happy and it’s—the whole thing is a scam with them. Everything is a scam, like grifters.”</p> <p>As with most Trump rhetoric, this is worth a fact-check. Few politicians are completely honest, but compared with her peers, Clinton is less likely to make false statements, as <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/comparing-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-truth-o-met/" type="external">judged by Politifact</a>. And to that point, the <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/09/14-excerpts-fbis-report-hillary-clintons-email" type="external">FBI investigation</a> of Clinton’s private server—as well as documentary evidence such as the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-powell-hillary-clinton-email_us_57c9cf7ee4b078581f130530" type="external">correspondence</a> between Clinton and Powell—supports the Democratic nominee’s version of events. Trump, put simply, is wrong.</p> <p>But that’s not the projection. The projection is the claim that, with Bill and Hillary Clinton, “Everything is a scam, like grifters.” At present, at least three of Trump’s endeavors are under investigation or serious scrutiny—Trump University, Trump Institute, and the Trump Foundation. All of them have the makings of scams, from dishonest business practices to the use of <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/9/13/12888492/trump-foundation" type="external">ostensibly charitable dollars</a> for personal expenses. And this doesn’t include Trump’s real estate career, rife with stories of exploitation, wage theft, and borderline fraud.</p> <p>Trump takes an approach familiar to anyone who has spent time on a playground. I know you are, but what am I?</p> <p>Trump has projected more than just behavior onto his opponent; he’s projected his entire approach to politics. After Clinton detailed Trump’s ties to white nationalists and other hate groups, Trump gave a response, essentially turning her claim on its head. “She is a bigot because you look at what’s happening to the inner cities, you look at what’s happening to African Americans and Hispanics in this country where she talks all the time,” <a type="internal">Trump said to CNN’s Anderson Cooper</a>. Asked if he thinks Clinton is “personally” prejudiced, Trump replied: “Well, she is, of course she is. Her policies—they’re her policies, she comes out with the policies and others that believe like she does also. … This is over the years, a long time. She’s totally bigoted, there’s no question about that.”</p> <p>Keep in mind that this comes from a candidate who began his campaigns suggesting that some number of Mexican immigrants were “rapists,” whose signature policies are a wall on the Mexican border and a ban on Muslim immigration, and whose “ <a type="internal">outreach</a>” to black voters involves grossly exaggerated depictions of black life that rely on racist tropes about black criminality.</p> <p>One especially egregious instance of this projection came on Monday, during a rally in Asheville, North Carolina. Responding to Clinton’s claim that “half of Trump supporters” are in a “basket of deplorables,” the Republican presidential nominee <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/12/trump-says-clinton-running-hate-filled-campaign-at-tense-north-carolina-rally-where-violence-flares-up/" type="external">said this</a>:</p> <q>
 Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent’s campaign of hate. Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign, with no policy, no solutions and no new ideas. </q> <q>
 By contrast, I’ve been going around the country offering very detailed plans for reform and change. All of these reform plans are available on our website, and they’re extensive, but we have no choice. </q> <p>This is almost unbelievable. In his acceptance address to the Republican National Convention and in his recent speech to supporters in Phoenix, Trump painted a dark, dystopian picture of an America rendered prostrate by crime, violence, and disorder. In Trump’s America, “illegal immigrants” roam streets, killing innocents and destroying families. His is a country where all leaders are corrupt, all institutions are rigged, and he is the only savior.</p> <p>“Hate-filled and negative” is a straightforward description of Trump’s campaign, and it was especially apt in Asheville, where a Trump supporter <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/12/trump-says-clinton-running-hate-filled-campaign-at-tense-north-carolina-rally-where-violence-flares-up/" type="external">attacked</a> a protester.</p> <p>Likewise, the Trump campaign is notable for its indifference to public policy. Trump has little grasp of basic details and is unable to articulate—in any detail—his plans for anything on his agenda. Clinton, by contrast, has released a 300-page book dedicated to her policy agenda. Overall, <a href="http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/4b32e354f90741f5bbe01cc605b73d0c/trumps-deportation-waffle-highlights-campaign-weaknesses" type="external">according</a> to the Associated Press, Trump’s campaign has released around 9,000 words in policy papers, compared with more than 112,000 from Clinton’s campaign.</p> <p>This projection is such a regular part of Trump’s message that it begins to feel like strategy, as if Trump and his team aren’t running a campaign for the presidency so much as gaslighting the country. And there’s no sign he plans to stop.</p> <p>On Tuesday, at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, he fed the audience red meat with a <a href="https://twitter.com/sopandeb/status/775764195266600961" type="external">full-throated attack</a> on the Democratic nominee. “Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, and only hatred and derision.”</p> <p>He can’t be serious.</p></article>
	<article id="0000693" published-at="2016-10-10" title="Banana Republican"><p>Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</p> Donald Trump at the second presidential debate Sunday. <p>ST. LOUIS—The most important part of Sunday night’s presidential debate happened within the first 20 minutes. The rest wasn’t uninteresting—at one point, Donald Trump <a type="internal">confessed to not paying income taxes</a>, at another <a type="internal">broke with his running mate on what to do in Syria</a>—but it wasn’t vital. It wasn’t, and shouldn’t be, the chief takeaway.</p> <p>The honor goes to the first major moment of the debate. That’s where, after a lengthy exchange, a menacing and almost unhinged Trump threatened to put Clinton in prison should he win the White House in November. Even in a campaign in which Republican crowds chant “lock her up” and Trump surrogates play-act anti-Clinton tribunals, it was extraordinary and disturbing. The behavior of a despot, not of a president.</p> <p>The ramp-up to this was revelatory. Trump was cornered, and he responded with a burst of banana-republic machismo, vowing to investigate and prosecute a political opponent using the powers of his office. It was a remarkable moment: a presidential nominee promising to rip up the foundations of liberal democracy for the sake of getting off a good attack line.</p> <p>It began with the first question. One of the two moderators, CNN’s Anderson Cooper, asked Trump to account for the now-infamous tape in which the Republican nominee claims to “grab” women “by the pussy,” bragging about sexual assault. Trump called it “locker room talk” and tried to pivot to ISIS. Cooper stopped him and pressed him on the question, which he tried to avoid. Trump returned to his campaign slogan—“We’re going to make America great again”—and Cooper turned the question over to Clinton, who hit one of her themes.</p> <p>“Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander in chief,” said Clinton, before rattling off the laundry list of groups that Trump has attacked and insulted over the course of the campaign. He responded—“It’s just words, folks. Just words.”—and the moderators brought the debate back to audience questions, including one submitted online. This one also focused on the tape. “When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man, or did that behavior continue until just recently?” Again, Trump called this “locker room talk.” But then he went in a different direction, one presaged by both his Friday night apology video and an <a type="internal">unusual pre-debate “press conference” involving three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault</a>.</p> <p>“There’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women,” said Trump of the former president. “You can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.” He continued, tying Hillary to her husband’s history with women. “Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.”</p> <p>Clinton had a chance to respond, and she did, again reciting Trump’s attacks on a variety of groups and individuals, from the Khan family—whose son died fighting in Iraq—and Judge Gonzalo Curiel, to President Obama, whom Trump repeatedly attacked as illegitimate on the basis of his birth.</p> <p>It’s at this juncture that the Republican nominee—already teetering on the edge of decorum—went off the rails. He accused Clinton of starting the “birther” conspiracy; he questioned her friendship with Michelle Obama; he accused Clinton of rigging the Democratic primary to rob Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders of the election; and he slammed her for her emails, all leading to an explosion of contempt and menace.</p> <p>“If I win,” said Trump, “I’m going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there’s never been so many lies, so much deception.” He continued: “[W]e’re going to get a special prosecutor because people have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you’ve done.” And when Clinton gave her response—“It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law of our country”—Trump jumped in with a quip.</p> <p>“Because you’d be in jail.”</p> <p>There’s no charitable read here, or at least not one that respects the rules and structure of the English language. Trump’s meaning is plain. Should he win the Oval Office, he will use his authority vis-à-vis the Justice Department to launch an investigation of his rival in the presidential election. And because he believes Clinton uniquely perfidious, this investigation would lead to her prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment. As he said, she would be in jail.</p> <p>Historians, commentators, and “Never Trump” Republicans quickly grasped the weight of his statement. “Only time I’ve ever heard a candidate threatening to jail his opponent was in the Congo. He lost &amp;amp; was later convicted of war crimes,” <a href="https://twitter.com/stuartpstevens/status/785316266017980416" type="external">tweeted</a> former Mitt Romney campaign manager Stuart Stevens. On television, CBS’s Bob Schieffer <a href="https://twitter.com/julianborger/status/785314101077667840" type="external">said</a> Trump’s threat reminded him of a “banana republic.” And University of Virginia historian Nicole Hemmer <a href="https://twitter.com/pastpunditry/status/785331427588005889" type="external">stressed</a> that this was a “breathtaking violation of our democratic tradition.”</p> <p>She’s right. The United States is not a perfect democracy. But one thing we can say is that, in America, political opponents are just that: political opponents. They aren’t hounded and they aren’t imprisoned. It isn’t a crime to be on the other side of an election. To go down that road is to take a shortcut to despotism and repression.</p> <p>On Sunday, to an audience of tens of millions of Americans, Trump voiced his contempt for the norms that define and safeguard our democracy with a promise to jail his chief political opponent. This, again, was the most important moment of the debate. Nothing else—not Clinton’s poor answers for her private speeches, nor Trump’s abject ignorance—comes close. And it’s all the more important given Trump’s larger platform. If elected, the Republican would use the force of the state against nonwhites and religious minorities, from forced deportations of unauthorized Hispanic immigrants to surveillance of Muslim Americans and a return to <a type="internal">stop-and-frisk</a>. Trump already promises an authoritarian state for millions of Americans. This statement—planned and strategically deployed—just shows the scope of his vision.</p> <p>In all of this, it’s worth noting the complicity of the GOP leadership. An hour after Trump promised to jail his opponent if elected president, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus praised his nominee’s performance. “Hillary Clinton spent the night struggling to defender her failed record,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Reince/status/785319272620974080" type="external">he said on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>American democracy needs two healthy parties, at least, to survive and to thrive. Sunday showed we have just one.</p></article>
	<article id="0000694" published-at="2016-10-10" title="A Preview of a Despot"><p>Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</p> Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during Sunday's town hall in St. Louis. <p>In a normal presidential election, debates are a chance to compare two plausible candidates. This isn’t a normal election. If you chatter about who won or lost on points, you’re missing the story. The story in these debates is that the public is getting a chance to see, before it happens, what it would be like to have Donald Trump as president. It would be one of the most dangerous crises in the history of the United States.</p> <p>The first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on Sept. 26, exposed Trump’s views on <a type="internal">financial and civic responsibility</a>. He advocated tax avoidance, international theft, stiffing vendors and creditors, exploiting the misfortunes of others, and deploying the military as a global protection racket. Viewers got a chance to see that Trump was no ordinary crook. He completely lacks a conscience.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/transcript-second-debate.html" type="external">second debate</a>, held on Sunday, exposed Trump’s views on human rights, civil rights, and the rule of law. Essentially, he doesn’t believe in them.</p> <p>The debate opened with a question about role-modeling. CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump about the recently disclosed 2005 video in which Trump bragged about using his star power to grope women. “You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals,” said Cooper. “That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?”</p> <p>Trump dismissed his taped comments as “locker-room talk.” Then, without missing a beat, he continued:</p> <q>
 We have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads. … And they look at our country and they see what’s going on. Yes, I’m very embarrassed by it [the video]. I hate it. But it’s locker-room talk, and it’s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. … We’re going to have borders in our country, which we don’t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they’re coming in from the Middle East and other places. </q> <p>Why did Trump answer a question about sexual assault by pledging to block refugees and knock the hell out of ISIS? Because to him, it’s all about power. He’s proud of the macho image in the tape, even if he regrets that his language was graphic enough to hurt him politically. The guy who talks big in the locker room is the guy we can count on to break some heads.</p> <p>Half an hour later, a Muslim woman asked the candidates, “How will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country?” Trump answered her by repeating his slander that “in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment” of the terrorists before they struck last December. This claim has been <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/salvadorhernandez/trump-falsely-claims-muslims-knew-in-advance-of-san-bernardi" type="external">debunked</a> so many <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2016/06/donald-trump-on-orlando-shooting/" type="external">times</a> that there’s no longer an innocent explanation for Trump’s continued use of it. “Muslims have to report the problems when they see them,” said Trump. He didn’t mention, but also didn’t renounce, his <a type="internal">threat to punish all Muslims</a> for attacks like the one in San Bernardino. (“If a community isn’t going to report when they know something’s going to happen, those people have to suffer the consequences,” Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy6jbzmbo5U" type="external">told a crowd in Ohio</a> on Aug. 1.)</p> <p>Nor did Trump renounce his proposal to <a type="internal">ban Muslims from entering the United States</a>. Twice, ABC’s Martha Raddatz asked Trump whether “the Muslim ban still stands” or “is no longer your position.” Trump refused to say yes or no. Instead, he said his plan had “morphed into extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.” Raddatz also asked Trump whether it was “a mistake to have a religious test.” Trump didn’t answer.</p> <p>Trump called for more military collaboration with Russia (whose invasion of Ukraine he has previously <a type="internal">defended</a>) and opposed aid to rebels who are fighting Russian forces in Syria. He asserted, contrary to the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national" type="external">assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies</a>, that Clinton “doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking” of American email accounts and Web sites to influence our election. In fact, Trump ventured, “Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia.”</p> <p>Raddatz noted that Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, “said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.” Pence’s statement was conservative orthodoxy, but Trump rejected it. “I disagree,” said Trump. Presented with a choice between Russian and anti-Russian foreign policy, Trump chose Russia. Vladimir Putin is Trump’s spiritual running mate.</p> <p>Trump doesn’t just admire Putin. He emulates him. Like Putin, Trump <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/2016-donald-trump-constitution-guide-unconstitutional-freedom-liberty-khan-214139" type="external">threatens journalists</a>. Like Putin, he preaches “law and order” while <a type="internal">encouraging mob violence</a>. Like Putin, Trump says he can <a type="internal">order the military to deliberately kill civilians</a>. And like Putin, he <a type="internal">refuses to tell voters what kind of wars he would wage</a> as president. In Sunday’s debate, Trump rebuffed questions about what he would do in Syria, arguing that to disclose his plans would tip off the enemy. While praising Putin, Trump ridiculed the U.S. government for its transparency. “How stupid is our country?” he asked.</p> <p>One of Putin’s goals in hacking U.S. government websites is to discredit our electoral process. He would like to destabilize American democracy. Trump has aided this project by warning that the election is “ <a type="internal">rigged</a>.” In the debate, Trump piled on, claiming that Clinton had cheated Bernie Sanders out of the Democratic nomination. But that was nothing. A few minutes later, Trump went full Putin. He threatened not just to defeat Clinton, but to imprison her.</p> <p>“If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,” Trump told Clinton. Twice more, he repeated the threat: “We’re going to have a special prosecutor.” Clinton, marveling at this outburst, expressed relief “that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.” To which Trump retorted: “Because you’d be in jail.”</p> <p>These are norms we don’t openly trash in the United States in the 21st century. We don’t settle political disputes by jailing opponents. We don’t dismiss election results and promote political violence. We don’t serve and emulate dictators. We don’t suspend the civil liberties of minorities. We don’t worship men who abuse women and brag about it. Occasionally, we’ve crossed some of these lines. But no major-party presidential nominee has so baldly renounced them.</p> <p>For 240 years, Americans worked, fought, and died to get us this far. We could blow it all in a day. That’s what I saw in this debate. I hope enough of our countrymen did, too.</p></article>
	<article id="0000695" published-at="2016-06-13" title="Trump’s Fearmongering, Hate-Filled Speech on Orlando Is the Scariest Thing He’s Done Yet"><p>Every time a mass shooting occurs in the United States, commentators note how scary it is that we’ve almost become numb to them. But the past year has proven that we also risk becoming numb to another grave threat to America and the world: Donald Trump. His behavior in the past 36 hours has been so horrifically grotesque in so many different ways that it is easy to become emotionally immune to his hideous and bigoted comments, and the soullessness of his response to tragedy.</p> <p>But we shouldn’t become immune: Trump’s response to the Orlando attack is a frightening window into how he might govern if elected. And his speech on Monday afternoon was the most terrifying of the campaign.</p> <p>The fact that it was more of the same—demagoguery, fearmongering, outright lies—shouldn’t blind us to its disgusting content. Seemingly of the belief that simply saying “radical Islam” will win the war on terror (in this, at least, he doesn’t depart from the party he now leads), Trump mouthed the phrase many times Monday afternoon. But he also mouthed many other phrases, each one more disturbing than the next. He accused the president of consciously keeping law enforcement from doing its job; he scolded Hillary Clinton for saying Muslims were peaceful; he claimed he was right to call for a Muslim ban; he talked of huddling with the NRA to help prevent attacks. He talked of “these people”; he implied that almost all Afghans were extremists; he lied about the place of birth of the alleged shooter, who was American-born. “Can you imagine what they will do in large groups?” Trump asked, saying Obama had tried to bring “large groups” of Muslims from abroad. He claimed that immigrants would constitute a Trojan horse, implying that Muslims coming here were part of some secret plan.</p> <p>He’s been saying this nonsense since Sunday morning. On Fox News, he <a type="internal">hinted</a> that Obama is either a sympathizer of Islamic terrorism, or some kind of sleeper cell. (Trump’s adviser, Roger Stone, wondered whether Clinton aide Huma Abedin was a "terrorist plant.") He’s been smearing refugees as dangerous terrorists, because in his mind, our country is overwhelmed with Syrians (we haven’t been taking very many in), our children are at risk of indoctrination by Muslims, and anyone who calls for any sort of understanding is a politically correct fool. Decency is weakness; authoritarianism is safety.</p> <p>The lowest moment of the lowest speech in this very low campaign came near the end, when Trump, noting that Muslims must talk to authorities about their neighbors, said, “The Muslim community, so importantly, they have to work with us. They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad. And they know it. And they have to do it forthwith.” It was all there: the “us” that doesn’t include Muslim-Americans, the not-so-vague menace behind the warning, the claim about what “they” know.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10157163861635725:0" type="external">the prepared version of the speech</a>, Trump specifically mentioned prison time for people who refused to cooperate. But in the actual speech, he said this instead: "These people have to have consequences. Big consequences." This last-minute edit is the essence of Trumpism. Demagogues often leave things to the imaginations of both followers and victims. Therein lies both part of their appeal and their power to frighten. It’s been clear for a long time that Donald Trump must not become president. But Monday’s speech was another reminder that the prospect of his victory should scare us, motivate us, and keep in our minds that stopping him is both a practical and moral necessity.</p></article>
	<article id="0000696" published-at="2016-07-29" title="Is America As Good As Hillary Clinton Says It Is?"><p>PHILADELPHIA—On June 15, Politico ran a <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/hillary-clinton-messaging-225581" type="external">story</a> about Hillary Clinton’s bureaucratic speechwriting process. It describes how she gets input from a handful of staffers, various consultants, and her husband. She tweaks it herself, usually to make it more prosaic. “Clinton is known for taking a draft of a speech and changing it some indelible way to make it more literal and less readable,” the piece said. Created in this fashion, the speeches are comprehensive but lack poetry, a sustained argument, or a narrative arc.</p> <p>Anyone who expected her to transcend this clunky method was probably disappointed on Thursday night. Her speech was workmanlike, more a series of bullet points than a story. She seemed loosest when she was making fun of Donald Trump: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons.”</p> <p>On Twitter, people complained about her voice. Wrote Steve Clemons, an editor at the Atlantic:</p> <q> <p>Instead of lecturing 2 citizens <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton" type="external">@HillaryClinton</a> needs 2 have conversation w/us. Modulate voice. Tell stories. Set hopes. Smile <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DNCinPHL?src=hash" type="external">#DNCinPHL</a></p>— Steve Clemons (@SCClemons) <a href="https://twitter.com/SCClemons/status/758855329488642049" type="external">July 29, 2016</a> </q> <p>Tweeted Bloomberg View's Megan McArdle:</p> <q> <p>It may be sexist that Clinton’s voice sounds hectoring when it gets loud. It’s also a fact. &amp;amp; that fact will matter <a href="https://t.co/dwanmRqFVM" type="external">https://t.co/dwanmRqFVM</a></p>— (((Megan McArdle))) (@asymmetricinfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo/status/758860161037369344" type="external">July 29, 2016</a> </q> <p>Both were quickly attacked, but my guess is that a lot of people felt the same way. If you’re a feminist, it’s deeply moving to see a woman in a white suit—one of the <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2013/03/guest-post-great-strides-for-the-new-woman-suffrage-and-fashion.html" type="external">iconic colors</a> of the suffragettes—hug her daughter and then accept her party’s nomination for president of the United States. Nevertheless, Clinton is never going to be a great orator. She’s certainly not an entertainer. She clearly prefers listening to others to talking about herself. As she said, “The truth is through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier than the public part.”</p> <p>The question now is whether this matters. Clinton presides over the party of sanity and decency and whose convention showcased the best of America. It honored mothers who’ve lost sons to police violence, even as it left Republicans <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/conservatives-agree-dnc-was-disaster-for-gop" type="external">envying</a> its optimism and patriotism. Its candidate is running against a cruel and unstable madman. If America is as great as convention speakers claimed, her citizens will not decide to blow it up because they don’t think Clinton is likable enough. This was precisely the challenge Clinton and the Democrats laid out this week for the country: Are you as great as we say you are?</p></article>
	<article id="0000697" published-at="2016-09-26" title="Clinton on Trump’s Birtherism: “A Racist Lie”"><p>Debate moderator Lester Holt, bless his heart, decided to ask Donald Trump about birtherism, i.e., Trump's chief contribution to American political discourse from the day he was born through early 2015. It did not go especially well.</p> <p>Trump responded to the question with the laughable explanation his campaign decided to go with in the end: that it was Hillary Clinton who started the rumor, that they both spent years ardently searching for President Obama's birth certificate, and only he could successfully pressure its release. This is a lie because a) Hillary Clinton did not start birtherism, and b) there was no mainstream interest in getting Obama to produce the long-form birth certificate, because it was a ridiculous fringe theory.</p> <p>Clinton responded to this "racist lie":</p> <q>
 He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted. He persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But remember, Donald started his career back in 1973, being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination. Because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. And you know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him, but I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: "When they go low, we go high." And Barack Obama went high. Despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down. </q> <p>Clinton did not, for whatever reason, directly address the spin that it was she and her top-level 2008 staffers who were the genesis of this idea.</p></article>
	<article id="0000698" published-at="2016-10-06" title="The Bizarre Political Logic That Leads Conservative Pundits to Downplay a Hurricane"><p>Bill Pugliano/Getty Images</p> Rush Limbaugh is among the prominent conservatives who have decided hurricane models are a liberal conspiracy. <p>One of the stranger and more troubling political developments of the past 15 years has been the conservative response to scientists' warnings of potentially catastrophic climate change. If climate change is real, to address it would probably require government intervention in industry. And conservatives are opposed to that. Therefore, climate change must not be real! The scientists are all lying.</p> <p>And if the scientists are the sort of people who would lie to us about the climate, what else might they be lying about? Hurricanes, for one thing.</p> <p>So goes the logic, if I may use the term loosely, of the influential conservative blogger Matt Drudge. On Thursday, as Hurricane Matthew approached the Florida coast with 130mph winds—so the scientists claim, at any rate!—Drudge spied an opportunity to plant his flag and catch out those nefarious forecasters and their politically motivated hurricane models. Here is what he decided would be <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/784121449606852608" type="external">a good idea to tweet</a>:</p> <p>Lest anyone get the mistaken impression that this was pure, shameless, and dangerously uninformed speculation on Drudge's part, he followed this up by lodging some <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/784130444614705152" type="external">more specific allegations</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/784139040236851200" type="external">meteorological misconduct</a>. The National Weather Service, it turns out, is a secretive cabal whose members hoard the real weather data so that they can cook up fake forecasts to hoodwink the public into evacuating their homes for no reason.</p> <p>Why would they do all that? What climate agenda would be served by government scientists triggering a mass evacuation for a storm that turns out to be illusory? Drudge does not deign to clarify. We're left to imagine a liberal conspiracy so farsighted that it encompasses entire fields of science and multiple arms of government, yet so nearsighted that it doesn't realize it would lose rather than gain credibility by making false predictions that will be proven wrong the moment the storm passes harmlessly by.</p> <p>Lest you think these are the delusional ramblings of a lone wingnut, my colleague Ben Mathis-Lilley points out that <a type="internal">Rush Limbaugh has espoused almost exactly the same theory</a>. From Wonkette’s post on the relevant segment of today’s Rush Limbaugh Show:</p> <q>
 The National Hurricane Center is part of the National Weather Service, which is part of the Commerce Department, which is part of the Obama administration, which by definition has been tainted just like the DOJ has. ... With hurricane tracking and hurricane forecasting, I’ve been able to spot where I think they might be playing games because it’s in the interests of the left to have destructive hurricanes because then they can blame it on climate change, which they can continue desperately continue trying to sell. </q> <p>Interestingly, Limbaugh winds up by acknowledging that Hurricane Matthew is a “serious bad storm,” perhaps to insulate himself from the angry recriminations if the damage is severe. Drudge seems to have missed that memo.</p> <p>Is it possible that it's actually Drudge and Limbaugh, and not the National Weather Service, who are misleading the public about natural disasters in order to score some cheap political points? Ah, but to believe that would require trusting professional scientists over conservative pundits to tell us the truth about science. And that in turn would suggest that perhaps we should do the same when it comes to climate science—which would then raise the specter once again of having to actually do something about it, perhaps via government intervention in industry.</p> <p>Best not to go down that road.</p></article>
	<article id="0000699" published-at="2016-10-11" title="When Powerful Men Play the Victim"><p>LONDON — During the <a type="internal">second presidential debate</a>, <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> once again complained that he was a victim. At one point he even moaned that it was three against one, implying that the two moderators and Hillary Clinton had ganged up on him and weren’t letting him speak.</p> <p>In reality, <a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/785312689241358336/photo/1" type="external">at 40:10 against 39:05</a>, Trump spoke for a minute longer than Clinton overall. But that is unlikely to satisfy his complaint, nor change the perception among his supporters that he is the “underdog,” while Clinton and her campaign team are the “bullies.”</p> <p>And despite being among the richest men in America, born to wealth in the most powerful country in the world, Trump’s message of victimhood is resonating.</p> <p>You may be forgiven for pondering aloud here… WTF? And… does he believe this stuff himself?</p> <p>I think he does.</p> <p>Power is one of life’s most addictive drugs, and we need to consider the withdrawal symptoms of this intoxicant among Trump supporters.</p> <p>When the powerful are being leveled, they become scared. Petrified of losing the deference they believe they are entitled to, they cast themselves anew as the oppressed. Used to receiving preferential treatment, they suddenly feel discriminated against.</p> <p>And so it has come to pass that every time a powerful group is equalized during times of great social upheaval, they cast themselves as <a type="internal">victims</a>.</p> <p>They feel threatened, then discriminated against, and they may grow dangerous. The years after the Great War witnessed Germans and Italians bemoaning their loss of status, which led to World War II. Many in the American South felt victimized and probably scared, when Lincoln ended slavery. Some responded with the Ku Klux Klan, then Jim Crow.</p> <p>Misogynist men felt threatened and vulnerable when women demanded universal suffrage. And Islamism emerged after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, as Arabs and Muslims were hit by a post-colonial identity crisis, no longer being able to chart the course of the world as they knew it.</p> <p>How is it that Trump, one of the most powerful men in America, can see himself as the victim? Easily. Here is a man so used to acting with impunity that even after the Central Park Five were <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/10/07/politics/trump-larry-king-central-park-five/index.html?client=safari" type="external">proven to be innocent</a> he wrote a column attacking them, and refused to apologize for calling for their death.</p> <p>Here is somebody so used to not being held to account that he felt free to boast about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/09/anderson-cooper-told-trump-that-is-sexual-assault-the-justice-department-agrees" type="external">sexual assaults</a> with people he had just met.</p> <p>Here is a relic of power so accustomed to getting what he wants that he doesn’t even let facts stand in his way (Note: Facts are only for Mexicans). And therefore, when he’s finally expected to account for his actions, to justify his assertions and defend his positions, he complains about being victimized.</p> <p>Trump is the archetypal cry-bully, so adjusted to everything revolving around him that only he can be the victim. Nobody else’s pain matters, unless of course it can be used to teach them how much he has been suffering, too.</p> <p>Originating in the 16th century, the word “bully” was <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/magazine/when-the-powerful-cry-bully.html" type="external">a term</a> of endearment meaning lover, or boel in Dutch, and brother, or broeder. Bully then evolved into a greeting for a jolly male friend. By the mid-17th century, an alternative meaning, “harasser of the weak,” had started to emerge. The connection between the positive origins of “bully” and its now almost universal negative implication of “preying on the weak” is not hard to see. That boisterous “male friend” probably just engaged in, well, too much “jolly” locker-room talk.</p> <p>Like the etymology of this word, bullies have gone full circle from being the strong picking on the weak to becoming the strong complaining about being bullied; in other words, held to account.</p> <p>An understandable desire to ditch our overbearing culture of political correctness is no excuse. As The Donald demonstrates all too often, it is possible to be politically incorrect but still have your facts completely wrong.</p></article>

But as has been made clear over and over again, the president is unable to tolerate any kind of criticism.

	<article id="0000701" published-at="2016-10-13" title="If Donald Trump Sued the New York Times or His Accusers, It Would Be a Suicide Mission">
Shutterstock <p><a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> has threatened to sue the New York Times once again, this time for publishing interviews with two women who say the billionaire <a type="internal">groped and kissed them without consent</a>.</p> <p>If that sounds familiar, it should — <a type="internal">Bill Cosby</a> pursued the same strategy. And look how well that turned out.</p> <p>Trump’s case would be similarly disastrous, and his lawyers surely know it. The threats of litigation are pure hot air.</p> <p>First, Trump has no case against the Times – or against the Palm Beach Post, which he has also threatened. The <a href="https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/786421991997902848" type="external">absurd letter</a> his lawyers sent the Times states that the “article is reckless, defamatory, and constitutes libel per se.” (Libel is, roughly, the written form of defamation; slander is the spoken form.)</p> <p>The legal term for that claim is “bullshit.”</p> <p>As a public figure, Trump would have to prove that the newspapers acted with “actual malice,” i.e., the deliberate intention of harming Trump’s reputation. While Trump makes this accusation all the time in the press, making it in court is a different story. Absent some kind of bizarre smoking gun – an email from a Times editor, for example, saying “we gotta get Trump” – it’s impossible that a court would believe that the newspaper is pursuing a vendetta against Trump, as opposed to reporting on a hot story about a presidential candidate.</p> <p>Even if the accusers’ stories turn out to be false, the Times wouldn’t be guilty of defamation. Like all careful news outlets, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html" type="external">Times</a>is careful to attribute the accusations to the women themselves: “Ms. Leeds said” “she recalled” “Ms. Crooks recalled.” This is standard journalistic practice, and of course the Times followed it to a T. The Times, itself, hasn’t said that the accusations are true. It has merely reported that the accusations are being made.</p> <p>The only shred of a legal claim in the Trump lawyers’ letter is that the Times did not adequately “test the veracity of these false and malicious allegations, including why these two individuals waited” to make them – 11 years and 30 years, respectively. That’s a claim so false as to be delusional. The third paragraph of the Times piece clearly explains that Jessica Leeds, one of the accusers, was provoked by Trump’s claim, in the second presidential debate, that he had never actually groped anyone.</p> <p>Nor is the Times likely to be intimidated by the prospect of a Trump lawsuit. They have their own lawyers, who surely reviewed the piece before it went out, and they know the law. Some have speculated that smaller news outlets may indeed be intimidated by such threats, but this type of exposure isn’t like the Hulk Hogan tape that sunk Gawker. Any properly-vetted, reasonably sourced accusations are safe; they are about a public figure and germane to a central issue in the presidential campaign.</p> <p>Indeed, though Trump has alleged politics is behind the Times piece, surely his lawyers’ threatening letter is, itself, political theater. And now the Times responded in kind, making the politically incendiary claim that since Trump has already bragged about abusing women, his reputation can't be harmed by the story. This is not a good legal defense, which the Times lawyers know; it is basically saying "we dare you to sue us."</p> <p>Trump could have a stronger case against the women themselves – but, like Cosby before him, Trump would get a lot more than he bargained for.</p> <p>To prove defamation, the statement in question must be false, harmful, and public. These statements obviously fulfill the second and third requirements – but what about the first?</p> <p>Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that ultimately, the question of truth will come down to he said/she said. Doubtless, Trump’s lawyers will do their best to paint these accusers – and the many others who have already come forward – as opportunists, or sluts, or liars, or worse. They will argue that these incidents never happened, and that the women defamed Mr. Trump by saying that they did.</p> <p>That will be a nasty process, to be sure, but the women won’t be on their own. Well-known attorney Gloria Allred, who has represented dozens of women in sexual harassment cases over the years, has already been in contact with several of the women involved. And while she did not comment on individual cases, Allred told The Daily Beast:</p> <p>“Mr. Trump's threat to sue the New York Times is outrageous. What about freedom of the press? Did Mr. Trump forget about the First Amendment or does he only talk about the amendments that he likes? He is trying to shut down a free press in this country and every citizen should speak out and protest that.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, if Trump sues, every single thing Trump has ever said about women, from the Access Hollywood video to the Howard Stern tapes, would be admissible as evidence. Just what we’ve seen so far is quite damning. If it’s a case of he said/she said – well, he boasted to Billy Bush that he kisses women non-consensually and “grabs them by the pussy” all the time.</p> <p>Worse still for Trump, the accusers would, as part of the discovery process, likely be able to obtain tapes that we haven’t even seen yet – first and foremost, those rumored tapes from the Apprentice series that include Trump using racial slurs. All of these would enter the public record.</p> <p>Oh, and there’s more. As with the Cosby case, every single woman that Trump has kissed since his clubbing days at Studio 54 would now be a potential character witness. These women may be barred from filing their own claims of sexual assault, either by statutes of limitations or by high evidentiary standards, but they’ll be quite free to testify to any encounters they’ve had with Trump.</p> <p>In sum, while Trump could harass these women and cost them some money, everything he’s ever said about or done to women will come to light. And as we <a type="internal">pointed out in the Cosby context</a>, this sort of hubris has cost other men their freedom, including Oscar Wilde, who sued his (male) lover’s father for libel even though Wilde knew that the events in question had taken place.</p> <p>Even if Trump has a different memory of his contested events, it would be very, very stupid for him to follow a similar path. Either his lawyer is bluffing, or Trump is out of his mind.</p></article>

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast <p>If you’re not paying attention, it looks like a smoking gun— <a href="https://twitter.com/mongo_ebooks/status/786182161711849472" type="external">a leaked expense report</a> tying Hillary Clinton to the media’s most powerful groups.</p> <p>The numbers from the supposedly leaked document—printed out and marked up with a highlighter, for good measure—are damning: $75,000 directly from the Clinton Foundation to polling firm Public Policy Polling. Over $333,000 sent, somehow, to the Black Panthers. Then the kicker: $30,000 to the “Sharia Law Center.”</p> <p>Of course, the whole thing is totally fake. The header for the page, “Voter Suppression,” probably should’ve given it right away. But for Trump supporters on Twitter and Facebook, a <a href="https://twitter.com/jjauthor/status/786580027487850496" type="external">Fox News contributor</a>, and <a href="http://halturnershow.com/index.php/news/world-news/356-glenn-beck-and-william-kristol-accepted-thousands-from-clinton-foundation" type="external">even radio hosts like Hal Turner</a>, it is still very much real to them.</p> <p>Chris from Massachusetts (who declined to give his last name) got ’em again. He’s spent all week trying to assuage anyone responding to his tweet with doubts about the paper’s veracity that it is the truest WikiLeak of all.</p> <p>Since the release of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails by WikiLeaks and Donald Trump’s <a type="internal">lewd Access Hollywood conversation</a>, Chris is one of many useful trolls creating intentional, immediately obvious disinformation—that will still dupe a too-large subset of devotees.</p> <p>Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, who is now polling above 20 percent in Utah, had to put out a statement Saturday denying that he took $12,000 from the Clinton Foundation. “I have no relationship to the Clinton Foundation. I oppose both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Evan_McMullin/status/787339739548426240" type="external">he said</a>.</p> <p>McMullin’s campaign even had to put up a section on his official website to denounce the printout, on which McMullin called “ <a href="https://www.evanmcmullin.com/the_dumbest_meme_on_the_internet" type="external">The Dumbest Meme on the Internet</a>.” Glenn Beck, who earned a cool hundred-grand in this fictional land, even had to block out time in his podcast this weekend to mock it. Still, the web raged on.</p> <p>“Sharia Law? Glenn Beck? Bill Ayers? Black Lives Matter? ACORN? Public Polling?” <a href="https://twitter.com/gracels/status/786317061735665664" type="external">asked Trump supporter @DebbGV</a> on Twitter. “What exactly is this money being paid out for???”</p> <p>Chris, who goes by MassRafTer on Twitter, has been duping Trump supporters with intentionally impossible-to-believe fake leaked documents for a few months now.</p> <p>“The wonderful thing is this is the third time 55 dipshits per minute have fallen for my Photoshop and MSPaint work,” Chris told The Daily Beast.</p> <p>His most high-profile escapade was a <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/donald-trump-jr-public-policy-polling-wikileaks-clinton-bribe/" type="external">fake internal memo by Public Policy Polling</a> that showed the Clinton campaign reprimanding the survey company over how poor it is at collusion.</p> <p>“Your latest poll is unacceptable. We aren’t paying you $760,000 per month to show a FIVE POINT LEAD. Are you trying to make Trump win?” it reads. “We will be ending our contract with your company unless results improve quickly.”</p> <p>The stunt landed the fake memo on far-right message boards and merited a mocking two-minute segment on MSNBC’s All In With Chris Hayes. Even Donald Trump Jr. retweeted it—before later deleting it.</p> <p>Turns out Chris was a pioneer.</p> <p>“The first one was made to be as fake looking as possible just to see if people would buy it. Now 90 percent unbelievable would be a good number,” Chris said. “So I made the new one a greatest hits of Obama and Clinton conspiracies with stuff like Larry Sinclair to make it extra obvious.”</p> <p>Sinclair is, according to a fabricated right-wing conspiracy theory, Barack Obama’s gay lover and drug peddler from the ’90s. Still, thousands of people—and counting—bought Chris’s fake posts.</p> <p>Take self-professed Trump supporter @OMFG_America, who went by @Anthony_VVeiner until Wednesday afternoon, and whose bio says his “hobbies include <a type="internal">shitposting</a>, tweeting fake news, and romantic walks on the beach.”</p> <p>Weeks ago, he posted what he alleged was Hillary Clinton’s vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine yelling at his 11-year-old daughter in a leaked voicemail. By Wednesday, when the post picked up steam, the “leak” had over 2,000 retweets.</p> <p>The audio, however, <a href="http://www.justjared.com/2007/04/20/alec-baldwin-phone-tirade-with-daughter/" type="external">was Alec Baldwin’s infamous freakout</a> from 2007, which made national news in April of that same year. Even Paul Joseph Watson of pro-Trump conspiracy website Infowars, where articles regularly appear declaring the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks an inside job, <a href="https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/786574669344182272" type="external">took to Twitter to refute it</a>.</p> <p>“Stop circulating that ‘Tim Kaine’ voicemail. It’s not him, it’s Alec Baldwin,” he wrote. “Why are some resorting to hoaxes when we have real WikiLeaks?”</p> <p>@OMFG_America later deleted the tweet, plus all of his tweets insisting it was real, and retweeted Watson. The user didn’t respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast.</p> <p>Chris, in the meantime, thinks he’s doing a minor public service—to get people be a little more discerning with random “leaks” and pieces of paper floating around the Internet.</p> <p>“Conspiracy-theory nonsense drives me crazy, as do the random Facebook political hoaxes you see every day,” he said. “I’d like to think people who aren’t in a true-believer camp feel embarrassed when they fall for something obviously fake, and then think twice the next time.”</p> <p>If Trump sought to blur reality in an effort to give legitimacy to illegitimate conspiracy theories, Chris is doing the opposite. He’s trying to hold a mirror up to those who immediately accept any information that conforms to precisely what they want to believe—no matter how unbelievable it may be.</p> <p>“Maybe, just maybe the true believers who retweet this stuff gleefully look a little less credible every time,” he said.</p> <p>His own bullshit has even served to reinforce more bullshit in the far-right message boards that thrive on leaks and anonymous posts with no attribution. “Trump supporters use these for their own, or cite my previous hoaxes to prove new ones are real,” he added.</p> <p>In the meantime, all Chris asks is for you to do the absolute bare minimum: Make one extra click before you retweet.</p> <p>“I don’t know what’s funnier, the people who believe it’s real, or the people who don’t take 10 seconds to see if I think it’s real, and debunk it to me,” he said.</p> <p>Otherwise, disinformation can get out of hand, fast—just the way some people want it.</p></article>
	<article id="0000703" published-at="2016-10-30" title="A President Clinton would be out of control: Glenn Reynolds">
He's no paragon of virtue, but it won’t be that way with a President Trump. <p>“Someone somewhere <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303402-anger-disbelief-in-clinton-camp" type="external">should have told her</a> no.” Those are the words of a Clinton ally quoted in a roundup of Democratic reactions to Hillary Clinton’s FBI news by congressional newspaper The Hill. And, despite the fact that they come from a Clinton supporter, albeit an angry and disappointed one, they may illustrate the best reason for choosing Donald Trump instead of Clinton.</p> <p>Here’s the full quote:</p> <q> <p>“I'm livid, actually. ... This has turned into malpractice. It's an unforced error at this point. I have no idea what (FBI Director) James Comey is up to but the idea this email issue is popping back up again is outrageous. It never should have occurred in the first place. Someone somewhere should have told her no. And they didn't and now we're all paying the price.”</p> </q> <p>Someone, somewhere, should have told her no. Well, yes. But who? That was the problem with Secretary of State Clinton, and it will be a bigger problem with a President Clinton. Because, by all appearances, nobody tells Clinton no, and Clinton has no compunction about breaking the rules when it suits her purposes.</p> <p>Thus the Clinton Foundation became a global money-laundering and influence-peddling organization without precedent in American history. Donors to the foundation were encouraged to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/10/27/499601267/bill-clinton-inc-wikileaks-shows-links-between-foundation-personal-cash?utm_campaign=storyshare&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social" type="external">steer money</a> to what one employee called “Bill Clinton, Inc.,” and later to Bill Clinton. State Department personnel <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fobs-hillarys-state-dept-gave-special-attention-friends/story?id=42615379" type="external">did favors</a> for people who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-morocco-emails_us_580cd86be4b0a03911ed5e27?" type="external">donated money</a> to the foundation. And to make sure that nobody found out what was going on, Clinton ran her own home-brew email server operation designed to ensure that Freedom of Information Act requests <a type="internal">turned up nothing</a> — and even President Obama, rather than saying no, went along, sending her emails at her non-government address <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-used-a-pseudonym-while-emailing-hillary-clinton-while-she-was-at-the-us-state-department-2016-9" type="external">under a fake name</a>.</p> <p>Someone somewhere should have told her no. But if the president didn't tell her no, who would? Staff at the State Department? They might have been willing to tell some other secretary of State no, but Clinton? Too risky, it seems. They certainly went along without visible objection, and without even leaks.</p> <p>The press? When The New York Times reported Clinton’s secret server, Politico’s Glenn Thrush, far from condemning it, called it “ <a href="https://twitter.com/GlennThrush/status/573094221055455232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">badass</a>.”</p> <p>Congress? Clinton has stonewalled and run rings around numerous committees investigating her. Besides, Congress had already told her no, in the form of statutes governing the treatment of government communications and classified information. She just ignored those rules and did what she wanted. Hotel magnate Leona Helmsley famously said “only little people pay taxes.” Clinton seems to feel the same way about obeying laws.</p> <p>POLICING THE USA: A look at <a href="http://preview.usatoday.com/policing/" type="external">race, justice, media</a></p> <p>It won’t be that way with a President Trump. This isn’t because Trump is any less arrogant than Clinton (though it would be hard to be more arrogant). It’s because more people will be willing to tell Trump no. The civil service, which leans overwhelmingly Democratic, won’t be bending over backwards to do his will. The press can’t stand him. And Congress, even if controlled by the GOP, won’t support him if he misbehaves because so many Republicans dislike him, too.</p> <p>The truth is, neither one of our leading candidates for president is a paragon of virtue. But only one of them has already made a habit of flouting the law while in office, selling favors and escaping the consequences, and only one of them is likely to be able to pull it off from the White House.</p> <p>And that’s the problem. If Secretary of State Clinton, serving under a president and with an eye on winning a second term in the White House, wasn’t constrained by the rules, who will constrain her if she’s president?</p> <p>The answer, most likely, is nobody.

The Republic</p> (Photo: Dorothy Edwards/Naples Daily News) <p>Since The Arizona Republic began publication in 1890, we have <a type="internal">never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican</a> for president. Never. This reflects a deep philosophical appreciation for conservative ideals and Republican principles.</p> <p>This year is different.</p> <p>The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified.</p> <p>That’s why, for the first time in our history, The Arizona Republic will support a Democrat for president.</p> What Clinton has (and Trump doesn’t) <p>The challenges the United States faces domestically and internationally demand a steady hand, a cool head and the ability to think carefully before acting.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton understands this. Donald Trump does not.</p> <p>Clinton has the temperament and experience to be president. Donald Trump does not.</p> <p>Clinton knows how to compromise and to lead with intelligence, decorum and perspective. She has a record of public service as First Lady, senator and secretary of state.</p> <p>She has withstood decades of scrutiny so intense it would wither most politicians. The vehemence of some of the anti-Clinton attacks strains credulity.</p> <p>Trump hasn’t even let the American people <a type="internal">scrutinize his tax returns</a>, which could help the nation judge his claims of business acumen.</p> Her flaws pale in comparison <p>Make no mistake: Hillary Clinton has flaws. She has made serious missteps.</p> <p>Clinton’s <a type="internal">use of a private email server</a> while secretary of State was a mistake, as she has acknowledged. Donations to the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of State raise concerns that <a type="internal">donors were hoping to buy access</a>. Though there is no evidence of wrongdoing, she should have put up a firewall.</p> <p>Yet despite her flaws, Clinton is the superior choice.</p> <p>She does not casually say things that embolden our adversaries and frighten our allies. Her approach to governance is mature, confident and rational.</p> <p>MORE: <a type="internal">Why does The Republic endorse, anyway?</a></p> <p>That cannot be said of her opponent.</p> <p>Clinton retains her composure under pressure. She’s tough. She doesn’t back down.</p> <p>Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads.</p> <p>That’s beneath our national dignity.</p> <p>When the president of the United States speaks, the world expects substance. Not a blistering tweet.</p> Whose hand do you want on the nuclear button? Hillary Clinton knows the issues, history and facts. <p>Clinton has argued America’s case before friendly and unfriendly foreign leaders with tenacity, diplomacy and skill. She earned respect by knowing the issues, the history and the facts.</p> <p>She is intimately familiar with the challenges we face in our relations with Russia, China, the Middle East, North Korea and elsewhere. She’ll stand by our friends and she’s not afraid to confront our enemies.</p> <p>Contrast Clinton’s tenacity and professionalism with Trump, who began his campaign with gross generalities about Mexico and <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/video/donald-trump-mexico-is-bringing-drugs-crime-and-rapists-to-the-us/4322361468001" type="external">Mexicans as criminals and rapists</a>. These were <a type="internal">careless slaps at a valued trading partner</a> and Arizona’s neighbor. They were thoughtless insults about people whose labor and energy enrich our country.</p> <p>Trump demonstrated his clumsiness on the world stage by making nice with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto only a few hours before <a type="internal">appearing in Phoenix to deliver yet another rant</a> about Mexican immigrants and border walls.</p> Arizona’s been there on immigration (it doesn’t work) <p>What’s more, Arizona went down the hardline immigration road Trump travels. It led our state to SB 1070, <a type="internal">the 2010 “show me your papers” law</a> that earned Arizona international condemnation and did nothing to resolve real problems with undocumented immigration.</p> <p>Arizona understands that we don’t need a repeat of that divisive, unproductive fiasco on the national level. A recent poll shows Arizonans <a type="internal">oppose both more walls and the mass deportations</a> Trump endorses.</p> <p>We need a president who can broker solutions.</p> <p>Clinton <a type="internal">calls for comprehensive immigration reform</a>, a goal that business, faith and law enforcement leaders have sought for years. Her support for a pathway to citizenship and her call for compassion for families torn apart by deportation are consistent with her longtime support for human rights.</p> Clinton’s equality vs. Trump’s lack of respect Hillary Clinton has made a career fighting for gender equality. <p>As secretary of state, Clinton made gender equality a priority for U.S. foreign policy. This is an extension of Clinton’s bold “women’s rights are human rights” speech in 1995.</p> <p>It reflects an understanding that America’s commitment to human rights is a critically needed beacon in today’s troubled world.</p> <p>Trump’s long history of objectifying women and his demeaning comments about women during the campaign are not just good-old-boy gaffes.</p> <p>They are evidence of deep character flaws. They are part of a pattern.</p> <p>Trump <a type="internal">mocked a reporter’s physical handicap</a>. Picked a <a type="internal">fight with a Gold Star family</a>. <a type="internal">Insulted POWs</a>. Suggested a <a type="internal">Latino judge can’t be fair</a> because of his heritage. Proposed <a type="internal">banning Muslim immigration</a>.</p> <p>Each of those comments show a stunning lack of human decency, empathy and respect. Taken together they reveal a candidate who doesn’t grasp our national ideals.</p> A centrist or a wild card? <p>Many Republicans understand this. But they shudder at the thought of Hillary Clinton naming Supreme Court justices. So they stick with Trump. We get that. But we ask them to see Trump for what he is — and what he is not.</p> <p>Trump’s conversion to conservatism is recent and unconvincing. There is no guarantee he will name solid conservatives to the Supreme Court.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton has long been a centrist. Despite her tack left to woo Bernie Sanders supporters, Clinton retains her centrist roots. Her justices might not be in the mold of Antonin Scalia, but they will be accomplished individuals with the experience, education and intelligence to handle the job.</p> <p>They will be competent. Just as she is competent.</p> If a candidate can’t control his words <p>Trump’s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security. His recent efforts to stay on script are not reassuring. They are phony.</p> <p>The president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can’t command his own rhetoric.</p> <p>Were he to become president, his casual remarks — such as saying he <a type="internal">wouldn’t defend NATO partners</a> from invasion — could have devastating consequences.</p> <p>Trump has <a type="internal">praised Russian President Vladimir Putin</a>, a thug who has made it clear he wants to expand Russia’s international footprint.</p> <p>Trump suggested Russia <a type="internal">engage in espionage against Hillary Clinton</a> — an outrageous statement that he later insisted was meant in jest.</p> <p>Trump said President Obama and Hillary Clinton <a type="internal">were “co-founders” of ISIS</a>, then walked that back by saying it was sarcasm.</p> <p>It was reckless.</p> <p>Being the leader of the free world requires a sense of propriety that Trump lacks.</p> Clinton’s opportunity to heal this nation This is Hillary Clinton’s moment to reach those who feel left behind. <p>We understand that Trump’s candidacy tapped a deep discontent among those who feel left behind by a changed economy and shifting demographics.</p> <p>Their concerns deserve to be discussed with respect.</p> <p>Ironically, Trump hasn’t done that. He has merely pandered. Instead of offering solutions, he hangs scapegoats like piñatas and invites people to take a swing.</p> <p>In a nation with an increasingly diverse population, Trump offers a recipe for permanent civil discord.</p> <p>In a global economy, he offers protectionism and a false promise to bring back jobs that no longer exist.</p> <p>America needs to look ahead and build a new era of prosperity for the working class.</p> <p>This is Hillary Clinton’s opportunity. She can reach out to those who feel left behind.

	<article id="0000706" published-at="2016-10-10" title="These Shameless Donald Trump Surrogates Should Be Applauded For Their Loyalty"><p>Following the leaked Access Hollywood audio from the early 2000s and his second terrible debate performance in a row, Donald Trump’s prospects for becoming President grow more bleak with each passing day. Let’s remember, however, that it was so long ago that he steamrolled his GOP competition and looked like he might be a formidable competitor. Trump couldn’t have risen to the front of the Republican pack without a little help from his surrogates. There are dozens of talking heads bouncing from show to show and channel to channel banging the drum for the Donald. While every campaign has their partisans, Trump’s supporters in the media have been some of the most dishonest blowhards ever to rise up in a field known for dishonest blowhards. As the sun sets on Trump’s campaign, let’s look back at the people who brought him this far. Here are the Most Shameless Trump surrogates.</p> <p>The Arkansas attorney general was trotted out by the Trump campaign once they decided Bill Clinton’s infidelity could be a useful campaign smear. She dutifully made the rounds in the media claiming that Americans don’t care about Trump’s tax returns and that they want to talk about Clinton’s sexual history. CBS’s <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/bob-schieffer-grills-trump-surrogate-can-you-admit-you-have-no-evidence/" type="external">Bob Schieffer completely grilled her</a> anecdotal evidence and legalistic posturing on a recent CBS appearance. He pressed her to admit she has no evidence for her claims, and there’s nothing she could say to contradict him.</p> <p>Even by Fox News standards, Hannity has been an unabashed Trump supporter from the very beginning. He has even picked fights with co-workers like Megyn Kelly over their refusal to carry water for Trump. In this clip from a few days ago, he was quick to draw parallels between Bill Clinton and Donald Trump and downplay his words as “locker room talk.”</p> <p>Even before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, Ann Coulter was by his side. Several journalists have reported that conversations with Coulter and her book Adios, America directly shaped Trump’s immigration policies. When Coulter talks about Trump, as in the clip above, she talks like he is the living embodiment of her hard line right wing ideas. No matter what Trump says or does, she stands by Trump’s side, as long as he builds that wall.</p> <p>Few Trump surrogates are as artless as Pierson. She often speaks with the nuance of the necklace of bullets she likes to wear around her neck. She’s been caught in lies on-air on several occasions, and rarely does a news cycle go by that she doesn’t get herself in hot water. Back in December, she responded to concerns about Trump’s Muslim ban by saying, “So what, they’re Muslims.”</p> <p>Often seen on CNN, McEnany was a lowly cog in the Fox News machine until she saw her opportunity to seize the limelight during this Trump-ified election cycle. Her resume is so lean that CNN often simply bills her as “Trump Supporter” when they invite her on their air. It doesn’t take long to find video clips where she fails miserably at her Trump supporting high-wire act. Here’s one instance of just such a stumble from an attempted reference to Martin Luther King Jr. on a panel last August.</p> <p>Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski landed at CNN following his ouster from the campaign after he was accused of assaulting a reporter. Obviously an ethical quagmire, Lewandowski’s hiring became even more suspect when it was revealed that he was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trumps-surrogate-circus/2016/08/30/eba13250-6edf-11e6-8365-b19e428a975e_story.html?utm_term=.00455af9d56f" type="external">taking checks from Trump</a> as “severence” while posing as a media figure. His integrity is evident in the above recent CNN clip where he defends Trump’s recent comments saying “we’re not electing a Sunday school teacher.”</p> <p>After tweeting an offensive cartoon depicting Hillary Clinton last summer, Burns, an African-American pastor who spoke at the GOP convention, was quietly shuffled off of the Trump surrogate circuit. Trump couldn’t successfully distance himself from Burns fast enough; the pastor brought the campaign trouble again when it was revealed that he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GmDqeZr97w" type="external">wasn’t who he claimed to be</a>. Burns falsified aspects of his biography including claims of an Army reserve record and college graduation, raising further questions about the firebrand preacher.</p> <p>New Hampshire representative and Trump veterans coordinator suggested that Hillary “should be put on the firing line and shot for treason” several months ago. When given the chance to walk back the comment, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/clinton-baldasaro/496199/" type="external">he doubled down on his remarks</a>. He also called Khizr Khan, father of a slain gold star American soldier, a “Muslim Brotherhood agent” after Khan gave a moving speech at the DNC When called out for his controversial statements, Baldasaro has repeatedly blamed the left wing media for distorting his words, when in fact, they had been quoting him verbatim.</p> <p>Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has been one of Trump’s most loyal surrogates. Early this year, he invited people to take unfounded conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton’s health as truth when he said, “Go online and put down ‘Hillary Clinton illness.’ Take a look at the videos for yourself.” Giuliani’s relentless, reckless defense of Trump has continued through his recent troubles. When other Trump surrogates ducked scrutiny this past weekend, Giuliani jumped on the chance to make all five Trump media appearances slated for Sunday morning. Chuck Todd battered him on Meet the Press, but we have no reason to believe he won’t be back for more.</p> <p>Perhaps the most shameless supporter of Donald Trump has been New Jersey governor Chris Christie. After exchanging heated bluster with Trump throughout the primary season, Christie began supporting Trump with a press conference that reminded Twitter of Game of Thrones. And no, he didn’t look like John Snow.</p> <p>Tea Party mainstay Scottie Nell Hughes has been a loyal Trump defender throughout the election. She has been forced to defend riots and sexual harassment on behalf of Donald Trump, among other egregious policies and statements from the Donald. As if this wasn’t enough indignity for her to suffer on Trump’s behalf, Ana Navarro recently roasted Hughes for suggesting she was offended by Navarro using the word “p-ssy” when quoting Trump. It seems that these surrogates have no shame, but in this election cycle, Trump is truly testing the limits of even the most craven surrogates. Though, if they’ve made it this far, it seems that there might be nothing that could sway these talking heads away from Trump’s camp.</p> <p>Watch Carri Twigg and VH1 Live host Marc Lamont Hill explain why it is an absolute MUST that you cast your ballot next month.</p></article>

Before dispersing, an enraged group that had splintered off from an earlier demonstration over the acquittal of officer Jason Stockley in his trial for the murder of Anthony Lamar Smith descended upon the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson.</p> <p>It is estimated that a crowd of nearly 1,000 were followed to the Mayor's home by riot police, who would eventually deploy tear gas and make arrests after Krewson's windows were shattered and building doused with paint. The protesters responded by tossing rocks and bricks at the officers. Other properties along the Central West End neighborhood were reportedly vandalized as well.</p> <p>Nearly three dozen arrests had been made heading into the late hours of Saturday. Due to the threat of rioting, numerous businesses shot down and several events were canceled, including a U2 concert and an Ed Sheeran show that had been scheduled to take place.</p></article>

The incident took place in Charlotte County, Florida. Despite the incident taking place with the child’s mother witnessing the whole ordeal, no arrest has been made.</p> <p>The child, Malikai Villatte, told Fox 4, “He was screaming at us, cursing at us, calling us the 'n-word' and he came down to the middle of his yard, and I was like 'who are you talking to?,' and he said 'come within arm's reach and I'll show you who I'm talking to.’” Vincent Cerfalo, the man who punched the child, also spat on Villatte after punching his front teeth out according to witnesses.</p> <p>Now, Cerfalo is claiming self-defense in the whole incident. The 27-year-old man explained his side of the incident to Fox 4, saying, "I told them to back off and if they come on my property I’m going to defend myself. They said, ‘you won’t hit us, you won’t hit us,’ and they started to surround me.”</p> <p>Cerfalo went on to say, “It was not my intention to hit anybody that hard, it was not my intention to knock teeth out or do harm, or cause any kind of trouble.”</p> <p>Despite him saying he was surrounded, the children noted they never touched the man. Cerfalo went on to say that he has plans on pressing charges against the 12-year-old boy, even though he knocked the young boy’s teeth out.</p></article>

However, on Tuesday, October 17, while making his way to an NFL owners meeting, Jones faced harsh criticism for his remarks by protestors.</p> <p>In the clip circling the web, Carl Dix, an African-American man, and Linda Solotaire, a white woman, spotted Jones and his Stephen and daughter Charlotte in the Conrad New York lobby and the pair were not shy about unloading on the owner. “You want to treat them [players] like $40 million slaves. Gladiators who are well paid to beat each other’s brains out, but they have to keep their mouths shut when talking about injustice." Dix said. "Look at the videos of the police getting away with murder and tell me are wrong for protesting, and that they have no right to do that.”</p> <p>The protesters add to the list of individuals who have come out against the stance of Jones. Recently, rapper and activist Common said Jones displayed a “slave owner mentality" towards players expressing their first amendment rights.</p> <p>Check out the video above.</p></article>

	<article id="0000711" published-at="2016-06-19" title="The lie that is Hillary"><a type="internal"/> Illustration on Hillary Clinton’s corrupt background by Alexander Hunter/The Washington Times more &amp;gt; <p>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</p> <p>Many of us remember the classic line from the “Seinfeld” show, that “it’s not a lie if you believe it.” Applying that theme to the evolution of Hillary Rodham, then Hillary Rodham Clinton, and now just plain <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a>, here are the notable accomplishments of her “public service” career:</p> <p>• Flunked the D.C. Bar Exam.</p> <p>• Was removed from her House Judiciary Committee staffer job because of incompetence and lying.</p> <p>• The Whitewater scandal.</p> <p>• Married a serial liar and cheater, who occasionally had sexual encounters with nonconsenting partners.</p> <p>• Lied about “sniper fire” in an attempt to simulate exposure to danger in a war zone.</p> <p>• The subject of a “vast right-wing conspiracy” that led to the impeachment and disbarment of her husband</p> <p>• Took crockery, furniture, artwork and other items from the White House — had to return and/or pay for them.</p> <p>• Said “what difference, at this point, does it make” about four brave people killed in Libya as a direct result of her failure to protect them on the anniversary of 9/11.</p> <p>• Totally ignored the structure and rules for the handling of sensitive national security information.</p> <p>• Amassed a personal fortune with “speaking fees” and payments from private sector political donors and foreign governments into transparent “foundations” in obvious exchange for future political favor.</p> <p>Two conclusions emerge from this nefarious list of “accomplishments”:</p> <p>First, <a type="internal">Hillary</a>’s brief solo “professional” career [without Bill] was a total failure, and of her own doing. This despite high-level political sponsorship to get her a key “entry level” job as a legal staffer on the Nixon Impeachment investigation in the early 1970s. But she flunked the D.C. Bar Exam [perhaps the easiest in those days] and got fired from her staff job.</p> <p>Second, she is identified today in friendly media solely by her “career” post-marriage to Bubba. This is the part that Barack Obama recently described as making her “probably the best qualified person ever to run for president.” This is both laughable and ironic, as she is better qualified than was Mr. Obama, arguably the most unqualified person ever elected president. And, as presidential aspirants go, they had one professional “qualification” in common: Neither had ever worked in a “real job.”</p> <p>After she and Bill left the White House [along with the furniture, crockery and art work they took with them] she simply punched her ticket with two more political gigs that were handed to her. Neither of which identify her as anything but an opportunist, saying and doing whatever necessary to perpetuate her “new” political career, this while biding her time until she could run for president — twice.</p> <p>Her time as a senator from New York was purely a block-checking exercise to stay “relevant.” Best illustrating this is the question: Why didn’t they go back to Arkansas? Easy, returning to Arkansas would have been the political — and financial — end for them and they knew it. It’s the same reason the Obamas are not returning to Chicago. And in this context, look for an “Obama Foundation” that rakes in money and a series of <a type="internal">Hillary</a>-style political appointments for Michelle — after all, she flunked the Bar Exam too.</p> <p>More than anything else, <a type="internal">Hillary</a>’s campaign is counting on the “newer” American voters to simply not remember her and Bill’s checkered political and legal past. Accordingly, we can expect a Republican campaign replay of the 1990s: Bill’s Impeachment, the Star investigation, Bill’s disbarment for lying, her Rose Law Firm partner going to jail — and on and on and on — as supplemented by her latest scandals: Benghazi, “speaking” fees and classified emails.</p> <p>So, is <a type="internal">Hillary</a> “really” qualified to be president, or is it just a lie she believes after so many years with “slick Willy” and a series of political jobs?</p> <p>Sadly, her flakey “qualifications” may not matter at all — because if she wins, it will likely be a repeat of the 1992 election debacle: Remember that Bill would never have been elected had it not been for the third party “spoiler” candidacy of H. Ross Perot, who took 20 million votes away from George H.W. Bush — literally giving the election away and beginning the Clinton protracted political soap opera we are still dealing with.</p> <p>Will it happen again? Will the latest rupture in the Republican Party work to elect “crooked <a type="internal">Hillary</a>,” the other half of the Clinton sleaze team? Will horny old Bill — again — be on “intern patrol” in the White House and “feeling our pain”?</p> <p>These are the “truthful” parts of the lie that have most of us saying: “is this really the best we can do?”.</p> <p>• Daniel Gallington frequently writes about national security.</p> <p>The Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im, our third-party provider.

	<article id="0000714" published-at="2016-10-17" title="The anti-Semitism we hoped to never see again: Column">
An ugly narrative of hatred from the left and the right that's untethered to normative reality. <p>Just one day after the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Donald Trump was talking about “international banks” and “global financial powers.” His race against Hillary Clinton, he said <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/10/13/497857068/transcript-donald-trumps-speech-responding-to-assault-accusations" type="external">in West Palm Beach, Fla</a>., “will determine whether we're a free nation, or whether we have only an illusion of democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of special global interests rigging the system ... The establishment and their media neighbors wield control over this nation through means that are very well known.”</p> <p>Those who are familiar with the language of anti-Semitism have seen <a href="https://twitter.com/JGreenblattADL/status/786672319452291074" type="external">this particular trope</a> before: Hitler used it to great effect. The only difference is that Hitler was honest enough to pinpoint the “small handful” as being <a href="http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111hit1.html" type="external">composed of Jews</a>.</p> <p>It’s been decades since the motley American Jewish community has been deeply unsettled by anti-Semitism. But such is the state of things that even at my own synagogue, in an idyllic, leafy, and largely progressive New Jersey suburb, the rabbi wrapped a sermon around it.</p> <p>An adult student came to him with great anguish, asking for guidance about how Jews might respond to what he described as growing violence and increasingly freer expressions of hate. His answer: compassion and loving-kindness, as prescribed by the Torah.</p> <p>But compassion and loving-kindness have not been front and center for some time. In fact, a certain brand of Jew-hatred, one that is tinged not with right-wing paranoia but with left-wing sanctimony, has for some years now been quite the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/opinion/sunday/anti-semitism-at-my-university-hidden-in-plain-sight.html?_r=0" type="external">in-thing on American campuses</a>.</p> <p>Undergraduates at some of our most prestigious <a href="http://www.adl.org/israel-international/anti-israel-activity/c/bds-on-american-college-2014-2015.html#.WAPF7_ArJqM" type="external">universities and colleges</a> in the nation, gathering under the banner of <a href="http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/336426/transgender-activist-janet-mock-cancels-talk-at-brown-u-hillel-after-pinkwa/" type="external">progressive humanism</a>, have taken to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/21/sjp-petitioning-against-hillel-is-not-anti-semitic/" type="external">barring Hillel</a> (the largest student Jewish organization operating in the United States) from taking part in campus events that have nothing whatsoever to do with religious, ethnic, or national issues, and demonizing Israel.</p> <p>Yup: It’s back, and not only is it back but becoming fashionable. I’m not talking about Europe, where <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/opinion/an-anti-semitism-of-the-left.html?_r=0" type="external">anti-Semitism from the left</a> has long been ascendant, but America.</p> <p>The most recent movement to join this swelling chorus of hatred on the left is — tragically, I think— Black Lives Matter, which recently adopted a platform <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/black-lives-matter-platform-author-defends-israel-genocide-claim/" type="external">charging Israel with genocide</a>.</p> <p>Not ISIL ( <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/mass-grave-yazidis-killed-isil-discovered-iraq-151128155706194.html" type="external">thousands of Yazidis</a> murdered). Not North Korea (where <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/opinion/pyongyangs-hunger-games.html" type="external">untold millions</a>, including children, have been killed by famine, imprisonment in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/16/world/asia/north-korea-un-report/" type="external">slave camps, and torture</a>.) Not Syria, where Bashar Assad's forces continue to kill Syrian citizens by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/03/15/the-syrian-wars-death-toll-is-absolutely-staggering-but-no-one-can-agree-on-the-number/" type="external">hundreds of thousands</a>. Nope: it’s Israel that some misguided folks at Black Lives Matter have singled out for accusations of genocide, even though Israel applies capital punishment only for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/opinion/capital-punishment-is-not-israels-answer-to-terrorism.html" type="external">crimes against humanity</a>, and in practice Israel hasn’t sought the death penalty in decades. In other words, Israel, alone among the nations in its neighborhood, has never practiced state-sponsored bloodshed.</p> <p>But none of that matters: not the facts, not the figures, not the bloody history of Israel’s neighbors, not the bloody history of Europe, not that Israel was born out of desperation, not any of it — because that’s how it is with anti-Semitism, whether from the left or the right. Because when it comes to hating Jews, normative reality has nothing to do with it. The only thing that matters is the narrative of hatred.</p> <p>Given the current license-to-hate climate, it's no surprise that the number of anti-Semitic assaults, while hardly in league with those suffered by Jews under fascist or militaristic regimes, has suddenly <a href="http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/anti-semitism-usa/2015-audit-anti-semitic-incidents.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#.WAPEJ_ArJqM" type="external">swerved upwards</a>.

But when it comes to sheer outright Jew-hatred, I simply don’t see any difference between anti-Semitism coming from the right, as in the case of Nazi Germany or Saudi Arabian propaganda depicting Jews as bloodthirsty child-murderers, or from the left, as in the case of the <a href="http://www.adl.org/israel-international/anti-israel-activity/c/bds-on-american-college-2014-2015.html#.WAPF7_ArJqM" type="external">BDS movement</a> (Boycott, Divest, and Sanction) now raging on American campuses.</p> <p>After the Holocaust, anti-Semitism wasn’t supposed to be something to worry about. Sure, the civilized world thought: there’d always be your occasional anti-Semitic nut-job. Nut-jobs happen. But outright, pure, public and organized antisemitism? Hard to fathom. Not here, in America. Not in post-war, Europe, either.</p> <p>And yet, <a href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/chaverim" type="external">chaverim</a>, like Freddy Krueger in the Halloween movie franchise, it’s baaaaack!</p> <p>There’s a photo making its way around the internet of an elderly woman holding up a sign that says: “I cannot believe <a href="https://allhumanmatters.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/protest.jpg?w=529" type="external">I still have to protest</a> this s--t." The “s--t” in question is the rash of anti-woman laws and restrictions that have been fielded in recent years, including a push to shut off funding for Planned Parenthood. And sure, the sign is funny.

Being animal lovers, we rushed to the nearest police station in Talaghattapura and gave a complaint. We were assured that action was being taken, and police officers were deployed in the area."</p> <p>"Since I was getting no updates, I proceeded to the spot with a co-complainant and two police constables in my car itself, since no police vehicle was available. Upon reaching the spot, I saw a mob gathered there, and assumed that there would be police too, as promised. However, there was nobody, and I felt like I was trapped. The mob started hurling concrete blocks, boulders and glass bottles from all directions, screaming pro-Pakistan slogans. It was the worst experience of my life," she added.</p> <p>Nandini's car was also severely damaged by the mob."I didn't expect to come out alive of this incident. 150-200 people gathered within minutes, trying everything to harm us. There was no police to save us. Criminals can only behave like this, as only such mafias have the ability to mobilise such large crowds immediately. I'm quite sure even the police are involved, as if the officers had any intention of being honest, a lady would not be allowed to take such a risk," she added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, condemning the incident, former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa took to Twitter and said, "Condemn the brutal mob-attack on the woman who exposed illegal cow slaughter. This violent attack today in Bengaluru is another proof law &amp;amp; order breakdown under @cmofkarnataka Sh. @siddaramiah."</p></article>

	<article id="0000722" published-at="2017-10-18" title="Trump says Comey knew he was going to exonerate Clinton"><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to revive his long-standing complaint about the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, alleging that then-Director James Comey had protected the Democratic presidential nominee by prematurely “exonerating” her before the 2016 election.</p> <p>“Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this — obviously a fix?” Trump wrote. “Where is Justice Dept?”</p> <p>Trump’s latest online burst came in response to the FBI’s release of heavily blacked out draft statements from May 2016 by Comey in preparation for closing the Clinton investigation without criminal charges.</p> <p>Trump tweeted that the draft statements, whose existence was previously known, show the FBI had exonerated “Crooked Hillary Clinton” long before the investigation was complete. He tweeted: “James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!”</p> <p>In interview excerpts released in August by the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI officials said Comey and investigators had determined by the spring of 2016 that charges weren’t warranted, and had begun thinking of how the public should be informed of that decision. Clinton was interviewed by the FBI in early July, just days before Comey announced the investigation’s conclusion. That timing has prompted criticism that FBI leadership had prejudged the conclusion before completing the investigation.</p> <p>When Comey announced the end of the case last year, he said the FBI had found no evidence that anyone intended to violate laws governing classified materials, which it considered a prerequisite for bringing a case. He said the FBI had thoroughly investigated the case for a year before deciding to conclude it.</p> <p>“We went at this very hard to see if we could make a case,” Comey told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee days after announcing his recommendation that Clinton not face charges.</p> <p>Trump, as both a candidate and now president, has long complained about the FBI’s handling of the email case, though his criticism has varied.</p> <p>He initially cited Comey’s actions in the investigation as a basis for Comey’s firing in May, though Trumo later acknowledged that he was determined to replace the FBI director even without the recommendation of the Justice Department.</p> <p>The president complained again after Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released excerpts of interviews with FBI officials close to Comey. Those interviews showed that draft statements to close out the Clinton investigation had begun circulating among a tight circle of FBI officials in the spring of 2016.</p> <p>The interviews were conducted by officials from the Office of Special Counsel who were trying to determine if Comey’s actions had violated a federal law that bars government officials from using their positions to influence an election. That investigation was closed following Comey’s firing by Trump in May.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP" type="external">http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP</a></p></article>
	<article id="0000723" published-at="2017-08-21" title="Are vehicle attacks the new form of terrorism?">
The fact that vans are are easily accessible and they do not require much of a background check has been one of the main reasons for an increase in vehicle terror attacks. PHOTO: REUTERS <p>The horrific events this week in <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twin-attacks-in-spain-police-say-suspects-were-planning-bigger-attack/story-Axy920PEfCVWERoR3ND1KK.html" type="external">Spain</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-stabbing-idUSKCN1AY1IS" type="external">Finland</a> are a tragic recurrence of major terror incidents in the western nations. Once more we bear witness to the sort of nihilistic savagery that indiscriminately murders innocents with impunity.</p> <p>Let us be very clear about this. Those who <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-barcelona-attack-terror-group-responsibility-las-ramblas-islamists-islamic-state-a7899406.html" type="external">carried out these attacks</a> are not just murderers, they are immoral ingrates who have slaughtered the citizens of a nation that took them in and gave them the opportunities their own countries had failed to provide them.</p> <p>In 2017 alone, there have been <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/news/timeline-vehicle-terror-attacks-europe/" type="external">numerous terror attacks</a> involving vehicles. From the London Bridge attack, to the Drottninggatan, Stockholm attack to the Paris attack to the Barcelona attack – they keep increasing in number and we are helpless against them. Vehicles are constantly being submerged into crowds and we are motionless against them.</p> <p>The fact that vans are are easily accessible and they do not require much of a background check has been one of the main reasons for an increase in vehicle terror attacks. Furthermore, they are also cheap, cause great damage and are a convenient way to flee the scene.</p> <p>It is evident that vehicle terror attacks are slowly replacing suicide bomb attacks due the aforementioned reasons.</p> <p>Not only must these criminals be punished, the trail that leads to their handlers, their financiers and their recruiters must be followed to the very end – no matter who they are or where they are.</p> <p>It is also time the world started to rethink its counter-terrorism policy because whatever has been done so far has not only failed, it has amplified the problem.</p> <p>For too long, the focus has been on the nebulous constructs of ‘radicalisation’ and ‘ideology’. I feel that chasing the smoke trails of dogma will achieve nothing unless the actual players in this grotesque parade of death and terror are neutered.</p> <p>This wild goose chase has protected from accountability the dictators and monarchs of the Middle East whose brutality and stifling of free speech has done nothing but incubated terrorism. It takes the attention away from the government and institutions – both political and religious – from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, who champion sectarian and anti-western sentiment to suit their political needs.</p> <p>Over the years, it has allowed a glossing over of the role the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-14666720/2003-invasion-of-iraq" type="external">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> played in creating the arena of chaos and the deluge of armaments that enabled the rise of Islamic State (IS).</p> <p>It leaves unscathed the internet cabal of IS recruiters who disseminate the atrocity exhibition of their propaganda videos globally. And they seem to have no problem in <a type="internal">luring Muslim youth</a> from all over the world and graduating them from some crash course in violent extremism.</p> <p>It is self-evident that the weapons, political intrigue and invasions of powerful nations are the immediate triggers for much of this modern violent extremism. But it is equally true that it is the disunity, intolerance and sectarian sentiment among Muslim societies that provides saboteurs the flames that they easily pour gasoline on. The song remains the same: It was ‘divide and conquer’ then, it is ‘divide and conquer’ now.</p> <p>It is that vile loathing of Muslims by Muslims that allowed the US and Israel to ship arms to both Iran and Iraq during their decade long bloody war. It was the existing ethnic and sectarian fault lines in Afghanistan and Pakistan that allowed the US and Russia to fight a <a type="internal">proxy war</a> through them for 11 years. This war gave these religiously-themed militias a grand stage with a global audience and kicked off a global jihadi enterprise that had never existed before.</p> <p>It was Iraq’s asinine invasion that <a type="internal">facilitated</a> the first Gulf war. Al Qaeda claimed that the war and stationing of US troops near Hijaz was its primary reason for organising and attacking western targets. And it was the willingness of Gulf States to support – and the failure of the Muslim world at large to forcefully resist – the second <a type="internal">Iraq invasion of 2003</a> that unleashed the unprecedented brutality of the <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/1234515/live-turkish-president-addresses-parliament-record-third-time-2/" type="external">group psychopathy</a> known as Daesh.</p> <p>This never was or will be a clash between Islam and the West neither is it in any form or fashion a global pan-Islamic insurgency. What global agenda could those busy-slaughtering-their-own possibly pursue?</p> <p>In the final analysis, I believe this is a problem arising from the fractious societies and destructive leadership of Muslim majority nations. The fallout in the rest of the world is a direct outcome of the intrusion and positioning of the US, Europe and Russia into these conflicts through war and transfer of weaponry.</p> <p>A solution to global terrorism will be predicated on political reform in the Muslim world. For the citizens of these nations, unity is the only way tyranny, terrorism and imperialist ambition will be thwarted. Peace will remain a dream unless sectarian, tribal and ethnic divisions exist.</p> <p>For the West, the best possible course is to pressure their leadership to stop supporting and arming the most brutal regimes in the Muslim world and to cease their ambitions of exploitation and geopolitical game of chess. Interventionism has gained the world nothing but more bloodshed and strife.</p> <p>Just like Muslim nations must cease differentiating between good and bad terrorism, the West must stop justifying its hegemonic ambitions such as human rights or security contingencies.</p></article>

	<article id="0000729" published-at="2016-09-29" title="Mike Pence: Donald Trump is ready to lead"><p>Many voters don't have a clear image in their minds of major party vice presidential nominees Mike Pence and Tim Kaine, despite the nearness of the 2016 presidential election. Here's a look at their similarities and differences. (Dwight Adams/IndyStar) Wochit</p> (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) <p>In fewer than 40 days, the American people will choose a new president who will set the course of this nation not only for the next four years, but for a generation to come. Between the candidates, the choice could not be more clear.</p> <p>By electing Donald Trump, the American people have the opportunity to choose a bold leader. In a political world often reserved for talkers, Donald Trump is a doer. I’ve come to know the man who invited me to join him on the Republican ticket as thoughtful, compassionate and steady. Above all, I know he is ready to lead the United States as our next president and commander in chief.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton’s candidacy embodies the status quo and the failed policies of Washington, D.C. With her we will get more of the same: more taxes, more spending, more regulation and more government.</p> <p>As Donald Trump and I crisscross the country, it has become clear to me that there is a movement building. This movement reminds me of the one built by a leader whom we now regard as one of our nation’s greatest presidents.</p> <p>In 1980, Ronald Reagan was regarded by the Washington political establishment as little more than a cowboy or a celebrity who entered politics late in life. He even made some Republicans uneasy. Along the way, people heard his vision of a renewed America. Americans from all walks of life flocked to a man who was so clearly unbound by Washington niceties and political correctness.</p> <p>Ronald Reagan spoke the truth in 1980 to the American people, just as Donald Trump has in 2016.</p> <p>Donald Trump is a candidate who speaks honestly and frankly about the challenges we face. I have seen this good man come alongside those whose lives and property were ravaged by floodwaters in Louisiana. I have seen people pack arenas and fairgrounds by the thousands or stand in a driving rainstorm to hear the message of a brighter future.</p> <p>Donald Trump believes in the greatness of this country and the boundless potential of the American people.</p> <p>In recent months, Donald Trump has laid out a vision to improve America’s standing at home and abroad. He will rebuild our military, defeat radical Islamic terror and reject the bad deals that jeopardize our security and that of our allies.</p> <p>At home, Donald Trump will empower the American people to revive our economy. He’ll cut taxes for all Americans and halt onerous new federal regulations. He’ll rewrite our trade deals so they help American workers. He’ll end the war on coal and develop new American sources of energy.</p> <p>Donald Trump has committed to expanding educational choice for disadvantaged kids. He will repeal Obamacare and make health care more affordable and accessible.</p> <p>The next president will also set the course and direction of the Supreme Court for decades. To that end, Donald Trump will appoint men and women who will strictly construe the Constitution and not legislate from the bench.</p> <p>Our opponent stands in every way opposed to the change offered by Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton personifies why the American people have so little confidence in our political leaders. Over three decades in public life, we have grown accustomed to the hallmarks of the Clinton way. Wherever they go, issues of ethics and improprieties are not far behind.</p> <p>As Hillary Clinton tries to make her case for the highest office in the land, we hear from the FBI of cellphones smashed with hammers, wiped email servers and immunity deals for her closest advisers.</p> <p>She will raise taxes and put more burdensome regulations on business, ensuring our sluggish economy will remain just that. She has pledged to put coal miners out of business. More U.S. jobs will go overseas.</p> <p>The American people once again stand at a time for choosing. On one hand, we have a candidate in Hillary Clinton who represents all that is wrong with the status quo in Washington. On the other, Donald Trump has the courage to speak his mind and the boldness to make true his vision of a renewed America.</p> <p>On Election Day, the choice is clear. To Make America Great Again, we must elect Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States.</p> <p>Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is the Republican nominee for vice president.</p></article>

	<article id="0000731" published-at="2016-10-17" title="Democrats Worry About Hillary Clinton’s Ground Game">
Reuters <p>As <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> pulverized his own <a type="internal">Republican Party</a> on Twitter Tuesday afternoon, Congressional Democrats were having a conference call about how the election is shaping up in their states. A recent Wall Street Journal poll not only showed Trump cratering, it also revealed that congressional Democrats had widened their advantage over congressional Republicans to seven points.</p> <p>But the good vibes stopped when talk turned to Democrats’ get-out-the-vote efforts. “Somebody’s got to talk to the <a type="internal">Clinton campaign</a> and get them to do better with it,” one congressman said</p> <p>Several high-level Democrats who spoke to the Daily Beast are specifically concerned about Democrats’ ground game, which they worry may not be enough to ensure a victory for Clinton and down ballot Democrats in such a tumultuous election year.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has vastly outspent the Trump campaign on the air by five to one and boasts a ground game far superior to Trump’s. But in the field especially, Clinton has never measured up to the operation put in place by Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012. Some Democrats worry that just being better than Trump may not be enough for down-ticket Democrats in close races in November.</p> <p>“I am hearing from people that they are concerned about whether or not were properly or adequately funding our GOTV efforts,” Rep. Jim Clyburn, the third ranking Democrat in the House, said in an interview with the Daily Beast. “I’ve seen some good GOTV plans. On paper they’re great. The question is what about implementation? It’s one thing to see what you need to do, it’s something else to execute.”</p> <p>Clyburn said he has been traveling extensively for Democratic candidates the country and heard worries about the Democratic ground game in multiple battleground states, including Colorado, where a breakfast with faith leaders turned into conversation about worries over the Democrats’ GOTV effort there.</p> <p>“I’m really concerned about Florida, Colorado, and Ohio,” Clyburn said. “I just don’t want us to spend all of our money on television, where people are now tuning out commercials, and not do what’s necessary to turn people out.”</p> <p>Rep. G.K. Butterfield, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he has heard similar concerns and is specifically worried about the Clinton campaign’s investment in African American communities. Butterfield noted they could make the difference in a state like his home of North Carolina, which President Obama lost by 14,000 votes in 2012.</p> <p>“I don’t know why we have been unsuccessful in being able to make the case for a significant investment in grassroots get out the vote,” Butterfield said. “On the Clinton side and on the DSCC side, I’ve been trying to get them to increase their commitment. They have made some investments, but it’s not enough. “</p> <p>So far, the Clinton campaign has spent about $21 million on television ads in the state, but far less than the $300,000 Butterfield says could turnout 50,000 African American voters there.</p> <p>“I just want my friends who run national campaigns to know that it is the local communities that get the job done,” he said. “I think there’s an opinion that it’s not a good investment and that opinion is flawed.”</p> <p>The good news for Democrats is that the Clinton ground game is vastly superior to Donald Trump’s. A <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-clinton-field-offices/?ex_cid=538twitter" type="external">FiveThirtyEight analysis</a> shows that in terms of field offices, the Clinton operation is far outpacing Trump’s. Clinton has 489 field offices nationwide, compared to 207 offices for Trump.</p> <p>Clinton’s numbers don’t come close to replicating the Obama operation, which had 789 field offices in 2012. The pattern holds for battleground states. In Florida, Clinton has 68 offices, compared to for 29 Trump, but 103 for Obama. In Virginia, Obama had 61 offices, compared to Clinton’s 27 and Trump’s 11. In Ohio, she has 75, while Trump has 22. Obama had 131 Ohio field office.</p> <p>“Barack Obama had an army of volunteers in 2012. You could flip a switch and knock on one million doors in Florida in a weekend,” said a Democratic operative involved in GOTV efforts for the party in 2008, 20012, and 2016. “There is no Hillary army. Not even close. In tight races, that matters.”</p> <p>Democrats outside of the Clinton campaign are putting major cash into efforts to supplement GOTV in must-win states. Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer gave an additional $15 million, on top of $5 million he’d already sent, to For Our Future, a super PAC focused on expand Democrats’ field operations in Florida, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p> <p>Amanda Brown, the campaign director, said it is designed to turn out the Obama coalition that voted in 2008 and 2012, but skipped the mid-terms. “Voters who many feared wouldn’t show up this time—unless we met them at the door and talked to them about the issues they were most concerned about.”</p> <p>A Democrat familiar with the Clinton campaign acknowledged the differences between 2012 and this year, but said some of the changes are designed to help downballot races. “In 2012, there was no coordinated campaign, between the top of the ticket and the bottom,” the source said. “In 2016, they’re on all the literature. When Clinton does an event, they’re all invited and included. It’s a priority.”</p> <p>As for House Democrats, Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the ones on the Tuesday call that she understood the concern about down-ballot races and has shared it with the Clinton campaign. “We have had that conversation with them to say, don’t take anything for granted.”</p></article>
	<article id="0000733" published-at="2016-11-01" title="Michael Moore Is Worried About Hillary Clinton’s Chances: ‘The Lack of Enthusiasm Is Dangerous’">
Andy Kropa/AP Iamges <p><a type="internal">Michael Moore</a> doesn’t know if Donald Trump has seen his latest film, the anti-Trump documentary <a type="internal">Michael Moore in TrumpLand</a>, which the Fahrenheit 9/11 filmmaker rushed out into theaters and VOD last week in an eleventh-hour attempt to give Team Hillary Clinton a boost in the final weeks before Election Day. But he was certainly none too happy to see the Republican presidential candidate tweet as if the film was a ringing endorsement—which it definitely, absolutely, is not.</p> <p>“I haven’t spoken to him, so I don’t know if he just saw his name in the title and thought it was pro-him,” Moore told The Daily Beast on Monday from New York. “Was he stupid enough to tweet that without anybody having watched the film? Or is he just crazy as a fox?”</p> <p>Filmed over two nights in October, TrumpLand is a one-man stage show Moore began writing in August, spurred to action after seeing Democrats around him resting on their laurels a little too heavily following the Democratic convention. “I noticed the people that support Hillary were feeling really confident—and I thought that was dangerous,” he explained. “The more Trump screwed up and the more she won the debates, people just thought more and more that it was in the bag. I didn’t feel that way at all. I guess that’s because I live in Michigan and I see what’s going on and I’m not in an East Coast-West Coast bubble.”</p> <p>Moore’s idea was to make a point by performing his stand-up show in a Republican city. But the first theater he booked, in the Ohio town of Newark, reneged under pressure from irate local Republicans. He ended up staging it in Wilmington, Ohio, “which was even better because there are like 26,000 registered voters there and only 2,000 of them are registered as Democrats,” he giggled.</p> <p>Even better: The Wilmington venue, a historic local 400-seat theater, was partially restored with a $50,000 donation from Glenn Beck five years ago. Moore laughs with gratitude. “I do know that the theater took a lot of grief from the Republicans in their town—and there was a state senator who called and threatened to have their arts funding canceled if they didn’t cancel me.”</p> <p>They didn’t cancel. Eleven days later he premiered Michael Moore in TrumpLand in New York. Last weekend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMKiEjEhHfl/" type="external">Miley Cyrus Instagrammed a selfie</a> to her 1.2 million followers watching it, proclaiming “I’m with her!”—just the kind of viral support Moore was hoping for, aiming to rouse disappointed Bernie stumpers, undecided voters, non-voters, and third partiers leaning toward Trump to get excited about Hillary.</p> <p>“It’s also for the Hillary voters who are not very excited,” he added. “The lack of enthusiasm is dangerous.”</p> <p>“Ten percent of the Hillary vote got depressed with the FBI announcement,” he said, emphasizing that he “wouldn’t take any of it seriously at all.” The damage made by FBI Director James Comey declaring that more Clinton emails are under review, Moore says, is that the “irrelevant” emails have dampened the enthusiasm Hillary’s campaign still desperately needs.</p> <p>“They’re still going to vote for her,” he said of Clinton supporters, “but they’re not as enthusiastic, and maybe won’t do the work for her this weekend that they were going to.”</p> <p>Moore’s own position on Hillary has shifted dramatically over the years and through this election. He backed Bernie Sanders through the primary, dubbed Clinton “Wall Street’s paid candidate,” and said he couldn’t vote for her on moral grounds because of her record on Iraq. That Moore disappeared <a type="internal">sometime in the past few months</a>. But he says he’s always felt the same way about Hillary and her husband.</p> <p>“I really don’t think it has changed,” he said of his stance on Clinton. “I have a great deal of admiration for her. I felt that way back in the ’90s. I didn’t agree with her or Bill [Clinton] politically necessarily, but I didn’t distrust who they were as human beings. And I feel the same way right now.”</p> <p>“I feel that her vote on the war was wrong. I feel she’s too close to Wall Street. And I’m also excited that we’re going to elect the first woman president in our history.”</p> <p>Moore stresses the historical significance of putting a woman in the White House, even after catching heat online for tweeting that “no women ever invented an atomic bomb, built a smoke stack, initiated a Holocaust, melted the polar ice caps or organized a school shooting.”</p> <p>The blowback didn’t surprise Moore, who chalked some of the criticism to entrenched sexism from his fellow men. “A lot of men are having a hard time with what’s happening. A lot of white guys are having a hard time with it. Eight years of Obama were a huge blow [to them] and [electing a] woman is rattling around in their brains in a way that they can’t make sense out of it.”</p> <p>“But I only speak the truth,” he added. “I don’t see a lot of girls going into schools and shooting them up. There are two exceptions in 35 years. So of course you have an anomaly, always, for anything. Margaret Thatcher would start a war. But as I pointed out in my last film talking to the first woman president in Iceland, she said, when you have just one woman it’s a token and basically that person’s going to behave much like men behave because that’s how she got the token position. But when women have real power they don’t behave that way. And I’m not trying to say that women are better than men, I’m just trying to say that… women are better than men!”</p> <p>He considered the impact that third-party mobilization of millennials, in large part toward Sanders’s campaign, has had on this election season. His fellow Bernie supporters should rally behind Hillary, Moore said.</p> <p>“That Hillary then, that we did not like at the beginning of the year, moved toward Bernie’s position,” he mused. “She adopted two-thirds of his platform! It’s amazing. So I say to my fellow Bernie supporters, what more do you want? She’s gone more than halfway! And she isn’t Margaret Thatcher. What is your problem? Come on!”</p> <p>“There should be no anger,” he continued, his voice rising. “There should be joy, because we did something historic. We got a socialist elected in 22 states. Nearly half the states voted for a socialist for president. That is stunning! People shouldn’t be angry—they should be taking a bow. We set the tone of the whole election in terms of income inequality! If the Democrats win the Senate, the chairman of the budget committee is a guy named Bernie Sanders! A socialist will be in charge of the budget!”</p> <p>“If you’re angry about any of that, you need to see somebody.”</p> <p>Three days after <a type="internal">distancing himself from Julian Assange</a> on HBO’s Real Time With Bill Maher in the wake of WikiLeaks’s continued attacks on Clinton, Moore defended the organization and again called Assange an anarchist—just like Trump.</p> <p>“I think Julian and WikiLeaks perform a really important service and we can’t have it both ways,” Moore said. “We can’t say it’s OK when they expose the other side but not OK when they post things about our side. Having said that, I think that [Assange] and many of the people voting for Trump would like to see the system—nonviolently—blow up. I can see why Trump likes him, because Trump is essentially an anarchist. Trump is going to blow up the system with no plan for what he’s going to replace what he’s blown up. He has no real plans.”</p> <p>Moore’s touchstones for analyzing the tumultuous 2016 election, appropriately, parallel the viewing habits of America. It’s how he’s able to explain why he believes Trump has gotten this far in politics, the latest in a long lineage of Republican candidates plucked from show business to elected office.</p> <p>“I watch Celebrity Apprentice,” admitted Moore. “It’s a very good show. Trump is a well-liked, very popular TV star. And one thing the Republicans have learned—when they run Ronald Reagan, when they run Arnold Schwarzenegger—when they run stars, they win. Democrats don’t do that. We don’t run Oprah or Tom Hanks or any of a number of other people that would win. I’ve never understood that.”</p> <p>Moore would, for the record, get behind President Oprah Winfrey. “Hell yes! And bring back her show every afternoon at 4 o’clock from the Oval Office. How cool would that be?”</p> <p>He urges the Democrats to learn from the savvier GOP and put all that Hollywood liberalism to good use. “It drives me crazy,” said Moore. “Part of it is because they don’t understand popular culture, which is odd because Hollywood is so Democratic and so liberal—and yet they don’t understand their own power. In fact, they run from it when they get criticized. The American public loves Hollywood! There are three or four shows on at 7 p.m. about nothing but Hollywood news.”</p> <p>“I mean, listen,” he began. “Jennifer Hudson lost American Idol, and most people think she won. She lost to Fantasia. Who the fuck is Fantasia, and where is she now? I mean, seriously—anything can happen in this election. The American public is very fickle. Last year on The Bachelorette, everybody thought Kaitlyn was going to go for Nick, and she went with Shawn. That blew everyone’s mind.”</p> <p>“Well, that’s my warning about next Tuesday. We live in a country that loves The Bachelorette, Celebrity Apprentice, and American Idol; that sits in front of their TVs seven hours a day, and they do strange things. So take nothing for granted over the next eight days. Because this could go the wrong way very quickly.”</p></article>
	<article id="0000734" published-at="2016-11-07" title="Common: America’s Racism Toward Black People Won’t End With Donald Trump">
Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast <p>There is a sequence in 13th, <a type="internal">Ava DuVernay’s</a> thorough examination <a type="internal">of race in the U.S. criminal-justice system</a> and the scourge of mass incarceration, that will hit close to home for Americans—particularly viewers who are black.It intercuts footage of black people being pushed, pulled, and beaten in the streets during the civil-rights movement with that of black protesters being treated in a similar fashion during Donald Trump rallies. “In the good ol’ days, this doesn’t happen, because they used to treat them very, very rough… and when they protested once, they would not do it again so easily,” Trump bellows in voiceover.</p> <p>Later on, he describes himself to his army of hysterical acolytes as the “law and order” candidate, borrowing a notorious phrase from disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon—the godfather of mass incarceration.</p> <p>The footage had a profound effect on the <a type="internal">Grammy-winning rapper Common</a>, who penned the track “Letter to the Free” for DuVernay’s film. It was his second collaboration with DuVernay, following <a type="internal">his song “Glory”</a> for the Martin Luther King, Jr. biopic Selma, which was awarded the Oscar for Best Original Song.</p> <p>“I really thought about how this situation is affecting us right now, that’s why I wrote Shot me with your ray-gun / And now you want to Trump me, and We staring in the face of hate again / The same they say will make America great again,” says Common. “When I heard Trump in his speech saying he was the ‘law and order candidate,’ it really resonated with me when it came to Nixon and the origins of mass incarceration.”</p> <p>13th indeed traces the birth of mass incarceration in the U.S. back to Nixon’s War on Drugs, which targeted the enemies of the conservative right: hippies and black people.</p> <p>“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,” former Nixon domestic-policy chief John Ehrlichman <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/" type="external">later confessed to Harper’s</a>. “We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”</p> <p>And so the era of mass incarceration began—one where, from 1980 to 2010, the U.S. prison incarceration rate exploded from 220 to 731 per 100,000 people, despite crime rates steadily declining since the ’90s. The problem has affected black Americans the most: They represent approximately 37.8 percent of the U.S. prison population—the most of any group. Non-Hispanic whites, by comparison, represent 32 percent of the prison population in America despite making up 62.6 percent of the country. 13th is named after the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which outlawed slavery, and posits that mass incarceration is a form of modern-day slavery for African Americans.</p> <p>“Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,” reads the Thirteenth Amendment.</p> <p>Common had just finished reading Michelle Alexander’s book The New Jim Crow when DuVernay informed him of the top-secret project. He expressed his desire to make a song for the film, and was met with a surprising response: “OK, maybe you can submit a song. Let’s see.”So he began writing “Letter to the Free” during the last week of July and into the first week in August, inspired by the divisive rhetoric of the Republican National Convention, as well as how the system has kept African Americans as second-class citizens—from slavery to Jim Crow to now mass incarceration.</p> <p>“I was influenced by this whole political climate, the conditions of mass incarceration, and the injustices going on that even allow us to have a group called Mothers of the Movement,” offers Common. “They continue to drive me towards art that can be a part of the change.”</p> <p>On the eve of the U.S. presidential election, I’m seated across from the dapper rapper in an office in Midtown Manhattan. The talk soon veers back to that powerful Trump/civil-rights movement montage, and how the Republican candidate has brought racism out of the shadows and into the light.</p> <p>“I look at these things as finally surfacing and getting out in the open. Those negative forces weren’t courageous enough to come out before because they didn’t have any leader to latch on to,” he says. “You take the racists in our country right now and see that they are supporting Trump, who has not shown any of the qualities to be a great leader, and you think, wow, he is unfit to be president. He’s not even going to run the country better for them because he doesn’t have the intelligence to be president.”</p> <p>He shakes his head. “The whole birther shit man, it’s like, you are saying this to the president! What is your motive? Whose life will you benefit by doing this? It’s just racism. President Obama is an exceptional human being, so there’s only one reason and one explanation for all the hatred.”</p> <p>Common, whose eleventh studio album, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/black-america-again/id1163929261" type="external">Black America Again</a>, was released to critical acclaim last week, went on to admonish Trump’s wacky band of surrogates for supporting a candidate they know to be unfit—especially former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who’s spouted one ridiculous statement after another this election season, including that he’s <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rudy-giuliani-ive-saved-more-black-lives-than-beyonce-w436809" type="external">“saved more black lives” than Beyoncé</a>, which… huh?“You’re going to lose all integrity for someone you know is not fit to be president? You’re willing to lose your integrity, lie about things, and discredit other human beings for that reason? Giuliani says a lot of things about Black Lives Matter and it’s like, man, you don’t even care about these things, so why are you speaking on it?” says Common.</p> <p>“Look, we know it will be a bad situation if Donald Trump becomes president, but we gotta keep working and finding out what to do, because the world isn’t going to end,” he adds. “People say he’ll push a button and end the world, but there are still great people in this country, so I’m not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I still have hope.”</p> <p>One thing that’s reaffirmed Common’s faith in America is the reaction to 13th, which has received heaps of praise following its release on Netflix, and is a frontrunner for the Best Documentary Oscar.</p> <p>“When the movie came out, I had friends calling me up to tell me they were spending their weekend watching a documentary on mass incarceration. And it really made me hopeful for the future of this country,” says Common.</p> <p>He then begins to choke up. “At the New York Film Festival premiere, I was standing on the balcony with Ava and Van Jones, and when the curtain went up it all hit me and I started crying. I felt the pain that a lot of black people have been through in this country and thought, wow man, we are really loving people.”</p></article>
	<article id="0000735" published-at="2016-11-09" title="Can Comedy Survive President Trump?">
Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast <p>Just before midnight on the east coast Tuesday night, Donald Trump finally stopped being hilarious.</p> <p>Judd Apatow summed it up best on Twitter. While there is sometimes a feeling among comedians that comedy can heal all wounds, there was nothing funny about what had just happened in America.</p> <q> <p>One thing I do not want to watch right now-- comedy about any of this. That's how terrifying and disappointing this is.</p>— Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddApatow/status/796206021328846848" type="external">November 9, 2016</a> </q> <p>Most of the late-night shows had the luxury of taking election night off, but <a type="internal">there was The Daily Show’s shellshocked young host Trevor Noah</a>, live on Comedy Central telling anyone who might have tuned in looking to laugh that they had come to the wrong place. “I genuinely do not understand how America can be this disorganized or this hateful,” he said. The pre-written jokes that followed mostly fell flat.</p> <p>Over on Showtime, Stephen Colbert hosted a <a type="internal">live, profanity-filled election night special of his own</a>. But the proceedings lacked the <a type="internal">urgently jubilant nature of his election eve show</a>, which featured both Jon Stewart and the lead of Broadway’s Hamilton urging viewers to go out and vote to prevent “that angry tax- and draft-dodging little orange groundhog” from becoming president.</p> <p>By the end of his hour Tuesday night, the jokes were over and Colbert was reduced to nervously pacing behind his desk and ranting philosophically about the “poisonous” nature of our politics. As planned, he concluded with a silly bit about the things all Americans should be able to agree on. “You cannot laugh and be afraid at the same time,” he said. “And the devil cannot stand mockery.” But for many of those on the losing side, it just felt too soon to laugh.</p> <p>It wasn’t supposed to be this way. If there was any upside to Trump defeating Clinton it was that his sheer ridiculousness would be a boon to comedy. Like President Obama, Hillary Clinton has not been the easiest figure to make fun of—though Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon did <a type="internal">achieve something magical</a> with an impression that we are unlikely to see any more of after this week.</p> <p>But Trump has been a goldmine for late-night television, from John Oliver’s <a type="internal">most-watched-ever #MakeAmericaDrumpfAgain takedown</a> to Seth Meyers’s nightly <a type="internal">“closer looks” at Trump’s horrific behavior</a> to Samantha Bee’s <a type="internal">too-convincing conspiracy theory that #TrumpCantRead</a>. In every case, the jokes were funny because we all knew this man would never actually be president… right?</p> <p>His ultimately doomed quest for legitimacy was also the cornerstone of President Obama’s most searing jokes about Trump, from the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner speech that many believe drove him to run to his <a type="internal">#phonedrop moment on Jimmy Kimmel Live</a> just a few weeks ago. In response to a “mean tweet” from Trump about Obama being “perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States,” the president replied, “Really? Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president.”</p> <p>See what I mean? Not so funny anymore.</p> <p>It is also notable that while SNL was one of the only comedy shows that found a way to make Hillary Clinton funny, they never quite managed to do the same with Donald Trump. The type of satire that show trades in works when there is something to heighten, whether it’s Dana Carvey’s manic George H.W. Bush or Will Ferrell’s dimwitted George W. Bush. But over time, as our real-life politicians have moved closer to parody, their job has gotten more difficult. Tina Fey’s Sarah Palin impression was really only funny <a type="internal">because of how accurate it was</a>. The same can be said for Alec Baldwin’s Donald Trump.</p> <p>“He’s the head writer of his own comedy routine,” Baldwin said of Trump on Election Day in his first interview about the SNL portrayal with WNYC’s Brian Lehrer. “When we sit down and think about what to say, and the writers write down what to say, Trump is supplying them all the material that they need.”</p> <p>But as we learned after the novelty of Baldwin’s technically accurate impression wore off, there was <a type="internal">nothing inherently funny</a> about hearing him elaborate on Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” rhetoric. Even Baldwin grew weary of embodying Trump, <a type="internal">breaking character in what he thought would be his final appearance</a> as the candidate this past Saturday to apologize to McKinnon for being so awful toward her this whole time. “Don’t you guys just feel gross all the time about this?” he asked.</p> <p>Now, SNL has to decide how to handle President Trump. They <a type="internal">got rid of Taran Killam</a>, who briefly played Trump last year before he was <a type="internal">replaced by Darrell Hammond</a>, who was in turn cast aside in favor of Baldwin. In his interview with Lehrer, Baldwin said he “hoped” his run as Trump was over, indicating that if Clinton won, he would be done, but if she lost, he would likely be back for just one more episode. “I want my weekends back so I can go be with my kids,” he said, wearily.</p> <p>Perhaps SNL can just <a type="internal">do what they did in September of 2015</a> and have Donald Trump play Donald Trump from now on.</p> <p>Of course, all of these aforementioned shows, and others that are bound to pop up in opposition to him—looking at you female, Latino, and Muslim comedians—will find a way to make Trump funny again. But will a man who has praised authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin tolerate being the target of satire?</p> <p>Trump once <a type="internal">sued Bill Maher</a> for joking that his father was a orangutan. Four months ago, Trevor Noah told me that if Trump were to become president the future of The Daily Show could be in jeopardy. “I mean, this is the same man who says he wants to open up the libel laws,” he said, “change them so that people like you and me can be sued if he feels that what we’re saying about him is damaging—even if it’s based in fact.”</p> <p>The night before the election, Samantha Bee aired the <a type="internal">second part of her series from Moscow</a>, which highlighted the parallels between Trump and Putin, who has all but eliminated satire from Russia. “The only worse thing for a dictator than being criticized, is being laughed at,” one pro-democracy Russian journalist told her.</p> <p>“But that could never happen here,” Bee said, optimistically, before revealing Trump’s calls for SNL to be canceled after he took issue with Baldwin’s harsh portrayal of him.</p> <p>Let me preface this next statement by saying that I do not equate the election of Donald Trump to the highest office in the land with the killing of thousands of innocent Americans. But there was something about the way we started to see late-night hosts grapple with President-elect Trump—and will see several more do so tonight—that was reminiscent of those first few comedy shows after the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>Something has happened in this country that doesn’t feel remotely funny and yet there are comedians who are tasked with going on television and trying to navigate their way through the abyss. Don’t be surprised if the late-night shows are at a loss for comedy once again tonight.</p> <p>On September 20th, 2001, Jon Stewart sat behind his desk at The Daily Show and choked back tears as he said, “This show in general, we feel like is a privilege. Just even the idea that we can sit in the back of the country and make wise cracks, which is really what we do. We sit in the back and we throw spitballs, but never forgetting the fact that it is a luxury in this country that allows us to do that. A country that allows for open satire, and I know that sounds basic and it sounds as though it goes without saying—but that’s really what this whole situation is about.”</p> <p>We can only hope at this point that America’s new president will come to see it the same way.</p></article>

	<article id="0000738" published-at="2017-06-01" title="LeBron James Delivers Powerful -- And Needed -- Response To Hate Crime">
LeBron James <p>One day before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, LeBron James' Los Angeles house was vandalized with racial slurs. James did not open his Wednesday afternoon press conference with a statement about his house. But when asked about it, he had a response that was heartfelt, thoughtful and measured -- which is exactly what we've come to expect from him.</p> <p>"If this is to shed a light and continue to keep the conversation going on my behalf, then I'm OK with it," James <a href="http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=130356" type="external">opened</a> in Oakland.</p> <p>James has been a big part of that conversation himself the past few years as one of the most prominent athletes to take political stands.</p> <p>When Trayvon Martin was shot, James were a black hoodie during warmups. When Eric Garner was killed, James wore an "I CAN'T BREATHE" T-shirt. As police shootings and the 2016 presidential campaign brought aspects of racism to the forefront, James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul spoke on race and violence at the ESPYs. James wrote a column to articulate his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president.</p> <p>"It just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America," James continued. "And hate in America, especially for African Americans, is living every day. And even though that it's concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you, and when they see you, they smile in your face, it's a life every single day.</p> <p>"And I think back to Emmett Till's mom, actually. It's kind of one of the first things I thought of, and the reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America.</p> <p>"So it's like it doesn't -- no matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is -- it's tough. And we got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans, until we feel equal in America. But my family is safe, and that's what's important."</p> <q> <p>LeBron James shares thoughts on his Los Angeles house getting vandalized. <a href="https://t.co/4RFLK42xhu" type="external">pic.twitter.com/4RFLK42xhu</a></p> </q> <p>LeBron James is not Muhammad Ali. He is not traveling the world fighting injustices in impoverished nations. He is not Colin Kaepernick, staging a protest before every game.</p> <p>But when he speaks about important issues, his words have impact -- and it's not just because he's a celebrity. He educates himself and has substantial opinions. He is cognizant of his voice and is mindful of when to use it.</p> <p>Last fall, a reporter asked James about Kaepernick's national anthem protests. James said he would not kneel, but recognized the need for Kaepernick to have that freedom. He then transitioned the conversation to a personal thought James had been having -- an example other black parents could relate to.</p> <p>"You have the right to voice your opinion, stand for your opinion, and he's doing it in the most peaceful way I've ever seen someone do something," James <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/17646037/lebron-james-supports-colin-kaepernick-right-protest-stand-anthem" type="external">said then</a>. "For me, my personal feelings is that I got a 12-year-old son, a 9-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter, and I look at my son being four years removed from driving his own car and being able to leave the house on his own, and it's a scary thought right now to think if my son gets pulled over. You tell your kids if you just apply [the lessons you teach them] and if you just listen to the police that they will be respectful and it will work itself out. And you see these videos that continue to come out, and it's a scary-ass situation that if my son calls me and says that he's been pulled over that I'm not that confident that things are going to go well and my son is going to return home. And my son just started the sixth grade."</p> <p>James has his haters -- from both sides. There are people who feel that he's just an athlete who should stick to sports. Then there are people who think James does not do enough with his mega-reach to create legitimate progress.</p> <p>If you're among those who wished James would have gone even deeper into this subject Wednesday, consider that basketball is still his priority, particularly this week when he needs to focus on figuring out how to guard Kevin Durant.</p> <p>But James made it clear again Wednesday that if he can be this engaged in political dialogue while he's still playing in the NBA, we can only expect even more once he's retired.</p> <p>Share</p> <p>Tweet</p> <p>Post</p> <p>Email</p></article>

Rep. Steve King (@TPM via Twitter screenshot) <p>On Thursday I wrote about Roy Moore <a type="internal">waxing nostalgic about the days of slavery</a>. And every day, The Root covers something crazy that the current sitting president has said. This current regime is not attempting to hide its racist overtones, and this latest incident is no exception: A Republican congressman from Iowa tweeted from his verified account Friday that “diversity is not our strength.” I’m not making this up.</p> <p>Let me give you some background on Iowa Rep. Steve King. He is the person who <a type="internal">sponsored the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017</a>, an amendment to the federal criminal code that makes it a crime for any physician “to knowingly perform an abortion: (1) without determining whether the fetus has a detectable heartbeat, (2) without informing the woman of the results, or (3) after determining that a fetus has a detectable heartbeat.”</p> <p>Clearly, King doesn’t believe in women being in charge of their own vaginas, and if his tweet is any indication, he doesn’t want them sharing their vaginas outside of their race, either.</p> <p>“Diversity is not our strength. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, ‘Mixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one,’” King wrote, linking to an article referencing the Orban quote.</p> <p>If you are unfamiliar with Orbán, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/list/politico-28/viktor-orban/" type="external">Politico describes him</a> as a “conservative subversive.” He is anti-immigrant and has installed razor wire fencing and water cannons at his borders.</p> <p>If King thinks that Orbán is an example to follow, that tells us everything we need to know about him, even if his latest tweets didn’t already.</p> <p>King followed up the diversity tweet by writing, “Assimilation has become a dirty word to the multiculturalist left. Assimilation, not diversity, is our American strength.”</p> <p>Of course, the people of Twitter had strong reactions to King’s statements, as well they should.</p> <p>We should be very afraid that this is what we have in our so-called representative government, which is purportedly built “of the people, by the people.”</p></article>

	<article id="0000742" published-at="2017-12-05" title="Which Presidents Were Left-Handed?">
James Garfield, Twentieth President of the United States. Credit: Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, LC-BH82601-1484-B DLC <p>There have been eight left-handed presidents that we know of. However, this number is not necessarily accurate because in the past left-handedness was actively discouraged. Many individuals who would have grown up left-handed were in fact forced to learn how to write with their right hand. And, if recent history is any indication, left-handedness seems to be far more common among U.S. presidents than it is among the general population. Naturally, this apparent phenomenon has led to many speculations.</p> <p><a type="internal">James Garfield</a> (March-September 1881) is considered by many to be the first president who was left-handed. Anecdotes indicate that he was ambidextrous and could write with both hands at the same time. However, he served only six months before succumbing to gunshot wounds after Charles Guiteau shot him in July of his first term.</p> <p>What is perhaps most noteworthy about left-handed presidents is how many there have been in recent decades. Of the last 15 presidents, seven (about 47%) have been left-handed. That might not mean much until you consider that the global percentage of left-handed people is about 10%. So among the general population, only 1 in 10 people are left-handed, while in the modern-era White House, almost 1 in 2 have been left-handed. And there's every reason to believe that this trend will continue because it's no longer standard practice to steer children away from natural left-handedness.</p> <p>A quick count of political parties in the list above shows the Republicans slightly ahead of the Democrats, with five of the eight lefties being Republican. If the numbers were reversed, perhaps someone would argue that left-handed people are more in line with left politics. After all, many people believe that left-handedness seems to correspond to creative, or at least "out of the box" thinking, pointing to famous lefty artist such as Pablo Picasso, Jimi Hendrix and Leonardo Di Vinci. While this theory obviously wouldn't be supported by the history of left-handed presidents, the unusually high percentage of lefties in the White House may point to other characteristics that may give lefties an edge in leadership roles (or at least at winning elections):</p> Language development: According to scientists Sam Wang and Sandra Aamodt, authors of Welcome to Your Brain, 1 in 7 left-handed people use both hemispheres (left and right) of their brain to process language, while almost all right-handed people process language on only the left side of the brain (the left side controls the right hand, and vice versa). It's possible that this "ambidextrous" language processing gives lefties an advantage as orators. Creative thinking: Studies have shown a correlation between left-handedness and creative thinking, or more specifically, divergent thinking, or an aptitude for developing multiple solutions to problems. Chris McManus, author of Right-Hand, Left-Hand, suggests that left-handedness may be associated with a more highly developed right hemisphere of the brain, the side that's better at creative thinking. This may also explain the over representation of <a type="internal">left-handed artists</a>. <p>So, if you're a lefty who gets annoyed with all the right-handed bias in the world, perhaps you can help change things as our next president.</p></article>

	<article id="0000745" published-at="2016-10-07" title="BOOM! Wikileaks Confirms Hillary Sold Weapons To ISIS."><p>Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is a controversial character. But there’s no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and he’s willing to expose Hillary Clinton.Now, he’s announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria.</p> <p>Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.</p> <p>WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested:</p> <q> <p>The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua.</p> <p>In Obama’s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.</p> <p>Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called “Friends of Syria” (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.</p> <p>Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack.</p> <p>In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks’ Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.</p> </q> <p>Here is the incredible transcript:</p> <q> <p>JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what’s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?</p> <p>JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn’t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it’s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case—or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We can’t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.</p> <p>So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails. There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.</p> </q> <p>It appears that Hillary Clinton committed perjury, just like her husband was caught doing as President.</p></article>

She has a huge problem with folks like Ferguson, or Donald Trump, telling NFL players they should stand for the national anthem.</p> <p>Ferguson made the case that our national leaders should not attend a football game where players are disrespecting the country they took an oath to defend. He likens kneeling against the flag as “basically giving the middle finger to the men and women who have fought to protect this country.” Therefore, a president should be able to speak out against such actions.</p> <p>CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield also made her disagreement with Ferguson known and attempted to correct him for having an opinion. But Sanders was too loud to control.</p> <p>“You should be ashamed for perpetuating this lie,” Sanders said.</p> <p>Whitfield laughed and agreed, “Yeah, nobody’s done that,” referring to the middle finger comment.</p> <p>Ferguson presented further arguments which really allowed Sanders ideology to come to light:</p> <q> <p>“White people do not get to tell black folks, or anybody else, what is an acceptable form of protest.”</p> </q> <p>“Not everything is about race, Symone,” Ferfuson retorted.</p> <p>“Maybe not for you, it is,” Sanders fired back.</p> <p>Before Sanders spewed racism on national television, she was doing it behind the scenes as press secretary for Bernie Sanders. Go figure.</p></article>

Trump was accompanied by his wife, Melania, who gave a speech which seemed to borrow from one previously given by the first lady.</p> <p>“Future first lady Melania was there for a private meeting with Michelle Obama to ensure the peaceful transition of speeches,” Colbert said.</p> <p>The Late Late Show with James Corden</p> <p>In his monologue given on “Day 2: Acceptance,” James Corden dissected Trump’s visit to the White House beginning with Trump’s airplane departure which included a water cannon salute.</p> <p>“What a lot of people don’t know is those water cannons are actually filled with the tears of Democrats,” said Corden, a man who has apparently never heard the phrase “too soon.”</p> <p>The late-night host also joked that a photo of the president and president-elect not smiling was their attempt to slay the mannequin challenge.</p></article>

News of the hiring by the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, which was first reported by <a href="http://www.fox32chicago.com/news/local/114672405-story" type="external">WFLD</a>-TV in Chicago, has spurred outrage from activists in the city.</p> <p>The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Catholic priest and prominent activist on the city's South Side, called the move by the union "a disgrace" and a setback for efforts to restore fraught relations between the police department and the African-American community.</p> <p>"The Police Union says to Chicago ... we don't give a damn what he did, what you think, he is one of ours, and we are going to take care of him," Pfleger wrote on his Facebook page.</p> <p>The union has shown support for Van Dyke since he was charged on the same day the city was forced by court order to release chilling dashcam video that showed Van Dyke, who is white, fire 16 shots at the black teen.

USA TODAY NETWORK</p> <p>WASHINGTON — The White House professed its neutrality Monday in the growing debate over FBI Director James Comey's decision to notify Congress that he had resumed the agency's investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails.</p> <p>"I’ll neither defend nor criticize what Director Comey has decided to communicate to the public about his decision," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after speaking to Obama about the issue. He described Obama as "pretty even-keeled" about the news, even in the midst of his aggressive campaign schedule on Clinton's behalf.</p> <p>Earnest's statement came amid growing criticism of Comey's handling of the investigation, both from Democrats and even some Republicans.</p> <p>"Director Comey is a man of integrity, he's a man of principle, and he's a man of good character," Earnest said. "He's in a tough spot. And he's the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism."</p> <p>The FBI does not usually notify Congress about pending investigations. But in a letter to congressional committees Friday, Comey said he felt obliged to do so because he had previously testified that the investigation had been completed.</p> <p>Justice Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the FBI discovered Clinton emails on a computer co-owned by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her now-estranged husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner. The FBI is investigating Weiner's communications with an underage girl.</p> <p>The Democratic presidential nominee's emails have been a campaign issue since The New York Times reported that she used a private email server to send and receive official emails, many of which turned out to be classified.</p> <p>In between the lines of Earnest's non-criticism of Comey, however, were suggestions that the White House isn't entirely happy with how Comey has handled the emails. Comey's July news conference contained "some rather harsh condemnations" of Clinton, and much of his subsequent congressional testimony "provided fodder to Secretary Clinton's critics," Earnest said.</p> <p>He said Obama believes the FBI director's substantial authority to conduct investigations should be "tempered by an adherence to longstanding tradition and practice and norms that limit public discussion of facts that are collected in the context of those investigations."</p> <p>But Earnest also said President Obama does not believe that Comey intended to influence the election, or that he was "secretly strategizing" to benefit Clinton's opponent, Donald Trump. That would suggest that Obama does not believe Comey violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their office to intentionally influence an election, and which would give Obama grounds to remove Comey from office.</p> <p>Obama nominated Comey as FBI director in 2013.</p></article>

It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted."</p> <p>The first lady said it would be "dishonest" and "disingenuous" for her "to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream."</p> <p>"It's not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season," she added of the Trump recording.</p> <p>She also seemed to allude to reports that surfaced Wednesday night in The New York Times and elsewhere of women accusing Trump of sexual misconduct in years past, saying that "it now seems very clear" the recording released last Friday wasn't "an isolated incident."</p> <p>"I listen to all of this, and I feel it so personally," she said, adding that women, in particular, likely felt the same way.</p> <p>"The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, the belief that you can do anything you want to a woman — it is cruel, it's frightening, and the truth is, it hurts," she said of Trump's comments.</p> <p>Following her remarks at the Democratic convention, the percentage of Americans who said they viewed the first lady favorably rose to 64%, according to a Gallup survey, a figure that makes her far more popular than either of the presidential nominees. During that speech, Obama, without naming him, asserted that Trump was unfit to fulfill the role of national role model.</p> <p>"This election, and every election, is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives," the first lady said. "And I am here tonight because in this election, there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility, only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be president of the United States, and that is our friend, Hillary Clinton."</p> <p>Obama revisited that theme Thursday in New Hampshire, laying out what she said were the stakes for the nation's children.</p> <p>“In our hearts, we all know that if we let Hillary’s opponent win in this election, that we are sending a clear message to our kids: that everything they’re seeing and hearing is perfectly OK," she said.</p> <p>"We're telling our sons that it's OK to humiliate women," the first lady said. "We're telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated. We're telling all our kids that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country."</p> <p>She added: "If we have a president who routinely degrades women, who brags about sexually assaulting women, then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world?"</p> <p>Watch her speech below (beginning just after the 25-minute mark):</p></article>

VPC</p> <p>Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated German Chancellor Angela Merkel's first name.</p> <p>The terrorist attack on the satirical weekly in Paris threatens to create deeper animosities between Europe's growing Muslim minority and a native population that is increasingly embracing anti-Islam and anti-immigration movements.</p> <p>"The radicals are trying to exacerbate tensions that are already there," said Jonathan Laurence, author of Integrating Islam: Political and Religious Challenges in Contemporary France. "They're trying to drive a wedge between Muslims and the West."</p> <p>From France and Germany to Sweden and the United Kingdom, a backlash is spreading against Muslim immigrants, including tens of thousands of recent refugees from Syria's long civil war.</p> <p>In France, which has Western Europe's largest Muslim community, the anti-immigration National Front Party won 25% of the vote in the most recent elections in May, and radical anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim protests have taken place in multiple German cities in recent days.</p> <p>Until now, those and similar movements in other Western European countries have focused on limiting immigration and protecting the rights of publications to criticize Islam. They also have tried to halt what they view as excessive accommodations to Muslim culture: the use of Arabic language, headscarves worn by women, establishment of mosques, and serving halal food in school cafeterias.</p> <p>Wednesday's attack will provide a security element to those arguments, said Laurence, who teaches political science at Boston College. It "ties a foreign threat of violence in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and Libya and brings it home and raises the conflict temperature to a dangerous levels within Europe," he said.</p> <p>Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center on Freedom at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also predicted greater cultural conflicts in Europe. "It's inevitable there are going to be greater tensions now in France," Gardiner said. "These attacks will elevate the issue of homegrown jihadists to the top of the political agenda."</p> <p>A similar discourse will take place all over Europe, as it has already in the United Kingdom, Gardiner said. "There's a massive homegrown terrorist threat in the U.K. It's also an issue in Belgium, Holland, Germany and across Western Europe," he said. "This attack will up the stakes."</p> <p>French and other European officials have warned of heightened terrorist threats from citizens who identify with radical Islamist groups in North Africa and the Middle East, while political and populist leaders have railed against their countries' immigration policies, which they've characterized as lax and threatening to European culture.</p> <p>The attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, which poked fun at Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox Jewish clerics, fits into a pattern of radical Muslim reprisals against European critics in the world of culture.</p> <p>In 1989, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa (legal decree) calling for the death of author Salman Rushdie over his allegedly blasphemous portrayal of Islam's prophet Mohammed. Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered in 2004 for his film, Submission, about the treatment of women in Islam. And Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard escaped an assassination attempt in 2010 for his 2005 cartoon portrayal of the prophet, which caused riots and protests across the Muslim world.</p> <p>Thousands of Germans took part this week in anti-immigration rallies in Dresden, Berlin and Cologne, organized by a group known as PEGIDA, a German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. Germany's political establishment, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, denounced the rallies as undemocratic and hateful.</p> <p>The group was started by PEGIDA leader Lutz Bachmann in October to protest plans to add 14 centers for about 2,000 refugees in Dresden. Demonstrators reject charges they are far-right extremists or neo-Nazis. They say they are concerned by an influx of 200,000 refugees in 2014, many from war-torn Syria.</p> <p>Similar sentiments have been expressed in Sweden by members of the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats Party, which centrist parties sought to isolate and weaken last month by forming a broad parliamentary coalition. In France, the National Front Party headed by Marine Le Pen has gained support among working-class voters who believe the mainstream politicians have failed to address their concerns about crime, immigration and jobs.</p> <p>"There's a growing sense across France that immigration laws have been too weak," Gardiner said.</p> <p>He predicted that French officials would crack down on preachers of hate in radical mosques in Paris and other large French cities, and on French citizens seeking to fight with radical Islamist groups in Iraq or Syria. Whether that means far-right groups gain support depends on French President Francois Hollande's response, Gardiner said.</p> <p>France has been at the forefront of European nations in the fight against Islamist extremists in the Middle East and North Africa, focusing on its former 20th-century colonies. Hollande sent 3,000 troops to Mali to battle Islamist extremists who'd taken over a large swath of that former colony. He also joined the U.S.-led coalition launching airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. And on Monday, Hollande said he would strike at Islamist militants in Libya who try to cross or send weapons into neighboring Niger, where France has a base.</p> <p>France's domestic immigration issues also stem from its colonial past, including a civil war for independence from French control in Algeria that led to a flood of refugees into France in the early 1960s.</p> <p>"France has this colonial legacy to deal with when negotiating the integration of the millions of descendants of these colonial subjects," author Laurence said. "It's a political problem. What the violence does is prevent a political solution because it tends to polarize and make it appear the problem is not resolvable politically and can only be resolved militarily."</p></article>
	<article id="0000756" published-at="2016-10-13" title="Trump’s Speech: Dog Whistles to the Sovereign-Citizen Set">
Trump’s Thursday speech marked a turning point. There is now no scenario in which this country repudiates him and merely goes about its business. <p>It’s easy to forget how silly most people thought <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> was, all the way back in January. It was before any primaries or caucuses. Trump led in most polls, but people still couldn’t really quite believe that people were actually going to vote for him.</p> <p>I spent much of that month at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, <a type="internal">reporting for The Daily Beast</a> on the militants who had taken it over. In the intervening months, Trump has morphed from a vague joke or a thumb in the eye of the establishment, depending on your point of view, to a fascist megalomaniacal wreck of a candidate who is unlikely to be elected because he is fundamentally incapable of seeing past his own nose.</p> <p>As Trump has become an ever-more-worrisome figure, you can track his descent into right-wing madness easily. There were the Red Meat days, where he was merely a bigot. Then came the alt-right phase, the joyous celebration of Daddy Trump and Pepe the Frog and the oven jokes on Twitter. Trump has by now lied so often and so blatantly that many people thought it a little joke when <a type="internal">we found out he’d bragged about sexually assaulting women</a>. Of course he did, he’s Donald Trump.</p> <p>But for once the man was telling the truth, and in the last day or so America has watched with dawning horror as we realize that if he wasn’t lying about being a sex criminal, perhaps he has not been lying about the walls and the deportations and the locking up of his political opponents. Maybe he’s actually been telling the truth about himself this whole time.</p> <p>I watched his speech Thursday, and if I closed my eyes, I could smell the campfire smoke at the Malheur refuge and feel the Oregon winter wind on my face. Here were the conspiracies, the references to the shadowy international cabals, the whispers about the illegitimacy of the Department of Justice and the Trilateralist coopting of the FBI.</p> <p>It was like listening to an immodest Ammon Bundy. We have to protect ourselves from not just the government (because it is only a pawn) but from the people who really run it. We should be watchful, resilient, ready—and though he is reluctant, he will sacrifice himself, for he is the only one who can save us from the terror.</p> <p>Donald Trump shouted out every fevered dystopian fantasy I heard on the refuge, with the exceptions of Agenda 21 and abortion as population control. “They control the Department of Justice,” he said. “They have essentially corrupted the director of the FBI.” “This is a conspiracy against you, the American people, and we cannot let this happen or continue. This is our moment of reckoning.” This is precisely the logic that led a few hundred people to take up arms against the government in Oregon, though at least Ammon Bundy started with a reasonably legitimate premise. Donald Trump doesn’t even have two Americans jailed twice for the same crime to legitimize his quest.</p> <p>What he has is a small but growing fringe that talks about We the People instead of Americans. We have already seen the violence at his rallies, we have seen the vicious street attacks, we have worried about the rise of the right. What I have not until Thursday heard was something that spiked my nativist upbringing, words delivered in a very particular order that made me want to go buy another rifle and check my food storage.</p> <p>I was raised among white people, sent to an elementary school in which there were no black kids, and then moved to the mountains of Utah for high school, where the neo-Nazis recruited at illicit drinking parties because kids who would have a beer were already disaffected in an overwhelmingly Mormon culture. There is a part of me that remembers the coding, the tones, remembers the fear that the government might come and massacre us again as they had in times not that long ago. I reject it violently, but you don’t ever forget what you were raised to believe even if you learn better.</p> <p>It would take a linguist to comb through that speech and parse out which words came from where. I am only a writer steeped in the language of right-wing revolution. I was outraged by Trump before. But now I am worried. There is no scenario in which this country repudiates him and then goes about its business; we allowed his rise and we have emboldened the people that we ignored for so long. We have three weeks to go yet, more scandals and reactions and fear and terror, and at the end of it, we will have an unknowable number of people who will absolutely and without question think that Hillary Clinton’s election is an unmistakable sign that it is time for the governed to withdraw their consent.</p> <p>Not a majority; not even many, compared to the millions of people who live in America. But enough. Thursday, Donald Trump traveled a step further down the path of militant right-wing revolution. It wasn’t a call to arms, exactly. But it was far past the point of comfort.</p></article>

Although two investigations were opened by the FBI in regards to this crime nothing came from either one. Now, it’s time for a third investigation to be conducted by the DOJ and things aren’t looking good for Clinton this time around.</p> <p>According to reports, the Justice Department reopened the investigation into Clinton’s homebrewed email server. Suddenly, it appears Clinton may not be in the clear after all.</p> <p>From the Daily Wire:</p> <p>“The Justice Department has reopened the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified material on her private email system while she was secretary of state, and is considering offering her a plea bargain if she will agree to plead guilty to charges of breaking the law, according to a Clinton attorney,”</p> <p>The discussion of a plea bargain took place late last month and was offered by a high-ranking Justice Department official to the Clinton lawyer.</p> <p>During the exploratory talks with the prosecutor, the Clinton attorney was told that despite former FBI Director James Comey’s decision last July not to prosecute Hillary, the Justice Department has reexamined the email case and believes there are ample grounds for prosecuting Hillary on a number of counts.</p> <p>As part of the plea, Clinton would be forced to admit guilt:</p> <p>Under the Justice Department’s plea offer, Hillary would be required to sign a document admitting that she committed a prosecutable crime. In return, the DOJ would agree not to bring charges against Hillary in connection with the email probe.</p> <p>Also as part of the agreement, the Justice Department would not proceed with an investigation of Hillary’s pay to play deals with foreign governments and businessmen who contributed to the Clinton Foundation or who paid Bill Clinton exorbitant speaking fees.</p> Well, it’s little more than a slap on the hand but at least it requires an admission of guilt.</article>

Richard "Sam" Howard and Officer Matthew Baxter. Both of them were fathers.</p> <p>Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he was "heartbroken." President Donald Trump tweeted a message to the Kissimmee Police Department early Saturday morning.</p> <p>"My thoughts and prayers are with the Kissimmee Police and their loved ones," Trump said. "We are with you."</p> <p>Howard and Baxter, who were both wearing their uniforms, were shot about 9:30 p.m. in a neighborhood known for having drug activity, O'Dell said. Both officers were taken to Osceola Regional Hospital where doctors pronounced Baxter dead Friday night and Howard dead Saturday.</p> Everett Miller is accused of shooting at police officers Friday night in Kissimmee. <p>Four suspects were in custody early Saturday morning, O'Dell said. Detectives arrested Everett Glenn Miller, a 45-year-old military veteran with a history of mental health issues, at the Roscoe's Bar at 2344 N. Orange Blossom Trail. Police officers said he was in possession of a 9 mm and a .22 revolver.</p> <p>O'Dell said officers used Baxter's handcuffs to take Miller to the Osceola County Jail. Prosecutors charged Miller with first-degree murder, resisting arrest without violence and <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0790/Sections/0790.06.html" type="external">carrying a weapon to an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages</a>, records show.</p> <p>"I am so proud of the sworn and civilian members of our department by acting quickly to identify the suspect and bring him to justice," O'Dell said. "We will mourn over the next few days."</p> <p>Osceola County Commissioner Fred Hawkins Jr. said the last Kissimmee police officer who was killed on duty was in 1983.</p> <p>"Heartbreaking loss of two of Kissimmee's finest officers," <a href="https://twitter.com/Mayor_Jacobs/status/898748524237656064" type="external">Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs tweeted</a>.

They find the pain with the money and fame, Looking for love in all the wrong places. I see the look on their face, I think they're about to cave in. (I think they're about to cave in) I can't just stand by and wait Hoping that somehow they make it out, So here I go!</p> <p>[Chorus] I've got nothing to be ashamed of (I'm not ashamed), So why should I hide and wait for someone else to say the word? There is nothing to be afraid of (I'm not afraid), So I'll spend my life speaking what I know needs to be heard.</p> <p>[Verse 2] They hide their pain And embrace the darkness, Alone and what they're facing (what they're facing).

If I stare right into their eyes And never say a word, I gave up on who I'm to be (who I'm to be). If I don't share this love I've found, I am the one to blame.

And things got very tense very fast.</p> <p>Right off the bat, co-host Pete Hegseth asked Clarke what he thought about Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), a civil rights icon, deciding not to attend the opening because Trump would be in attendance. Clarke reacted by immediately dismissing Lewis.</p> <p>“John who?” Clarke mocking stated.</p> <p>“John Lewis — he was bloodied on the Selma bridge, Sheriff, when trying to protest voting rights and a variety of other things,” guest host Eboni Williams said in response.</p> <p>Clarke shot back that he knew who Lewis was and that he had become one of the “most irrelevant members of Congress,” adding that Lewis has been “reduced to being a caricature” before praising Trump for realizing that “actions speak louder than words.”</p> <p>“Sheriff let me say this to you,” Williams said. “For you to say that nobody cares about John Lewis is inaccurate because I assure you that there are many people across this country that absolutely do care about him.”</p> <p>She added, “As for your commentary on his political record as a congressman, I’m actually not even addressing that part because this museum opening is about the civil rights of American citizens, so when it comes to his record on that, Sheriff Clarke, I think that it’s pretty undisputed.”</p> <p>The ex-sheriff replied by saying that most people under the age of 35 don’t know who John Lewis is before bringing up that if it weren’t for Republicans, there’d be no Civil Rights Act because President Lyndon Johnson had to get GOP votes to pass it.</p> <p>“I appreciate that history lesson but as somebody that holds a degree on the subject I really don’t need you to update me on who was required for Lyndon B. Johnson to pass the Civil Rights Act,” Williams stated.</p> <p>“Apparently, you’ve forgotten some of your history,” Clarke retorted, leading Williams to smile back and tell him that she doesn’t actually have anything against Republicans. Meanwhile, Hegseth jumped back in to help Clarke out by stating he wouldn’t have even known about the museum if it wasn’t for Trump’s visit today. Of course, Clarke was completely in agreement with that comment.</p> <p>Watch the clip above, via Fox News.</p> <p>[image via screengrab]</p> <p>—</p> <p>Have a tip we should know? <a href="mailto:tips@mediaite.com" type="external">tips@mediaite.com</a></p> <p>Sponsored</p> <p>Sponsored</p></article>

President Barack Obama (right) with gymnast Simone Biles and first lady Michelle Obama. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) <p>USA's Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games teams were honored by President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday.</p> <p>“We admire your athleticism, but we also admire your character,” Obama said to the packed room. “Remember that you know when someone's watching you for the first time, and they see how hard you work, and what you accomplish, and they feel inspired. They feel like they can take any challenge on. What you do has ripples all across the country.”</p> <p>The President attributed the success of the American team to its diversity: “Everybody's from all different kinds of backgrounds, and all shapes and sizes … although all very good looking,” Obama said.</p> <p>“Imagine what it means for a young girl or a young boy who sees somebody who looks like them doing something and being the best at what they do,” he continued. “There's no kid in American who can't look at our Olympic team and see themselves somewhere. That's part of the reason why we're successful.”</p> <p>He also pointed out how the “preponderance” of U.S. women paved the way to the country's Olympic dominance in Rio, calling out gymnast Simone Biles, swimmers Simone Manuel and Katie Ledecky and cyclist Kristin Armstrong, among others. “2016 belonged to America's women Olympians,” Obama said. “Y'all crushed it.”</p> <p>The President also took time to pay tribute to track star Jesse Owens, as well as Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who raised their firsts in silent protest during the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City — because they “paved the way” for the current diverse Olympic team.</p> <p>“We're proud of them,” Obama said. “Their powerful silent protest in the 1968 Games was controversial, but it woke folks up and created greater opportunity for those that followed.”</p> <p>Here's how some Team USA members shared their day at the White House on social media.</p> <q> <p>Our Olympians and Paralympians show the world that no matter what, with perseverance, we can do incredible things.

	<article id="0000792" published-at="2017-10-18" title="The Democratic Party's obsession with Hollywood celebrities was bound to blow up | The Fresno Bee"><p>The Democratic Party’s obsession with Hollywood celebrities was bound to blow up. The party’s reliance on the entertainment industry reached a crescendo during the 2016 presidential campaign when, according to the Wrap, at least 167 Hollywood elites endorsed Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>And these were not passive endorsements. For Democrats, celebrities became a meaningful source of money, message delivery and even a tool for crowd-building at Clinton’s anemic campaign events.</p> <p>Anyway, Clinton lost and Donald Trump became president. And then came <a type="internal">Harvey Weinstein</a>, who, after having long been celebrated and enabled by the Democratic Party establishment, is now being exiled.</p> <p>But with some 30 women accusing Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, is the Weinstein scandal big enough to cause a break between the Democratic Party and the entertainment industry? The answer is no.</p> Breaking News <p>Be the first to know when big news breaks</p> <p>Recaptcha requires verification.</p> <p>protected by reCAPTCHA</p> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" type="external">Privacy</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/" type="external">Terms</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" type="external">Privacy</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/" type="external">Terms</a></p> <p>In January, I cited a useful piece written by New York Post writer and editor Maureen Callahan, “Why celebrity endorsements didn’t help Hillary at all,” and her words warrant repeating: “That those who have money, fame, privilege and status and have no cause to worry – and fail to do so – can only further divide the country and alienate those who, rightly, feel unseen, unheard and looked down upon.”</p> <p>And after Clinton lost, Callahan wrote, “those celebrities who reacted publicly often did so with a pungent brew of self-pity, condescension and didacticism.”</p> <p>Today, rather than pause and reflect, many Democrats, led by no less than Clinton, are attempting to deflect from the outcry over Weinstein and the long cover-up of his behavior by citing Trump – as if he is equally guilty. He is not.</p> <p>Clinton, who is obviously conflicted on the subject as she has a history of targeting women who have accused her husband of sexual assault and of enabling the alleged serial abuser, actually said, “Look, we just elected someone who admitted sexual assault to the presidency.”</p> <p>When I saw that comment, I was stunned to the point that I thought it might have been a spoof written by the Onion. The hypocrisy on display is stunning.</p> <p>It is a sure sign of the Democrats’ detachment that they thought being surrounded by Hollywood’s liberal stars would deliver votes. In Clinton’s case, her appeal was so narrow that she began to rely on the rich and famous to not just provide extra flare at rallies, but also to actually be the headline attraction at her campaign events while she was just making an appearance on the sidelines.</p> <p>So, what will the half-life of the Weinstein scandal’s impact be? Call me a cynic, but the Democrats will stick with Hollywood and there will be more Harvey Weinsteins. The Democrats need Hollywood and Hollywood is legendary for this behavior.</p> <p>Some Democrats knew this about Weinstein, and it is safe to say they probably know it about others today. The Democrats tolerate it because they are convinced that the star power – and the money – is worth it.</p> <p>The Democrats need the type of Hollywood show-ponies that Weinstein could control, in part because beyond criticizing Trump, Democrats really don’t have a lot to say. They have become beholden to the special interests of entertainment industry elites, trial lawyers, environmentalists and an assortment of groups with a grievance. The entertainment industry is a core part of the Democratic coalition. Period.</p> <p>Yet Democrats are quickly moving on from the Weinstein scandal. While some have superficially distanced themselves from the now-disgraced mega-donor, the fact is that Democrats are largely holding on to his money. According to Politico, the Democratic National Committee has gotten rid of only a mere 10 percent of Weinstein’s $300,000 in contributions.</p> <p>But is any of this a surprise? After all, you reap what you sow. And the Democrats’ addiction to Hollywood is permanent. They are in denial. Addicts can’t kick their habit unless they are committed to doing so.</p> <p>Ed Rogers is a contributor to the PostPartisan blog, a political consultant and a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George H.W.

	<article id="0000793" published-at="2017-03-21" title="The Story of This Man’s S*x Doll Being Stolen Is a Wild Ride From Start to Finish">
The Mystery of the Stolen Doll <p>There are some seriously strange people on the planet. Unfortunately in today’s world, they are able to broadcast themselves on different social media outlets. Before our current technological advances, we knew they were out there, but we didn’t really see them much.</p> <p>That’s all changed now and the weirdos of the world are everywhere. One man proves that when he explains the case of his missing adult doll. This story is wild and will leave you guessing until the very end. Check out the story.</p> <p>Source: Instagram @b.l.o.themovie</p> The Mystery of the Stolen Doll <p>The journey begins when one man posts a picture of his new friend. He claims he did not purchase the doll, but that instead she was given to him. I feel it’s important to mention that this man has a terrifying YouTube channel and I believe he is under the impression that he has fans. He seems be saying that the doll was given to him from an unknown fan.</p> <p>It’s definitely a strange thing to post to Facebook.</p> <p>Then, the unthinkable happens! Oh no, she has been stolen!</p> <p>It would seem that an intruder had broken into this famous young man’s home and the only thing they took was his beloved doll.</p> <p>He is alone and sad but luckily the police will keep him informed if they discover any information regarding this horrible crime.</p> <p>Good news, the doll has been found! Bad news, she has been chopped to bits by a crazy meth addict/cook who was pulled over for a measly traffic violation!</p> <p>Coincidentally, this perpetrator will be locked away for life due to the amount of meth discovered in his car!</p> <p>Our guy is still very sad. “Gess” he don’t deserve “happyness.”</p> The Mystery of the Stolen Doll <p>Now, for the truly unexpected ending.</p> <p>This man (who is pictured above displaying his confidence) reveals that he, in fact was lying. He was eaten up with the guilt of his lie that he felt the only solution was for him to come clean. Do not forget, all of this he decided was appropriate to share on Facebook.</p> <p>He revealed that he was actually “using” the doll when a terrible thing happened.</p> <p>He must have been pounding away a bit too violently when her lady parts ripped in half. Thank god this man is using an object instead of a woman because he got so mad at the doll that he chopped it to pieces and threw it away.</p> <p>Don’t worry— he apologized to his friends and fans for lying. He left us with this, “I was embarresed and Im sorry for lieing to friends and fans.”</p> <p>Well, at least he apologized. Sound off in the comments and SHARE this creepy story!</p></article>

	<article id="0000795" published-at="2017-01-03" title="Is feminism and women misandry for men just women showing their true faces for men?"><p>Now throughout history women have always had a need for men to provide, give protection for them, strength, ingenuity, get food for them, and help build society up for them. Many feminist like to argue that the lack of female inventors was due to male oppression but the thing is when human existence was young, there was no social structure or patriarch put in place and women had the same equal opportunity as men to come to the discovery of tools/make fire. Hell, a social experiment was done on survivors where men and women were serrated into 2 teams and men worked together to improve their living situation while women were left clueless and passively content with the way things are.</p> <p>So the driving force for our society progression has been men in term of technological advances and males were still valued and needed and women because of this were submissive, showed respect and were kind to men.</p> <p>Thanks to technological advances male physical strength is no longer needed as much by society, nor is male protection; a gun beats a big hulking man. Also seeing from the Western bubble we live in, many Western women will never experience the harsh effect of war or need a man to defend her against invaders which has only resulted in them no longer needing men as much. Thus, we see that in many aspect male duties that women once needed are no longer necessarily needed and this coincides right around the time in which feminism showed up.</p> <p>With feminism women seem to have now showed their true face and feeling for men it seems and have varying levels of misandry for men. It is like a fake ass friend who is nice to you because they need you but once you are no longer needed reveal what they truly think about you.</p> <p>Updates:</p> <p>By the way for those saying i hate women, this is not about hate but just me making a question based on observation. Feminism came around the time, society was stabilised with plenty food/water/shelter, there was no war or need for physical strength and basically where many of the usefulness women had for men became ended up becoming less and less important. This question is just asking based on this coincidence.</p> <p>Nah, lol, but misogyny is obviously poisoning brains of some weak and pathetic men who ignore the difference between feminism and feminazism:</p> <a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/files/2014/10/feminist-feminazi1-500x433.jpg" type="external"/> <p/> <p>As for the remark about communism and trump, I never mentioned either so I don't understand what your trying to say. If what I stated, if the organizations (which you neglected to address) and the protestors who are comprised of feminist (again you neglected to adress) if the intellectuals and the ones creating the philosophy and teaching it (which again you neglected to adress) are not actual feminist then what is a feminist and why would we call such a minority group within this particular group that has apparently completely different ideals and philosophies, feminist? What is a feminist then if not what I have presented?</p> <p>@hellionthesagereborn I never asked for your opinion, I said I don't care what you think, I know what kind of idiots invented so-called "straw argument", that bullshit is used just because they don't know what else to say as a reply to an argument they can't win, so they promote they "fallacy" idiotism (calling it "logic"), pretending to be "smart" by driveling Latin phrases, desperately trying to degrade other people with their egotism and annoying objections, but guess what, they always fail, or they get their asses kicked. Luckily for them, they are just "internet warriors", but in real life, they don't dare to face another person, they live like outcasts, in their parent's basements.Feminazi writers are not Feminists, I can say that I'm "Alien", or "Doctor", or "Angel" - but I'm not, Feminazis are just pretenders, not true Feminists.You can keep on living in your world of illusions, quasi-philosophy, and pseudo-intellectualism, but you'll never find a girlfriend that way</p> <p>No whats happening is feminist and liberals have been conditioning women to hate men, its not inherint otherwise things would be much worse (look at the propaganda against men and then see that most women despite treating men poorly do not treat them nearly as bad as you would expect with how much they are represented as monsters). Its basically the same thing that happens to a spoiled child. When you don't hold them to a standard, when you don't punish them for wrong doing, when you tell them they are above every one else from birth and then have both parents and schools and society stating the exact same things, how women are now is inevitable. Men would turn out the same way too except no one would ever put men on a pedestal to the detriment of women, we are biologically as well as socially inclined to revere women and view men as disposable.</p></article>

It has been two years since the couple announced their separation last 2015.</p> <p>Some reports are telling that Ben Affleck is considering his self as a new man after he moved out from their home and from his children with Jennifer Garner. After announcing their separation last 2015, it has been reported already that the two were living in separate rooms and now the actor just left their home as per <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2017/04/17/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-dating-moving-prenup-divorce/" type="external">TMZ</a>.</p> <p>Reports were claiming that Ben Affleck has been looking forward to his new life as a bachelor and is ready to date again.

FBI Director James Comey <p>WASHINGTON ― Whether or not FBI Director <a type="internal">James Comey</a> wanted to upset next week’s election by revealing the bureau is again looking at <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> emails, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is trying to leverage that news to buttress its dwindling chances of keeping the Senate.</p> <p>According to HuffPost Pollster’s detailed poll modeling, the Republicans’ chances of maintaining a majority in the upper chamber are down to <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2016/forecast/senate" type="external">17 percent</a> ― a precipitous fall from <a type="internal">a couple of weeks</a> ago when they had about a 60 percent shot at holding on.</p> <p>That fall has continued since Comey’s October surprise, but the NRSC is pretty sure the <a type="internal">oft-discussed</a> and <a type="internal">investigated</a> <a type="internal">Clinton emails</a> will reinvigorate their chances.</p> <p>To that end, the committee dropped a new ad Tuesday aimed primarily at the web that tries to use the new news to motivate voters whose distaste for GOP presidential nominee <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> might have clouded their memories about how little they like his Democratic rival.</p> <p>“It’s time to start asking why are Democrat Senate candidates still standing with Hillary Clinton?” the spot states. A montage then runs that includes Clinton meeting with Arab leaders, a smashed computer, and 1984-like footage that appears lifted from an old ad supporting President <a type="internal">Barack Obama</a> in 2008.</p> <p>“They already know about the smashed private email servers, sketchy meetings, shady political donations, special immunity deals,” the commercial continues.</p> <p>“Now Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation… again,” it says, before noting that a pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, is backing the Democrats. (The ad is called “Priorities H.R.C.”)</p> <p>“If these Democrat Senate candidates are letting her get away with these scandals now, just imagine what they would let Hillary Clinton get away in the White House, the spot concludes.</p> <p>The FBI has still not suggested its latest review of the former secretary of state will change its earlier decision that she broke no laws, and there’s little evidence that Comey’s announcement has moved voters. But the NRSC at least thinks Comey’s move could help the GOP.</p> <p>“Democrat Senate candidates across the country must now spend the last week of the campaign explaining to voters why they are so eager to vouch for Hillary Clinton’s honesty and trustworthiness,” said NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek.</p> <p>Watch the spot below.</p> <p>If the GOP’s new ad didn’t make clear how Republicans feel about Comey’s decision to raise the issue of Clinton’s email near the end of the election, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told supporters over the weekend that Comey’s letter to Congress Friday was a gift.</p> <p>In audio obtained by CNN, Burr was frank in describing how tough it would be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/richard-burr-hillary-clinton-gun-owners/" type="external">to get his own voters out to the polls</a>.</p> <p>“I know that people are on the fence. Some of them are Republicans. We got to get ‘em off the fence, folks. We gotta get them to the point where they say, ‘I’m gonna do it,’” Burr told supporters in an eastern North Carolina gun shop.</p> <p>“And we were given a gift yesterday,” said Burr, who is locked in a tough re-election fight with former Democratic state Rep. Deborah Ross. “I walked into a rally in Smithfield, and I said, ‘Let me show you what I got today,’ and I pulled out of my pocket my letter from Jim Comey, opening up the investigation again.”</p> <p>This post has been updated with comments made by Sen.

	<article id="0000804" published-at="2016-11-01" title="Paul Manafort Insists He’s Clean, Nothing To See Here, Folks"><p>WASHINGTON – When last we saw Paul Manafort, international consigliere and erstwhile chairman of the <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> campaign, he was heading out the door and into radio silence.</p> <p>His six-month campaign stint ended in August after he lost clout with the boss and following a wave of stories about his lucrative role as a consultant to and lobbyist for a pro-Russia Ukrainian leader.</p> <p>But Manafort resurfaced on Tuesday to deny to HuffPost that he was under investigation for alleged ties to Russia, its hackers or its president, Vladimir Putin. Or for anything else.</p> <p>Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, have complained that FBI Director James Comey – so willing to besmirch <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> by revealing the bureau’s interest in Huma Abedin’s emails – was unwilling to discuss an FBI investigation into Trump’s ties to Putin. Part of that probe allegedly focused on Manafort’s work in Eastern Europe.</p> <p>In fact, the FBI has found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html" type="external">no direct link between Trump and Russia</a>, at least thus far, according to The New York Times. Comey’s reluctance to discuss the status of such a probe could well be because there’s nothing to reveal.</p> <p>“There is no story,” Manafort insisted to me. “This is just Harry Reid and Clinton deflection.”</p> <p>Comey, for his part, has not commented.</p> <p>NBC News reported Monday that Manafort was <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-making-inquiry-ex-trump-campaign-manager-s-foreign-ties-n675881" type="external">the subject of an “inquiry”</a> into his foreign business activities – an assertion that he hotly denies.</p> <p>“The NBC story is an outrageous smear,” Manafort said to me. “There is nothing of my business activities to investigate. There is no FBI investigation and even NBC admitted that there is no criminal investigation.”</p> <p>“This is presidential politics and nothing more,” he added.</p> <p>As Manafort’s own carefully worded denial suggests, there could, at some point, be an inquiry into his work, perhaps into whether he registered as a “foreign agent” for Ukraine in the U.S. or whether he inappropriately funneled money from Ukraine into lobbying efforts.</p> <p>But those evidently would be topics for another, lower-temperature time.</p> <p>“There is NO activity,” Manafort said.</p> <p>In the meantime, his old boss (they evidently haven’t spoken much, if at all, since August) could become president of the United States.</p> <p>“I think it is now even money” that Trump will win, Manafort said. “It’s moving like Reagan-Carter in 1980.”</p> <p>HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

The Indiana Voter Registration Program boasts that it was able to sign up 40,000 new voters in the state ― many of them African-American ― until Republican leaders stepped in to claim voter fraud. Now State Police Superintendent Doug Carter is investigating an “unusually high number of date of birth and first name changes” among the new voters.

	<article id="0000806" published-at="2016-09-24" title="The Oppression and Mass Execution of African-American Men will Cripple America">
Black Men in Ferguson (Hands Up, Don’t shoot) <p>The not guilty verdict and acquittal of all charges against George Zimmerman in the case of Trayvon Martin, the decision to not indict Cleveland Police Officers-Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback for the murder and the cover up shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, and the failure to indict ex-police officer Darren Wilson in the case of Mike Brown, along with other similar cases, have angered many people, largely because most people still feel that “justice” was not served in these cases.</p> <p>Many believe these cases exhibit the state-sanctioned killings of young African-American men. In many ways, those who are offset by the murders are right. What we can all agree on is that the facts overwhelmingly show that all the mentioned cases are tragedies, without question! Many believe that race played a role in most, if not all, of these judgments. So, what does this demonstrate about our country’s ability ― or lack thereof ― to provide justice for all and protect it’s citizens? Let’s discuss these questions.</p> <p>Let’s be honest, circumstantially most Black people believe they just don’t have the privileges or immunities of citizenship or due process ― of life, liberty or even equal protection of laws granted to other citizens (they are right in many ways). Within the African-American community, most, when asked, will say that they have never stopped being marginalized, criminalized and convicted for their skin color, beginning during slavery, and lasting into the economic and psychological era of slavery that we now call the new Jim Crow.</p> <p>Strangely enough, there is a similarity between all these cases, but there are some lingering questions we must ask ourselves. We could ask, “Why would any police routinely be allowed take the life of citizens, time after time, and not abide by their public mandate, which is to ‘serve and protect?’” Today, we have questionable cases like Alton Sterling and others. The police murders keep stocking up, and for the most part, the only change around the country is that we are seeing more tragic cases of police murder everyday.</p> <p>As a nation, did we fail?</p> <p>Ultimately, some of these more disturbing questions will be answered by police internal affairs investigators, government officials and civic leaders. Other questions — the deeper, subliminal ones that ask about equality and intolerance — must be answered within our classrooms and our courtrooms. These deeper questions have now gone out from our living rooms and onto our televisions in our homes. Their very existence attests that we, as a black nation, have failed our Trayvon Martins, Mike Browns and our Tamir Rices, as well as all young black men.</p> <p>Before his highly controversial death at the hands of a white police officer, Michael Brown had graduated from Normandy High School – a school whose academic standards and finances were so poor that it had been declared “unaccredited” by Missouri state education authorities.</p> <p>During the 2011-2012 school year, 829 young black men and women were meted out one out-of-school suspension by Ferguson-Florissant.</p> That’s 8.1 percent of the 10,197 black children attending the district’s schools, according to data submitted to the U.S. Department of Education. A recent <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf" type="external">study</a> by the Office for Civil Rights shows that the percentage of young black men suspended from school (as Trayvon Martin was) is far greater than that of their peers of other nationalities. <p>However, Chief Charles Hurley of the Miami-Dade School Police Department (MDSPD) had implemented a policy in 2010 that reduced the number of criminal reports, manipulating statistics to create the appearance of a reduction in crime within the school system.</p> <p>Less than two weeks before Martin’s death, the school system <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2013/05/01/m-dspd-cover-up-the-curious-case-of-trayvon-martins-backpack-with-stolen-jewelry-and-burglary-tool/" type="external">commended Chief Hurley for “decreasing school-related juvenile delinquency by an impressive 60 percent for the last six months of 2011.”</a></p> <p>Another <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/rd_crisisoftheyoung.pdf" type="external">study</a>, by The Sentencing Project, examines vastly disproportionate rates of incarceration for African-American Men. We should be asking ourselves, “Why do these disparities exist?”</p> <p>Deep rooted victim complexes.</p> <p>Please Note: Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown both were not just victims of their seemingly racist killers alone. They all are victims of the lopsided school systems that failed them. They are victims of a police force that overwhelmingly assumes first that most young black men are criminals, thugs and near animals ― followed by an outright fear of them.</p> <p>They are a victims of bad legislation, like the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0776/Sections/0776.013.html" type="external">Florida’s Stand Your Ground law</a>, that gives anyone who wills the unfettered right to kill blacks and others if they feel threatened in any way.</p> <p>They are victims of a certain moral blindness – which means every single black person, in the eyes of a racist, symbolizes a terrible crime from their ugly past, a reminder that their life is a fraud. These racists need to simply own up to their ugly past of slavery and make it right by society, instead of denying, shifting blame, lying, twisting the facts and making black people into these ungodly creatures that they look down on, laugh at and yet, oddly, fear.</p> <p>This is a failed attempt to be at “peace,” with themselves. This must stop.</p> <p>The truth will eventually surface.</p> <p>We need more love in our communities! We need to love and accept our children unconditionally. Regardless of our child’s age, we have to instill feelings of acceptance and self-worth. Teach children, by how you treat them, that they are valuable and worthy of love. It doesn’t matter if you don’t agree with every choice or interest of your child.Tomorrow, look around your community, your home. Do you have any Trayvon Martins? As an educator, you have the power to stave off feelings of emptiness after another young Mike Brown’s death. Talk to your children about racism ― tell them that Tamir Rice was just an innocent child whose death was motivated by racism.</p> <p>Question any legislation that endorses police vigilantism. <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/prosecute-the-killer-of-our-son-17-year-old-trayvon-martin" type="external">Speak up against police inaction</a>. Then, tell your child that he is protected, first by God, and then you. Afterward, we must champion our children’s rights. Then add a training session to the life lesson for your young men and women about the existence of systematic racism and oppression ― be honest with them, tell them the odds are against them, but they can overcome if they have righteous will and fortitude.</p> <p>Nothing will fully fill the void created in the lost lives of Tamir, Trayvon and Mike for family, friends and teachers. But Tamir, Trayvon and Mike’s empty desks must become symbols of awareness and change — a sign to our society that the current state of affairs is not acceptable, and we won’t let racists, or anyone else, destroy us and our future without a fight!</p> <p>Gregg L.

I don’t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have four million American citizen children.”</p> <p>Trump, for his part, initially seemed to confirm that he wanted to focus on deportation, saying that Mexican drug lords had to be rounded up, which has been a core theme of his campaign.</p> <p>“We have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out,” Trump said.</p> <p>But he glossed over his plans to deport as many other undocumented immigrants as possible. He also veered between arguing Clinton wants amnesty and an open border and insisting she wanted a wall along the southwest border and tying her to President Barack Obama’s deportation numbers. He was referring to Clinton’s vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which mandated the creation of hundreds of miles of border fencing that is still unfinished. Trump has said his border wall would be different from the fencing that currently exists ― in suggesting Clinton’s position was the same as his, he was really just arguing against his own claims that she opposes border security.</p> <p>“Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts,” he said. “Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn’t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.”</p> <p>Each of the candidates brought guests to call out while they discussed immigration. Trump invited four people whose family members were killed by undocumented immigrants, while Clinton called out 11-year-old <a type="internal">Karla Ortiz</a>, a U.S. citizen whose parents are undocumented.</p> <p>Immigration is a huge issue in Nevada ― undocumented immigrants make up 7 percent of the state’s population, a higher share than any other state, according to the most recent estimates from <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/09/20/overall-number-of-u-s-unauthorized-immigrants-holds-steady-since-2009/" type="external">Pew Research Center</a>.</p> <p>The fates of those undocumented immigrants and their families would be vastly different under Trump or Clinton.</p> <p>Trump <a href="http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/" type="external">launched his campaign</a> by vowing to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico ― that Mexico would pay for ― to prevent what he painted as a scourge of criminals crossing the border without authorization. He <a type="internal">repeatedly promised</a> over the ensuing year that all undocumented immigrants would have to leave the country should he become president, although some might be able to return legally. In August, Trump encouraged speculation that he was reconsidering his hardline stance on deportations, before <a type="internal">confirming in early September</a> that he would ramp up enforcement and attempt to drive out other undocumented immigrants by making it harder for them to live in the country.</p> <p>Clinton supports legislation to grant legal status to many of the undocumented immigrants with longstanding ties to the country, and eventually allow them to gain citizenship. In the meantime, she <a type="internal">has said she would</a> use her executive powers to protect some from deportation ― going beyond what President Barack Obama attempted. She also made a spate of other immigration reform promises, such as shutting down private detention centers and expanding access to lawyers for people in deportation proceedings.</p> <p>Immigration isn’t typically the top issue for Latino voters, but does rank higher among them than the overall population. And Trump appears poised for a bigger loss with Latino voters than failed 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who infamously called for undocumented immigrants to “self-deport” and then <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/11/07/latino-voters-in-the-2012-election/" type="external">received only 27 percent</a> of the Latino vote.</p> <p>Latino voters heavily favor Clinton to Trump: An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/poll-clinton-maintains-50-point-lead-among-latinos-n667326" type="external">released this week</a> found that 70 percent would choose Clinton and 17 percent would choose Trump in a head-to-head matchup.</p> <p>Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost%0A.com/entry/donald-trump-violence_us_56e1f16fe4b0b25c91815913" type="external">incites political violence</a> and is a <a type="internal">serial liar</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost%0A.com/entry/9-outrageous-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-latinos_55e483a1e4b0c818f618904b" type="external">rampant xenophobe</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost%0A.com/entry/donald-trump-racist-examples_us_56d47177e4b03260bf777e83" type="external">racist</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost%0A.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023" type="external">misogynist</a> and <a type="internal">birther</a> who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.</p></article>

Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks in support of Donald Trump during a Trump campaign rally <p>The controversial sheriff who <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a>pardoned has announced he is running for the US Senate to help "Make America Great Again".</p> <p>Former Maricopa County Sheriff <a type="internal">Joe Arpaio</a> – who the Justice Department claims oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling by a law enforcement agency in US history – said he will run for the Senate in Arizona next year.</p> <p>"I am running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Arizona, for one unwavering reason: to support the agenda and policies of President Donald Trump in his mission to Make America Great Again," Mr Arpaio tweeted on Tuesday.</p> <a type="internal">Read more</a> <p>The announcement puts him in the middle of a crowded Republican primary race to replace current Arizona Senator <a type="internal">Jeff Flake</a> – a frequent critic of Mr Trump. US Representative Martha McSally and former state Senator Kelli Ward are both vying for the seat.</p> <p>Mr Arpaio told the Washington Examiner that he planned to "work hard" and not "take anything for granted" in the race.</p> <p>"But I would not being doing this if I thought that I could not win," he added. "I’m not here to get my name in the paper, I get that everyday, anyway.”</p> <p>Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called the announcement "sad and disturbing," and said his party would fight "tooth and nail" to prevent Mr Arpaio from holding office.</p> <p>Mr Arpaio was Mr Trump's first pardon, and one of his first supporters. He was convicted of criminal contempt of court last year for defying an order to stop officers from detaining people based solely on suspicion of their immigration status.</p> <p>The former sheriff's strict stance on <a type="internal">immigration</a> helped catapult him to national fame, and into the President's good graces. During his six terms in office, Mr Arpaio led a department with “a pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos,” according to the Justice Department.</p> <p>Under Mr Arpaio's tenure, Latino drivers were unfairly targeted for traffic stops, and Spanish-speaking prisoners were punished for failing to understand officer's orders in English. Inmates were occasionally forced to wear pink underwear and sleep in sweltering "tent cities" as punishment.</p> <p>Mr Trump called the sheriff a "great American patriot" and claimed he had "done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration," in an interview with Fox News in August.</p> <p>"Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?" he wondered at a campaign rally later that month.</p> <p>The President's decision to pardon Mr Arpaio was condemned by many on the left and right – including Arizona's two Republican Senators, Mr Flake and <a type="internal">John McCain</a>. Mr Arpaio dismissed the Senators' comments on Tuesday, telling NBC News: "I don't have to talk to them."</p> <p>The 85-year-old also played off concerns about his age, saying he only planned to serve one term.</p> <p>"I’ll gun anybody," he told NBC. "What’s the age got to do with it?"</p> <p>Mr Trump has yet to endorse in the race.</p></article>

"It was something that was just intolerable in every way. And, you know, like so many people who've come forward and spoken out, this was a different side of a person who I and many others had known in the past."</p> <p>The politician, who has received campaign donations from Weinstein in the past, continued her condemnation. "People in Democratic politics for a couple of decades appreciated his help and support," she said. "And I think these stories coming to light now—and people who never spoke out before having the courage to speak out—just clearly demonstrates that this behavior that he engaged in cannot be tolerated."</p> <p>While Clinton says that she cannot return the Miramax co-founder's past monetary contributions, she hopes to channel his donations toward charity.</p> <p>"What other people are saying, what my former colleagues are saying, is they're going to donate it to charity, and of course I will do that," she concluded. "I give 10 percent of my income to charity every year, this will be part of that. There's no—there's no doubt about it."</p></article>

	<article id="0000817" published-at="2016-10-13" title="Liberty U. Students: ‘Donald Trump &amp; Jerry Falwell Jr. Don’t Represent Us’"><p>Liberty University students want to be free — of their president’s surrogacy for Donald Trump. On Wednesday, a group of students calling themselves “ <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdLe5fbVw0d12MtiYcJCf-hLDjpr7AdiYTIkMBttqdLuTQbg/viewform" type="external">Liberty United Against Trump</a>” released a letter dissociating themselves from the Republican nominee and his chief Evangelical surrogate:</p> <q> <p>In the months since Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed him, Donald Trump has been inexorably associated with Liberty University. We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell’s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.</p> <p>A majority of Liberty students, faculty, and staff feel as we do. Donald Trump received a pitiful 90 votes from Liberty students in Virginia’s primary election, a colossal rejection of his campaign. Nevertheless, President Falwell eagerly uses his national platform to advocate for Donald Trump. While he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials.</p> <p>Associating any politician with Christianity is damaging to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But Donald Trump is not just any politician. He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.</p> </q> <p>The slow-motion suicide of the Religious Right — which has been very publicly conducted over the course of this election cycle — is, among much else, a product of distinctly generational loyalties. It’s no coincidence that most of the Evangelical leaders who have bent the knee to Trump are Baby Boomers: <a type="internal">As Yuval Levin has argued</a>, it’s a whole generation, on both Right and Left, for whom nostalgia is the overarching mood. For Christians who came of age during the years of the Moral Majority, that entails a yearning to figure out how to restore the cultural consensus of postwar Christian America — a yearning that ignores that such an America only ever half-existed, at best, and that has led many to reduce the high duties of faith to the mechanics of national politics.</p> <p>But a much more confident faith is on display among younger Evangelical leaders — Russell Moore, for example, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics &amp;amp; Religious Liberty Convention. These Liberty students are another example. Here’s how they end their statement:</p> <q> <p>We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. While our president Jerry Falwell Jr. tours the country championing the log in his eye, we want the world to know how many students oppose him. We don’t want to champion Donald Trump; we want only to be champions for Christ.</p> </q> <p>Amen.</p> <p>Take a moment to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdLe5fbVw0d12MtiYcJCf-hLDjpr7AdiYTIkMBttqdLuTQbg/viewform" type="external">read the statement in full</a>.</p> <a type="internal"/> <a type="internal"/> <a type="internal"/> <a type="internal"/> <a type="internal"/></article>
	<article id="0000818" published-at="2017-12-08" title="How Democrats Corrupt English to Create Hysteria">
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer discuss the GOP tax-reform bill on Capitol Hill in November. (Reuters photo: Joshua Roberts) <p>Whenever passable Republican legislation materializes — a rarity these days — Democrats quickly warn that thousands, or perhaps even millions, of lives are at stake. Tax reform? Health care? Bogus international treaties? Internet regulations that were instituted only last year? It really doesn’t matter. Longstanding conservative ideas are not only wrong; they portend the end of America as we know it.</p> <p>Why are liberals so apocalyptic and bellicose about tax reform (a rare cut that is, according to the sometimes-reliable Washington Post fact-checkers, only the eighth largest in history)? Well, everyone in politics tends to dramatize the consequences of policy for effect. A modern Democratic party drifting toward Bernie-ism, though, is far more likely to legitimately perceive any cuts in taxation as a limiting of state control, and thus an attack on all decency and morality. Taxation, after all, is the finest tool of redistribution. So it’s understandable.</p> <p>But that’s not all of it. With failure comes frustration, and with frustration there is a need to ratchet up the panic-stricken rhetoric. It’s no longer enough to hang nefarious personal motivations on your political opponents — although it certainly can’t hurt! Good political activists must now corrupt language and ideas to imbue their ham-fisted arguments with some kind of basic plausibility. Many liberal columnists, for example, will earnestly argue that Republicans — who at this moment control the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the White House, thanks to our free and fair elections — are acting undemocratically when passing bills. As you know, democracy means raising taxes on the minority. What else could it mean?</p> <p>But the most obvious and ubiquitous of the Left’s contorted contentions about the tax bill deliberately muddles the concept of giving and the concept of taking. This distortion is so embedded in contemporary political rhetoric that I’m not sure most of the progressive foot soldiers even think it’s odd to say anymore.</p> <p>“You really shouldn’t lower everyone’s taxes, because it creates deficits and makes it harder to expand important programs like Medicaid” doesn’t have quite the same jolt as “You’re killing the poor!” And yet, whatever you make of the separate tax bills in the House and Senate, the authors are not taking one penny from anyone (unless you consider debt a tax on future generations, which doesn’t seem to be the case for either party). In fact, no spending is being cut (unfortunately). Not one welfare program is being given a block grant. Not one person is losing a subsidy. It’s just a traditional wide-ranging tax cut without any concurrent spending cuts.</p> <p>To believe that taxing at a moderately lower rate is the same as “taking” from the poor, you must believe the following: Some arbitrary rates concocted by politicians many years ago for corporations, child credits, or deductions are now baselines that all future generations must hold sacred and/or the state has a natural right to your property, and whatever you keep is stolen from the collective.</p> <p>Or, of course, you might just be extraordinarily dishonest. Because it’s perfectly legitimate and comprehensible to stake a position that argues that government has a duty to create a fairer nation by redistributing money from the well-off to the less fortunate.</p> <p>Our progressive federal tax code already places most of the tax burden on the wealthy, but perhaps you believe they should pay more. I get it; you’re worried about income inequality. On the other hand, it is preposterous to claim — as many journalists have — that lowering rates across the board is a state-sponsored “transfer” of wealth. And no amount of pseudoscientific explainer charts will alter reality.</p> <q> <p>These perversions of basic language aren’t new, but they are becoming more prevalent.</p> </q> <p>For that matter, overturning the Obamacare mandate to purchase health insurance — a market coercion masquerading, for purely legal purposes, as a tax — does not mean that any Americans will have lost “access” to health-care insurance, as the vast majority of liberal pundits claim. That the Left deliberately confuses consumer choice with a lack of availability says something about its growing authoritarian inclinations. These perversions of basic language aren’t new, but they are becoming more prevalent. Democrats routinely refer to legal actions they disapprove of as “loopholes” and claim that conservatives are trying to “ban” contraception because they don’t want buying it to be a collective responsibility. These aren’t typical political euphemisms; these are a corrosion of language that we shouldn’t allow to be normalized.</p> <p>READ MORE:</p> <a type="internal">David Harsanyi</a> — David Harsanyi is a senior editor of the Federalist and the author of First Freedom: A Ride through America’s Enduring History with the Gun, From the Revolution to Today. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/davidharsanyi" type="external">@davidharsanyi</a> <a type="internal">Photo Essays</a></article>
	<article id="0000819" published-at="2016-08-18" title="The Ryan Lochte story just keeps getting weirder">
Lochte wasn’t entirely truthful. Source:AP <p>AMERICAN swimmer Ryan Lochte has changed elements of a story claiming he and fellow teammates were robbed at gunpoint by thieves impersonating police in Rio.</p> <p>The 32-year initially claimed he was in a taxi with several members of the US swim team before they were pulled over, forced to the ground and had their wallets stolen. When he initially refused to lay down, Lochte said one of the robbers cocked a gun and put it against his head.</p> <p>However, he has since changed tack slightly, reportedly telling NBC’s Matt Lauer they weren’t in fact pulled over, and he did not have a gun put to his head.</p> <p>Instead, he said the swimmers had a gun pointed in their direction when they emerged from a petrol station rest room and tried to get into a taxi, only for the driver to prevent them from getting in.</p> <p>He then claimed the driver refused to move before two men approached the car and told them to get on the ground. He stuck to his story about refusing to lay down while his teammates obliged, saying: “I have no reason to get on the ground.</p> <p>“We wouldn’t make a story up. We’re victims in this,” Lochte reportedly told Lauer.</p> <q> <p>Matt Lauer on NBC says Ryan Lochte changed his story in call today. No longer says gun was put to his head, nor that they were pulled over</p>— Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonswaine/status/766095593055850497" type="external">August 18, 2016</a> </q> <q> <p>Lauer: Lochte now says they were ambushed after using gas stn restroom when cab driver refused to drive, gun was "pointed in his direction"</p>— Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonswaine/status/766096827850588160" type="external">August 18, 2016</a> </q> <p>As if the story couldn’t get more confusing, American sportscaster Bob Costas later interviewed Lauer about his interview with Lochte.</p> <p>Lauer said the swimmer had altered parts of his story, but the guts of it remained true.</p> <p>“He did (tweak his story),” Lauer said. “He stuck to most of the story. He did change one thing. I would say he softened some things, or stepped back.</p> <p>“One thing he did not say this time — he didn’t say he was pulled over by these people pretending to be police.”</p> <p>Lauer then told Costas why Lochte may have changed details about having a gun cocked to his head.</p> <p>“I think he feels it was more of a traumatic mischaracterisation. I think people listening at home might think that it was an embellishment at the time, but that is up for people to decide.”</p> <p>Earlier, Lochte had told NBC’s Billy Bush the robbers pulled out police badges when approaching him.</p> Lochte re-telling his story. Source:Twitter <p>“I was with a couple of swimmers. We were coming back from a friend’s house. We got pulled over in our taxi. These guys came out with a badge, a police badge. No lights. No nothing. Just a police badge.</p> <p>“They pulled us over. They pulled out their guns.”</p> <p>Lochte’s story was called into question when footage emerged of the swimmers appearing to re-enter the Olympic Village with their wallets.</p> <p>Yesterday a Rio judge ordered Lochte, Gunna Betz and Jack Conger’s passports be seized so they could be brought in for further questioning, suggesting there were doubts about the veracity of their claims.</p> <p>Lochte, though, had already flown home to the US, but as reported by <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/olympics-2016/brazilian-judge-orders-seizing-of-ryan-lochtes-passport-and-casts-doubt-over-claims-of-robbery-in-rio/news-story/5d051b01a84a39fe813dda39667a1d66" type="external">The Daily Telegraph</a>, Betz and Conger were detained at Rio airport on their way home.

"From there on ... people just started dropping like flies."</p> <p>Alexandria Cheplak, 25, called her father as she ran from the bullets.</p> <p>"Everyone's dying around me," Jon Cheplak recalled her saying. "Everyone's dying. They shot my friend ... I've got to get out of here."</p> <p>The gunman, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, unleashed a hail of bullets from the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Monday.</p> <p>But why the massacre happened remains a mystery.</p> <p>"I can't get into the mind of a psychopath," the sheriff said. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman described the gunman as "a crazed lunatic full of hate."</p> <p>Latest developments</p> <p>-- Police had no prior knowledge of the gunman before the attack, Sheriff Lombardo said. "I don't know how it could have been prevented," he said.</p> <p>-- Paddock bought multiple firearms in the past, but investigators believe the firearms were purchased legally, a law enforcement official said. The official said initial reports suggest at least one rifle was altered to function as an automatic weapon.</p> <p>-- Police found 23 rifles inside Paddock's hotel room, Las Vegas police said.</p> <p>-- 19 additional firearms were recovered from Paddock's home in Mesquite, Nevada. Law enforcement also found explosives, 1,000s of rounds of ammunition and electronic devices.</p> <p>-- Law enforcement executed a search on Paddock's second home in northern Nevada, Lombardo said.</p> <p>Festival turns into massacre</p> <p>The massacre started around 10:08 p.m. Sunday (1:08 a.m. ET Monday) at the <a href="http://rt91harvest.com/" type="external">Route 91 Harvest festival</a>, Lombardo said.</p> <p>Benge was enjoying the concert with his sister when he heard a relentless onslaught of "200 to 300" bullets.</p> <p>"The firing went on forever," witness Kimberly Chilcote said.</p> <p>She and her husband ran in short bursts -- sprinting and hiding to avoid being targeted.</p> <p>"There were purses and shoes everywhere ... there were bodies and blood," she said. "We just kept running."</p> <p>Benge lauded the heroics of his sister, who "threw herself on top of me and said, 'I love you, Taylor,'" he said.</p> <p>"Even after an hour and 30 minutes, I didn't know if I was safe."</p> <p>Witness Bryan Hopkins said he survived by jumping into a walk-in freezer at the Mandalay Bay hotel.</p> <p>And country singer Jake Owen, who was on stage with Aldean, said children were among the crowd.</p> <p>"I saw kids on their parents' shoulders tonight," he said. "This is something they'll never forget."</p> <p>The investigation</p> <p>Police said they believe Paddock acted alone. "Right now, we believe it's a sole actor, a lone-wolf-type actor," the sheriff said.</p> <p>So far, the massacre has no known link to overseas terrorism or terror groups, a US official with knowledge of the case said.</p> <p>And a woman who was described as a "person of interest" after the attack is now not believed to be involved in the shooting, police said in a statement.</p> <p>"Marilou Danley is no longer being sought out as a person of interest," the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. "LVMPD detectives have made contact with her and do not believe she is involved with the shooting on the strip."</p> <p>The gunman's brother, Eric Paddock, said he was stunned to learn Stephen was responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.</p> <p>"We're still just completely befuddled. Dumbstruck," Eric Paddock said outside his home in Orlando, Florida.</p> <p>He described his brother, a retired accountant, as "a wealthy guy. He liked to play video poker. He went on cruises."</p> <p>The last time Eric Paddock spoke to his brother was when Stephen texted him, asking how their mother was doing after losing power from Hurricane Irma.</p> <p>Eric Paddock said he knew his brother owned a few handguns and maybe one long rifle, but said he did not know of any automatic weapons.</p> <p>Blood donations needed</p> <p>With hundreds of victims still hospitalized, officials feared the death toll will keep rising.</p> <p>The sheriff implored the community to donate blood. And before dawn Monday, throngs of donors had already lined up outside a blood bank.</p> <p>Shanda Maloney tweeted a photo while she stood in line at 4:30 a.m.</p> <p>"This. Is. Vegas. This is our community. These are our people. Thank you to everyone here donating," she tweeted.</p> <p>Maloney told CNN she also gave transportation to anyone who needed it after the attack.</p> <p>"I just started picking people up and giving people rides," she says.</p> <p>Aldean speaks out</p> <p>Aldean posted a statement on Instagram saying that he and his crew were safe.</p> <p>"My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night. #heartbroken#stopthehate," he wrote.</p> <p>Two Las Vegas police officers are being treated at a hospital after they were injured during the shooting, Lombardo said. One is in critical condition, and the other had minor injuries.</p> <p>"Pray for Las Vegas," Mayor Goodman tweeted. "Thank you to all our first responders out there now."</p> <p>Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said on Twitter that a "tragic &amp;amp; heinous act of violence has shaken the #Nevada family" and offered prayers to all those affected by "this act of cowardice."</p> <p>'We just ran for our lives'</p> <p>Rachel De Kerf filmed her escape from the venue using her cell phone, starting just after the first shots were fired.</p> <p>She described ongoing gunfire, and played out the video she had recorded during which more than five minutes of gunfire were intermittently audible.</p> <p>"The gunshots lasted for 10-15 minutes. It didn't stop," she said. "We just ran for our lives."</p> <p>De Kerf's sister, Monique Dumas, said that everyone instantly crouched when they heard the shots.</p> <p>"The band was rushed off the stage, the floodlights came on the crowd, and you see on the right hand of the stage the person who was injured, so they're calling for medics, calling for security, then there was gunfire again," Dumas said.</p> <p>'Go, go, go'</p> <p>SiriusXM Country radio host Storme Warren was on the side of the stage as Aldean was performing when the shots rang out.</p> <p>"I thought it was fireworks going off and maybe it mistriggered, and then it happened again.

	<article id="0000821" published-at="2015-03-19" title="Bill O’Reilly Uses Anti-Semitic Dog Whistles Against George Soros To Hit Media Matters"><p>Bill O’Reilly sank to new lows last night when he attacked liberal philanthropist George Soros with anti-Semitic dog whistles. O'Reilly called Soros “the shadow puppet master behind corrupt far-left groups like Media Matters” and said he “has his tentacles into political organizations.” This, as Media Matters has been hammering O’Reilly over his many fabrications that have been uncovered recently.</p> <p>But first, O’Reilly used another, racial dog whistle to suggest President Obama is an uber welfare queen.</p> <p>It all happened in O’Reilly’s Talking Points commentary last night. It purported to be about the “Blockupy” protests in Frankfurt, Germany. Or, as O’Reilly said, “anti-capitalist violence on display.”</p> <p>But as with just about any subject on Fox, it wasn’t long before O’Reilly exploited this news story to go after Democrats. First, Obama:</p> <q> <p>O'REILLY: And it all comes back to the same thing: private enterprise being strangled by big government spending and regulations. Entitlements, free stuff, giving people the means to live—giving it to them, rather than having them earn their way.</p> <p>Here in America, President Obama is sympathetic to the big government economic intrusion.</p> </q> <p>Then Soros - after a swipe at Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders:</p> <q> <p>O'REILLY: We do have a quasi-socialistic senator in Elizabeth Warren, who if Hillary Clinton goes down, could compete in the Democratic sweepstakes for president. We also have Senator Bernie Sanders, a socialist, who Vermont voters have elected ten times. But the most frightening of all is this man, George Soros, billionaire who made huge money trading currencies rooting for countries to fail. Soros has now taken his ill-gotten gains and is financing the most radical left-wing organizations in America.</p> <p>He is a shadow puppet master behind corrupt far-left groups like Media Matters. Soros has his tentacles into political organizations like the Center for American Progress which has provided operatives for the Obama administration, some of whom are now going over to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.</p> <p>Few Americans even know who Soros is, but the 84-year-old uber leftist is behind much of the political strife in this country.

	<article id="0000822" published-at="2017-07-06" title="Fox’s Earhardt: Trump’s Tweets Prove He’s Perfect For Dealing With N. Korea And Russia"><p>Fox &amp;amp; Friends ignored the gift to Vladimir Putin that Donald Trump offered up during his press conference in Poland today. Instead cohost Ainsley Earhardt argued that Trump's attacks on American media make him "the kind of guy you're going to want" going up against North Korea and Putin.</p> <p>We can just imagine the Fox &amp;amp; Friends poutrage we’d have seen this morning if President Barack Obama attacked Fox News, our intelligence agencies and former President George W. Bush on foreign soil. But since it was Dear Leader Donald Trump attacking CNN, MSNBC, the intelligence community and Obama, it was all part of presidential Awesomeness!</p> <p>During his press conference in Poland, Trump made childish, vindictive and narcissistic comments when asked about his <a type="internal">Tweeted gif</a> showing him “wrestling” CNN:</p> <q> <p>TRUMP: I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them. As you know, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time. They have been covering me in a very, very dishonest way.</p> <p>[…]</p> <p>NBC is equally as bad, despite the fact that I made ‘em a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.</p> </q> <p>I’m old enough to remember when Fox <a type="internal">accused</a> <a type="internal">Obama</a> of not loving America. But with Trump in the White House, it's America's fault! After Trump attacked two large American media companies on foreign soil, cohost Ainsley Earhardt scolded the reporter for asking the question.</p> <q> <p>EARHARDT: It’s interesting, after a 15 minute press conference, the reporter stands up, and the first question is about North Korea and he coupled that with that CNN question about the wrestling video. It’s like, come on, can we talk about the issues?</p> </q> <p>On Fox, “talking about the issues” means praising Trump more substantively. So Kilmeade jumped in to argue that the Tweet was no reflection on Trump’s Awesome Things-That-Matter Awesomeness.</p> <q> <p>KILMEADE: I know you guys have thought about this, but hopefully people at home have put this together. I know the president comes out and he puts out these videos and people think, “that’s unpresidential” or “this is not right” or “this is different, why is he tweeting that?” But in the big picture, when things matter, when it comes to international security and world war, like North Korea, when it comes to relations with Russia, when it comes to the Middle East and Syria and ISIS, he is cool and calculated like a 40-year diplomatic veteran. Look at North Korea. We might have to take some very tough action against North Korea. He isn’t saying, “This little clown has no right doing this, he was given”—he’s being very cool and calculated and very—and parses his speech because he knows the impact.

She suggested that Trump’s Tweets were an integral part of Dear Leader’s Magnificence:</p> <q> <p>EARHARDT: Well, the very reason that the left doesn’t like him is because he’s not going to be intimidated. He will put these videos out there to say this is fake news. Yet, that’s the kind of guy that you’re going to want to represent the United States of America when he does have to come up against North Korea, when he does have to have talks tomorrow with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.

It was in response to NBC’s Hallie Jackson asking Trump if he would “definitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.”</p> <p>Trump’s answer was mind boggling. First, he equivocated, saying he thinks it was Russia but “it could have been” other countries, which undoubtedly pleased Putin <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/trump-poland-press-conference-c5b4c41c62c0" type="external">at the same time</a> that it undercut our own intelligence agencies. Trump also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/trump-obama-russian-election-meddling.html" type="external">falsely claimed</a> Obama “did nothing” about the Russia interference - which Trump had just refused to definitively acknowledge.</p> <p>So how did the Curvy Couch Cheerleaders respond? First, by showing a large banner that said, “THE MEDIA’S RUSSIAN OBSESSION.”</p> <p>Then cohost Doocy said contemptuously that Jackson had tried to ask a third question, despite the rules only allowing two. “Time ran out,” he sneered.</p> <p>Then Doocy changed the subject.</p> <p>Watch Fox News sell out the United States in favor of Trump below, from the July 6, 2017 Fox &amp;amp; Friends.</p></article>

We deeply regret the offense it caused”.</p> <p>Unilever, Dove’s parent company, have not responded to comment requests from Washington Post.</p> <p>Dove consumers took particular offence to what “missed the mark” pertains to. “What exactly were y’all going for?,” one self-described Dove consumer said on the company’s Facebook page. “What was the mark … I mean anyone with eyes can see how offensive this is.

	<article id="0000827" published-at="2018-01-05" title="FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation"><p>The FBI has been quietly investigating the Clinton Foundation for months, reviving a probe that was dialed back during the 2016 election amid tensions between Justice Department prosecutors and FBI agents about the politically charged case, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The investigation is being run out of the FBI’s field office in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the foundation has offices in the William J. Clinton Presidential Center, the people said. Agents are trying to determine if any donations made to the foundation were linked to official acts when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, these people said.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear what specific donations or interactions agents were scrutinizing, and there was some skepticism inside both the Justice Department and the FBI that the case would ultimately lead to any charges.</p> <p>The very existence of such a probe will likely lead to accusations from Democrats that the Republican administration is pursuing old, dead cases to punish political enemies.</p> <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and her aides. But while the Clinton Foundation investigation was effectively stopped in 2016, that stoppage at the time was described by people familiar with the matter as temporary because Justice Department officials were concerned that if details of the probe were to become public, it would appear that investigators were trying to hurt Clinton’s chances in the election.</p> <p>In a statement, Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said: “Time after time, the Clinton Foundation has been subjected to politically motivated allegations, and time after time these allegations have been proven false. None of this has made us waver in our mission to help people. The Clinton Foundation has demonstrably improved the lives of millions of people across America and around the world while earning top ratings from charity watchdog groups in the process. There are real issues in our society needing attention that the Clinton Foundation works hard to solve every day. So we’re going to stay focused on what really matters.”</p> <p>Republicans, in particular, have long raised concerns about what they viewed as corruption and conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation, in particular Hillary Clinton’s dealings with its donors while she was secretary of state.</p> <p>The Clinton Foundation probe dates back to 2015, when FBI agents in Los Angeles, New York, Little Rock and Washington, began looking at a variety of different figures who had made donations to the charity, based largely on news accounts, according to people familiar with the matter. In 2016, Justice Department prosecutors rejected a request from FBI agents to expand and intensify the foundation investigation, these people said.</p> <p>Republican lawmakers had called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions in July and again in September to explore various Clinton Foundation dealings, as well as other matters, by appointing a special counsel to look into Clinton-related issues. In November, the Justice Department wrote that Sessions would direct senior prosecutors to look into the cases about which they raised concerns and hinted that some might already be under investigation.</p> <p>Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that part of what the department would do was assess whether “any matters currently under investigation require further resources,” though he said his letter should not be construed as confirming or denying any probe.</p> <p>By that time, according to the people familiar with the matter, agents were already investigating the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>The Clinton Foundation inquiry is separate from the FBI’s high-profile investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, though Republicans have said that probe, too, needs to be reopened. The email investigation focused on whether Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information by using the private server. Then-FBI Director James Comey recommended in July 2016 the case be closed without charges, and though work on it briefly resumed in October - soon before the presidential election - he ultimately did not change his mind, and the Justice Department endorsed his recommendation.</p> <p>Justice Department officials have said senior prosecutors are also reviewing investigative records on the Clinton email case to see if any of the concerns raised by Republican lawmakers merit appointment of a special counsel for further investigation.</p> <p>The Clinton Foundation has raised billions of dollars since it was formed and generally receives high marks from philanthropy watchdog organizations. But, because of its global donor base and Hillary Clinton’s former position as America’s top diplomat, it also faced questions about contributions from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Algeria.</p></article>

And still women’s groups fawn over him, his charm and appeal to their causes.</p> <p>And our current president, Donald Trump, has also used his position, fame and money to lure in women. Unlike some of the others, his has been less hidden, as he has openly called women names, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/donald-trump-sexism-tracker-every-offensive-comment-in-one-place/" type="external">demeaning</a> them in one comment and action after another. Yet men and women both are forgetting all of that as long as America is “great again.”</p> Can we really separate the man from the method? <a href="http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/davidrupert/files/2017/10/jorge-flores-223750.jpg" type="external"/> Photo by Jorge Flores via CCLI Unsplash <p>You see, there is no politics when it comes to this kind of abuse. It crosses all lines. We so desperately want to shine the light on this kind of behavior and make it a “left-right” issue, but we can’t. It’s a “Wrong” issue.</p> <p>In all of these cases, I think it’s impossible to stand for the man when they won’t stand for the women in their life. How many of us voted for Bill Clinton or Donald Trump, knowing this was going on behind the scenes. “I don’t condone that behavior, but I sure like their political stands.”</p> <p>We can’t applaud the art, laugh at the jokes, pay for the entertainment.</p> <p>None of this is cute. None of this is excusable. Especially for those of us who claim Christ to be our King.</p> <p>Jesus was a prominent defender of women’s rights in his culture. Don’t believe me? Read it for yourself.</p> <p>His interactions with women were <a href="https://www.everystudent.com/wires/women.html" type="external">culture tweaking.</a> He spoke to them openly and as equals. A former prostitute was given full equality. He treated his mother with tenderness. His most amazing miracle, his resurrection, was first told to women who had the privilege to be the first to spread the news.</p> <p>Of all the major faiths, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Christianity" type="external">Christianty teaches men to treat women</a> as God sees them. Jesus broke all the rules of the day. He forbade the hierarchy of the day, giving equality to all men…and women.</p> <p>He went to the cross for women — our daughters, our wives, our mothers, our sisters.</p> <p>I am stunned that major political parties and even women’s rights groups promote and defend Islam, which <a href="https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/women-worth-less.aspx" type="external">demeans women</a> to the core. Many groups were applauding Saudi Arabia’s recent decision to allow their women to drive. “How progressive!”</p> <p>Can we drop our politics, just for a moment, to talk about our shared humanity?</p> <p>Every woman, no matter how strong and independent she is, admires the man who will stand up to defend the honor, the femininity, and the uniqueness of the woman in his life.</p> <p>Today, I see all kinds of men willing to stand up for the flag, but will we stand up for our women?</p></article>

And in a case like this guy, whether he was Muslim or not, he thought the same as most Muslims. He wants to kill unbelievers. He wants to kill people that he doesn’t like. Maybe he just didn’t like Las Vegas—I don’t know, and it probably doesn’t matter.”</p> </q> <p>He wants to kill unbelievers? In what universe, exactly? Half the wingnuts are claiming that he was an unbeliever and that he did this because he’s an atheist (without evidence, of course) and Pratt is claiming that he wants to kill unbelievers (again, without evidence).

In this moment, being proud of my country is to ignore the atrocities committed against people of color, people living in poverty, people who identify as women, and against my own queer community on a daily basis…</p> </q> <p>It didn’t matter whether or not you agree with his actions. The flag is merely a symbol, and burning it is perfectly legal. In 1989, the Supreme Court even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson" type="external">banned any statutes</a> that punished people for doing that. (Interesting trivia: Justice Antonin Scalia was in the 5-4 majority defending free speech. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor was on the other side.)</p> <p>Mellott was charged with flag desecration, which is still on the books as a <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=072000050K49-1" type="external">punishable offense</a> under Illinois law, but it’s a law that’s unenforceable.</p> <p>The official line from the police was that Mellott wasn’t arrested and detained for burning the flag but rather (in the ACLU’s words) to “ensure his own personal safety.”</p> <p>Earlier this year, Mellott, with the help of the ACLU of Illinois, <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/urbana-man-challenges-illinois-outdated-and-unconstitutional-flag-desecration-law/" type="external">announced</a> that he had filed a <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/001-Complaint-and-civil-cover-sheet.pdf" type="external">federal lawsuit</a> against the people involved in his arrest. His ultimate goal was to declare the flag desecration law unconstitutional:</p> <q> <p>“I hold the opinion that open dissent is the highest form of American patriotism;” Mr. Mellott said in prepared remarks announcing the lawsuit. “It was a frightening display of irony that on the Fourth of July, I should be taken from my workplace to sit in a county jail for exercising this liberty.”</p> … <p>“There simply was no justification for Bryton to be arrested for his political statement,” said Rebecca Glenberg, ACLU of Illinois senior staff attorney. “If police were concerned about Bryton’s safety, they should have taken action against whomever they thought was compromising his safety, not against the person engaged in constitutionally protected speech.”</p> <p>“We are asking the court to strike down the Illinois law to ensure that law enforcement in Urbana and across Illinois know that this statute cannot be enforced.” added Glenberg.</p> </q> <p>Both sides have now <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2017-09-18/urbana-man-gets-15000-settlement-flag-burning-lawsuit.html" type="external">settled the case</a>, but the compromise is decidedly in Mellott’s favor. He’ll get $15,000 along with an additional $20,000 for attorneys’ fees. The downside is that the statute against flag desecration, which is still unenforceable, remains on the books.</p> <q> <p>The Urbana Police Department and the officers’ attorney were unavailable for comment Monday after the announcement of the settlement. The defendants named were officers Kenneth Sprague, Jeremy Hale, Matthew McElhoe and Andrew Charles.</p> <p>…</p> <p>In a statement, Mellott said he was pleased with [Judge Colin] Bruce’s ruling that his actions were protected.</p> <p>“While this is a fact the police department should have known already, I certainly hope that they have learned from their mistake,” he said.</p> </q> <p>I hope they have, too. What those officers did was wrong, and it’s appalling they didn’t realize their mistake that day. The officers should have admitted their stupidity and apologized for what they did. Instead, it took an arrest and a lawsuit to get thousands of dollars and no comment.</p> <p>(Large portions of this article were posted earlier. Thanks to Brad for the link)</p></article>

Why is it happening?” he asked. “The fact that we have disrespect for authority; there is profound disrespect for our president, all across this nation they say terrible things about him. It’s in the news, it’s in other places. There is disrespect now for our national anthem, disrespect for our veterans, disrespect for the institutions of our government, disrespect for the court system. All the way up and down the line, disrespect.”</p> <p>“Until there is biblical authority,” Robertson continued, “there has to be some controlling authority in our society and there is none. And when there is no vision of God, the people run amok … and we have taken from the American people the vision of God, the whole idea of reward and punishment, an ultimate judge of all our actions, we’ve taken that away. When there is no vision of God, the people run amok.”</p> </q> <p>Robertson didn’t explain why so many mass shootings occurred before Donald Trump entered office and the NFL protests against racial injustice began… I’m sure there’s a logical explanation.</p> <p>Though I should mention that, when a man murdered people in a Sikh temple in 2012, Robertson <a type="internal">blamed atheists</a> who “hate God.” And last year, after the Pulse nightclub massacre, Robertson urged conservatives not to get involved and let LGBTQ people and radical Muslims “ <a type="internal">kill themselves</a>.”</p> <p>But this time?

About nine-in-ten U.S.-born (90%) and foreign-born (93%) Muslims say they are proud to be American, according to a 2017 <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/findings-from-pew-research-centers-2017-survey-of-us-muslims/" type="external">Pew Research Center survey</a>.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Like the larger American public, majorities of both U.S.-born Muslims and Muslim American immigrants say they believe people who want to get ahead can do so with hard work (65% and 73% respectively). Roughly six-in-ten of all Americans (62%) share this belief.</p> <p>However, U.S.-born Muslim Americans are less likely than immigrants to perceive positive feelings from their fellow Americans. Indeed, just three-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims say the American people are friendly toward Muslim Americans, compared to 73% of immigrants who feel this way.</p> <a type="internal"/> <a type="internal"/> <p>And U.S.-born Muslims are more likely than their immigrant counterparts to say there is discrimination against Muslims, and to say they have personally experienced at least one of several specific types of discrimination, such as people acting suspicious of them or calling them offensive names, being singled out by airport security or by some other law enforcement, or being physically attacked or threatened.</p> <p>Nine-in-ten (91%) U.S.-born Muslims say there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims, compared with 65% of immigrants who say this. And six-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims (61%) say that in the past 12 months they have experienced at least one of the specific types of discriminatory behavior asked about in the survey, compared with 39% of immigrants who say this. As might be expected, those who have personally experienced discrimination are more likely to say that there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims.</p> <p>U.S.-born Muslims also are more likely than immigrants to say that political institutions are unfriendly toward their group. For instance, most U.S.-born and foreign-born Muslims say the Democratic Party is “friendly” or “neutral” toward Muslim Americans, but immigrant Muslims are particularly likely to feel this way. Likewise, U.S.-born Muslims are more likely to say the Democratic Party is unfriendly (23%) than foreign-born Muslims (5%).</p> <p>And while many U.S. Muslims say that the Republican Party is unfriendly toward Muslim Americans, seven-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims hold this view, while only half of foreign-born Muslims say this.</p> <p>The same holds for views on President Trump.

	<article id="0000838" published-at="2017-12-27" title="The biggest moments of racism in 2017 | Solomon Jones"><a href="" type="external">Steve Helber / AP</a> In August 2017, white nationalist demonstrators walked into the entrance of Lee Park surrounded by counter demonstrators in Charlottesville, Va. The rally erupted in violence, killing Heather Heyer. It was one of the most racist moments of the year, says columnist Solomon Jones. <p>In 2017, racism not only won the day. It won the year.</p> <p>That’s my takeaway from a 12-month span that saw America inaugurate a president who ran on a hate-filled platform that denigrated and demeaned anyone who was not a white male. Some would say that another -ism — sexism — was the watchword for 2017. But I would argue that <a type="internal">the much-needed #MeToo movement</a>, which finally began the process of rightly punishing sexual predators, was the mirror we needed. It showed us that while sexism will be punished going forward, racism will remain the status quo.</p> <p>For those who doubt the veracity of that statement, I offer you the four biggest moments in racism from the year 2017.</p> 1. The inauguration of Donald Trump President Trump walks with first lady Melania Trump during the inauguration parade. <p>The January ceremony was the crowning achievement of a candidate who replaced the veiled racism of past presidential hopefuls with the overt bigotry of a man who doesn’t give a damn.</p> <p>Trump understood the racial resentment that many Americans harbored after eight years under Barack Obama, America’s first black president, and Trump used it to his advantage. Having benefited from five years of peddling the racist lie that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore unqualified to be president, Trump repeatedly returned to the well of racism.</p> <p>Trump asserted that undocumented Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals. Trump proposed that Muslims — most of whom are black and brown — should be banned from the United States. Trump said a judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump’s company could not rule fairly because of the judge’s Mexican heritage, prompting House Speaker Paul Ryan to say, “ <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip0c-Z4KjYAhUHRN8KHenPAPQQFggwMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fstory%2F2016%2F06%2Fpaul-ryan-trump-judge-223991&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GsyO-CK6GiUro7cVAOyzq" type="external">Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment.</a>”</p> <p>But Ryan still backed Trump for president, as did the vast majority of the GOP. That’s what led to the inauguration of Donald Trump, and paved the way for the normalization of racism.</p> 2. The travel ban People carry posters during a rally in Times Square. The rally was held in support of American Muslims and against President Trump’s executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority nations. <p>In January, shortly after his inauguration, Trump penned an executive order that he said was focused on keeping America safe from terrorists. But <a type="internal">many, including myself, saw it as an attempt to implement Trump’s ban on Muslims entering the country.</a></p> <p>The ban initially applied to travelers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. It also permanently banned refugees from Syria.</p> <p>For those keeping score, these countries are primarily composed of black and brown people. And none of these countries is Chechnya, home to the white Muslims who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing. After various court battles over the ban, the Trump administration fashioned a third version that included North Korea and Venezuela — two non-Muslim countries. The Supreme Court then allowed the travel ban to be implemented while court challenges continue.</p> <p>That, my friends, tells everyone who’s watching that in the eyes of America, terrorists are only black and brown people who practice certain religions. <a type="internal">They’re not white guys who shoot hundreds of people from a hotel room in Las Vegas.</a></p> 3. The rise of the (In)justice Department Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference at the Philadelphia Convention Center. <p>Nothing says racism like a Justice Department decision to “review” consent decrees calling on police departments to change their patterns of abusing black people.</p> <p>But in April, Jeff Sessions, the former Alabama senator who is now the U.S. attorney general, saw no problem with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/04/04/jeff-sessions-plan-to-undermine-police-reform-and-civil-rights/?utm_term=.6b1ecd9104cb" type="external">essentially shelving the Justice Department agreements made with 14 abusive police departments under the Obama administration.</a> At the time, Sessions told a conservative radio host that consent decrees can “ <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/14/politics/kfile-sessions-consent-decrees/index.html" type="external">reduce the morale of the police officers.</a>”</p> <p>That’s an interesting viewpoint. Here’s mine: Nothing lowers morale more than being shot dead by a police officer because your skin color was perceived as a threat.</p> 4. Charlottesville A photo of Heather Heyer rests among a makeshift memorial in Charlottesville, Va. Heyer was struck and killed by a car while protesting a white nationalist rally in August. <p><a type="internal">When thousands of neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered to protest the removal of a Confederate monument</a>from a liberal college town in Virginia, it was the culmination of Donald Trump’s quest to normalize racism. Can you imagine a large-scale march of white supremacists taking place in 2007, or 1997? How about 1987? Neither can I.</p> <p>Nor can I imagine the president of the United States saying both sides are to blame when violence erupts from such a march, yet that’s what Donald Trump said in 2017 — the year that race relations went backward.</p> <p>Trump said anti-racism protesters were partly to blame for the Charlottesville violence even after 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed. She died when reputed neo-Nazi sympathizer James Fields, 20, allegedly drove his car into a crowd of anti-racism protesters. Fields was subsequently charged with first-degree murder in Heyer’s death.</p> <p>The fact that Heyer was a white woman is significant, because her willingness to stand up against white supremacists tells an irrefutable truth: Not everyone is a racist.</p> <p>And that fact, more than anything else I saw in 2017, gives me hope. It tells me that perhaps things can change as America drags the heavy weight of racism into a new year.</p> <p>Solomon Jones is the author of 10 books.

	<article id="0000844" published-at="2018-01-11" title="Trump Threatens to Deal Another Blow to the Palestinian Cause">
President Trump walks with Palestinian President Abbas at a reception ceremony in Bethlehem, May 23, 2017. (Reuters photo: Mohamad Torokman) <p>By cutting off hundreds of millions in American aid to the Palestinian Authority, the president could radically alter the Middle East.</p> <p>President Trump set off another Twitter firestorm last week when he hinted that he may be considering cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in annual U.S. aid to the Palestinians. Trump was angered over Palestinian unwillingness to engage in peace talks with Israel after the Trump administration announced the move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.</p> <p>Given that the U.S. channels its Palestinian aid through third-party United Nations organizations, it’s unclear how much money Trump is talking about it. But in total it may exceed $700 million per year, according to reports.</p> <p>A decade ago, the U.S. row with the Palestinian Authority would have been major news. But not now.</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>The entire Middle East has radically changed — and along with it the role and image of the Palestinians.</p> <p>First, the U.S. is now one of the largest producers of fossil-fuel energy in the world. America is immune from the sort of Arab oil embargo that in 1973–74 paralyzed the U.S. economy as punishment for American support of Israel. Even Israel, thanks to new offshore oil and natural-gas discoveries, is self-sufficient in energy and immune from Arab cutoffs.</p> <p>Second, the Middle East is split into all sorts of factions. Iran seeks to spread radical Shiite theocracy throughout Iraq and Syria and into the Persian Gulf states — and is the greatest supporter of Palestinian armed resistance. The so-called “moderate” Sunni autocracies despise Iran. Understandably, most Arab countries fear the specter of a nuclear Iran far more than they do the reality of a democratic and nuclear Israel.</p> <p>A third player — radical Islamic terrorism — has turned against the Arab status quo as well as the West. Because Palestinian organizations such as Hamas had flirted with Iran and its appendages (such as the terrorists of Hezbollah), they have become less useful to the Arab establishment. The terrorist bloodlettings perpetrated by groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda have discredited terror as a legitimate means to an end in the eyes of the Arab world, despite previous support for Palestinian terrorists.</p> <p>Third, the world itself may have passed the Palestinian issue by.</p> <p>Israel was founded in 1948. Palestinian rhetoric that they would push the Jews into the sea is by now stale. There have been seven decades of failed intifadas and suicide-bombing campaigns, along with full-scale Arab–Israeli wars.</p> <p>Equally futile were endless “peace processes,” “peace initiatives,” “road maps,” and “multiparty talks,” plus Middle East “conferences,” “summits,” and “memoranda” all over the world, from Madrid and Oslo to Camp David.</p> <p>In the meantime, most other “refugees” the world over have long ago moved on. Around the time Israel was created, some 13 million German speakers were ethnically cleansed from East Prussia and Eastern Europe. The word “Prussia” no longer exists as a geographical or national label. Seven decades later, the grandchildren of refugees do not replay World War II. “Prussians” do not talk about reclaiming their ancestral homelands in present-day Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. German-speaking youth do not demand a “right of return” to their grandparents’ homes to the east.</p> <p>Fourth, the Palestinians have never been able to craft a successful, transparent, consensual government. After 30 years of waiting, the world has mostly given up on their rhetoric of self-government and reform on the West Bank.</p> <p>Since the Palestinian proclamation of independence in 1988, there have been only two “presidents”: Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas. Neither has allowed open and transparent elections. A Palestinian president gets power by seizing it. He loses it only by dying in office. Over the same period, Israel has elected seven different prime ministers from a variety of political parties.</p> <p>The Palestinian political party Fatah is engaged in a deadly rivalry with the terrorist-inspired Hamas organization that has run Gaza for over a decade. The beef is not over democracy, but over which faction will bury the other.</p> <p>The Palestinians’ inability to rule the West Bank in constitutional fashion is why hundreds of thousands of expatriate Palestinians voice their solidarity from a safe distance while living in North America or Europe. More than a million Palestinians prefer to stay put in Israel. They are convinced that they will have more security, freedom, and prosperity in a democratic state than under dictatorial Palestinian rule a few miles away.</p> <p>Trump may be rash and unfamiliar with the stagnant Middle East peace process, but his political instincts are probably correct. Polls show that less than 20 percent of Americans support the Palestinian cause. Many U.S. citizens are tired of subsidizing those who claim that they do not like their benefactors in the United States.</p> <p>It finally may be time for the Palestinian factions to fund their own causes and go their own ways.</p> <p>READ MORE:</p> <p>— Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and the author of the recently released The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won. © 2018 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></article>
	<article id="0000845" published-at="2016-11-02" title="Trump Can Fix It">
Trump campaigns in Johnstown, Pa., October 21, 2016. (Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst) <p>It is hard to believe that this clangorous campaign of defamations is in its last week. Of course, in the first year of Donald Trump’s largely self-financed campaign, which broke all records for the sale of silly T-shirts, hats, and badges, his pandering was sometimes outrageous, but it was brilliant. As Senator Marco Rubio said as he bowed out of the race, having been bombed in his home state of Florida by Trump by nearly a million votes, “There was a tsunami approaching and only Mr. Trump saw it.”</p> <p>The political class that had admitted 12 million illegal immigrants, while waffling about “comprehensive immigration reform” and doing nothing, complacently assumed that the country had acquiesced in this cynical outrage. After all, someone had to do the menial work in the U.S. It was a pandemic of almost terminal hypocrisy and when Donald Trump focused national attention on it, he had to be defamed as a racist. Donald Trump has a big mouth and a loose tongue, but he has, unlike many of his accusers, a perfect record as an equal-opportunity employer, and there is not a scintilla of evidence that he is a racist.</p> <p>He was probably correct that the judge of whom he complained was biased, but was unrigorous and very ungracious in imputing this to his ancestry. Mr. Trump is a great talent, but rigor and grace, like modesty, are not at the forefront of his fine qualities. Not as easily dismissed are Mr. Trump’s attacks on several of the free-trade agreements in place or contemplation. He has no problem with Canada as a fair-trading partner of comparable per capita wealth to the United States, and offered the United Kingdom a free-trade deal with minimal negotiations if it does depart the European Union as it has voted to do.</p> <p>What he objects to are free-trade agreements that amount to the importation of unemployment into the United States. There is nothing intellectually wrong with this; the desire of all Americans for cheaper goods and natural resources and agricultural products should be balanced against the interests of the U.S. work force. This is not a euphemism for protectionism that allows uncompetitive American enterprises to milk a tariff-insulated market. This was the greatest and most continuous political issue in the United States from the Civil War to the end of World War II, and Trump does not deserve to be branded as a Luddite guardian of feather-bedding and monopolistic practices.</p> <p>Just as outrageous was the portrayal of Trump as a misogynist. His personal conversation is less coarse than Mrs. Clinton’s, and the tape of his exchange eleven years ago with Billy Bush (of the ubiquitous Bushes), while repulsive, was not how he speaks. He shut Hillary down for months by pointing out that she was an enabler of the most egregious “objectifier” of women in American presidential history, and her campaign waited until they must have thought it unanswerable to drop this fragmentation grenade. Trump apologized for his comments, and entered the second presidential debate under greater pressure than anyone in the history of these exchanges, going back to Kennedy and Nixon in 1960. His campaign was disintegrating. An inconvenient fact, which the Washington media chose not to recognize, is that he overcame the Bush-tape disaster and won the last two debates; qualities of leadership do lurk beneath his efflorescent egotism.</p> <p>This election has not been so dismal in policy terms. Mrs. Clinton, thanks to the unelected party grandees who are ex officio delegates — the same people who sandbagged her eight years ago in favor of Obama — narrowly beat off a cuckoo challenge from a democratic Marxist. Senator Sanders was magnificently correct in excoriating the essentially totalitarian American prosecutorial system, and even in his objections to excessive concessions to Wall Street engineers of the velocity of money, but his general tax policy, neutral-isolationist foreign policy, and trenchant clamping of his lips around the (unnatural) gas-pipe of global warming, made him an implausible candidate. And Donald Trump, while recruiting the blue-collar reactionaries and bringing them back into the political system after decades of sullen abstention, favors universal health care and a generous hand to disadvantaged African Americans. Both candidates have a sane foreign policy, which would steer between the mindless interventionism of George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s Panglossian appeasement of America’s enemies.</p> <p>In England, in the last two weeks, I engaged in three widely publicized debates about the U.S. election. The British public largely clings to the view that the United States is a useful oaf of a country of philistines which occasionally tosses up “one of us” like FDR or JFK, and my audiences had drunk the anti-Trump Kool Aid. I opened each time by predicting that there would not be, because there could not be, any argument for the reelection of the Democrats. Their only campaign has been to smear Trump, whose antics have made him an easy target. Because George H.W. Bush was the only president since Theodore Roosevelt who had sons with an aptitude for politics, and Bill Clinton was the only president since Franklin Roosevelt who had a wife with an aptitude for politics, those two families held one of the three greatest public offices in the country for 32 years from 1981 to 2013, and have handed these positions back and forth between each other. Coincidentally, the last 20 years have been the worst period of presidential misgovernment in the country’s history, surpassing even the twelve years before the Civil War, and between Wilson and FDR.</p> <p>Practically all commentators predicted a race of polemical vehemence unlike any since 1800, when Thomas Jefferson exchanged slanders and libels with John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, and the shadowy maneuverer Aaron Burr almost emerged as president. It was always going to be portrayed as a race between the grotesque caricatures of the Ugly American braggart and materialist and the sleazeball superannuated feminist. When it became clear that Trump had tapped into an electoral geyser (which to me was when he took 49 percent of the minority Republican vote in the arch-liberal state of Massachusetts in a 14-candidate race), and that he would be nominated, it was also clear that he would, in the words of George Wallace nearly 50 years ago, shake the political class “by the eyeteeth.” It is often hard not to adapt to Trump FDR’s comment on his mentor and rival, Alfred E. Smith, that he “loved him for his enemies.”</p> <q> <p>Trump is the only person who might clean out this Augean stable.</p> </q> <p>In the end, the majority of Americans could be persuaded not to vote for Trump, as the candidate not complicit in the decline of America these past 20 years, only if they were so horrified by his vulgarity that they overlooked the poor performance of the Bush-Clinton-Obama regency and the ethical frailties of the Democrats. Trump’s offenses are matters of taste, not indictable transgressions, and the revolt of the FBI against the sleazy straddle of Director James Comey’s verbal condemnation of Mrs. Clinton as a perjurer while declining to indict her has blown the race open. Mrs. Clinton has tried to ignore the revelations that her chief aide, Huma Abedin, may have perjured herself, as she has ignored the FBI director’s assertion that she herself lied under oath. She merely “short-circuited” her FBI interrogators. Rabid partisans like James Carville and Tim Ryan have claimed a conspiracy between the Kremlin, the FBI, Trump, and nameless hobgoblins. It was like Alexander Haig’s conjuration of an “unknown spirit” that erased Rosemary Woods’s Watergate tape in 1973. Trump’s manager, Kellyanne Conway, accurately explained why what has occurred is more odious than Watergate. Richard Nixon, an outstanding president, was crucified, though he never lied under oath and there is no convincing evidence that he personally broke any laws. It is time to write history, including current history, straight.</p> <p>The sadness of Peggy Noonan that the country has been let down by inferior candidates is understandable, but fails to credit Trump for unerringly following a trail no one saw: First he was Archie Bunker, then a lightning rod for excessive abuse, then impresario of the revelation of intolerable ethical strains in the Clinton campaign. Less creditable are the intelligent commentators like Daniel Henninger, who denounced the Hillary Clinton administration as if recounting history, Franklin Pierce or Warren Harding — implicitly expressing anger that Trump wasn’t a respectable enough Republican candidate to deny the move into the White House of the Clinton pay-to-play casino. And most distasteful of all are the sanctimonious conservative intellectuals who departed Trump to legitimize the Clinton sleaze factory, with the feigned majesty of those who felt entitled to name the Republican candidate, and whose public twitches and reflections were bound to shape the intellectual conscience of America. The friendship of decades with many of them prevents my mentioning names. The worst of them are those who accused Trump of fascistic tendencies and even of anti-Semitism. Everyone upon whom the country had the right to rely has failed: the traditional party elders, the national media, the conservative intellectuals, the engineers and conductors of the great liberal gravy train.</p> <p>In the last week of this tumultuous campaign, Donald Trump, however raucous his delivery, has emerged as the candidate of comparative integrity, and the only person who might clean out the Augean stable of the American political system. Unless Hillary Clinton, whose considerable gifts have never included an excess of spontaneous originality, can pull from the tattered Democratic hat a miraculous Brobdingnagian bunny, the doors of the White House will be opened to the greatest, if far from the most elegant, personal political crusade in American history.</p> <p>— Conrad Black is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D0V13WK/ref=nosim/nationalreviewon" type="external">Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0052TWKQ6/ref=nosim/nationalreviewon" type="external">Richard M.

(Image: REUTERS / Twitter) <p>A prominent black rights campaigner has hit back after being accused of pretending to be mixed race when he is allegedly white, in a case which echoes that of Rachel Dolezal.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter leader Shaun King won a full-ride scholarship intended for black men from Oprah Winfrey to attend college.</p> <p>The 35-year-old is a high profile social activist, campaigning against police brutality towards African Americans, the New York Post reported.</p> <p>King, who says he is the son of a Caucasian mother and an African-American father, has written extensively about racial tensions he experienced while growing up.</p> <p>But an investigative blogger has come forward accusing King of being a fraud and claiming he is actually 100% white, Breitbart reported.</p> <p>Vicki Pate, from the Re-NewsIt blog, claims to have probed King's family tree and alleges that his birth certificate lists his father, Jeffery Wayne King, as being white, not black.</p> <p>His place of birth is reportedly listed as Versailles, Kentucky - where only one Jeffery Wayne King apparently lives in the entire state.</p> <p>Police mugshots following multiple arrests of a man of the same name show he is clearly Causcasian, the blogger claims.</p> <p>King Sr's date of birth matches that shown on Shaun King's birth certificate and Pate even claims brother Russ King, a white man, confirmed the man in the mugshots is their father.</p> <p>King took to Twitter to refute Pate's claims, branding the Breitbart article a "white supremacist conspiracy".</p> <p>The case bears striking similarities to that of disgraced race activist Rachel Dolezal.</p> <p>Dolezal, who resigned from the <a type="internal">National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People</a> (NAACP) after being outed as white, insisted “I identify as black” on US television.</p> <p>She said she had identified as black from the age of five but had the white identity "thrust" upon her until she was strong enough to embrace her true self.</p> <p>The 37-year-old carried out her racial charade for years before her estranged parents outed her as white.</p> <p>Dolezal, who alters her appearance to look African-American, told America's Today show she had considered herself black for almost her entire life.</p></article>

The director himself has said he doesn't know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not. I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July," she told reporters.</p> <p>In a letter to members of Congress, FBI director James Comey revealed new messages have been found that are "pertinent to the investigation".</p> <p>In July, FBI officials had recommended that no charges should be brought over the controversy which centres around Ms Clinton's use of a private email server to exchange messages with staff and other officials.</p> <p>Her use of a private email server led many to think she was hiding secret information and putting the nation’s security at risk however she did not face a trial over the allegations.</p> <p>Officials say the emails were discovered after the FBI seized devices belonging to Clinton campaign aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner.</p> <p>He is being investigated after allegedly sending inappropriate messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.</p> <p>The White House has said it first learned of the decision to re-open the probe in the media – but that President Obama's view of Ms Clinton has not changed as a candidate.</p> <p>Her campaign chief John Podesta said the announcement's timing was “extraordinary” less than two weeks before the election.</p> <p>He continued: “FBI Director Comey should immediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee.</p> <p>"Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is ‘reopening’ an investigation but Comey’s words do not match that characterization.</p> <p>"Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.”</p> <p>Her rival Donald Trump was quick to react to the announcement saying the decision not to lay charges over the emails was a "grave miscarriage of justice" and added: "Perhaps justice will finally be done."</p> <p>He said: "Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.</p> <p>"I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.</p> <p>"This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody’s hope that it is about to be corrected.”</p> <p>Addressing cheering crowds at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, he then joked about whether he should continue his speech at all.</p> <p>He said: "With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech?"</p> <p>During the speech he also said the email controversy was "bigger than Watergate" – the 1970s political scandal over a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters that led to the resignation of then-president Richard Nixon.</p> <p>In his letter to Congress, Mr Comey wrote: "In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server.</p> <p>"Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.</p> <p>"In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.</p> <p>"I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."</p> <p>But the new revelations have sparked anger among some members of the Democratic Party who claim Mr Comey has not given enough specifics despite making such a significant announcement just 10 days before Americans head to the polls.</p> <p>Ms Clinton has repeatedly clashed with Donald Trump over the issue, with the Democratic candidate admitting during the first presidential debate that she had made a mistake by using the system during her time as US secretary of state.</p> <p>She landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a campaign stop just minutes after the FBI announcement but has so far not made any comment.</p> <p>Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said the letter raises "serious questions" and called for Ms Clinton to be removed from the presidential race.</p> <p>He added: "The FBI's decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's secret email server just eleven days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be.</p> <p>"This stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law.</p> <p>"What's indisputable is that Hillary Clinton jeopardized classified information on thousands of occasions in her reckless attempt to hide pay-to-play corruption at her State Department.</p> <p>"This alone should be disqualifying for anyone seeking the presidency, a job that is supposed to begin each morning with a top secret intelligence briefing."</p> <p>Bookmakers Betfair have also increased Trump's odds of winning the US election from 17% to 23%.</p> <p>While campaigning in Pennsylvania, his vice presidential candidate <a type="internal">Mike Pence</a> urged the FBI to "immediately release all the emails" so they can be seen by the American people before election day.</p></article>

	<article id="0000852" published-at="2017-12-14" title="Do Republicans Believe Their Own Lies?"><p>In early 2010, Republican Scott Brown unexpectedly won a special election for a Senate seat in Massachusetts. Even though this put passage of Obamacare in mortal danger, President Obama urged Congress not to move ahead until Brown had been seated. They didn’t. Now, Democrats are urging Republicans to play equally fair and not move ahead with their tax bill until Doug Jones is seated following his win in the Alabama special election. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/13/politics/president-donald-trump-doug-jones-tax-vote/index.html" type="external">Donald Trump isn’t buying the comparison:</a></p> <q> <p>A White House official told CNN on Wednesday that the Brown example is different because Democrats passed health care in 2010 using a process that allowed them to do so with only a 50-vote majority — at the time, they had more than 50 Democrats — rendering Brown’s vote less critical.</p> </q> <p>The truth is just the opposite. The Senate passed Obamacare under regular order, which meant Democrats needed 60 votes to overcome Republican filibusters. With the election of Brown, their majority was reduced to 59 votes, which means that Brown’s election was more critical than Jones’s.</p> <p>But here’s the question: was this just a garden variety lie, or does the anonymous official really believe what he said? The reason I ask is that Republicans have been telling the story of Democrats “jamming” Obamacare down their throats using tricky parliamentary procedures for so long that, as near as I can tell, most of them believe it these days. Even though it was only seven years ago, this story has been repeated so often they’ve literally forgotten that it’s not true. But it’s not. After Obamacare was passed normally by both House and Senate, it was only a small “sidecar” that was added under reconciliation procedures that required 50 votes. But the sidecar was optional. Even without it, the vast bulk of Obamacare had already passed.</p> <p>So: was the White House flack lying, or is he just another Republican who’s come to sincerely believe his own lies? Hard to say. So here’s another question: Why would CNN pass this quote along without explaining that it’s wrong? That’s also hard to say.</p></article>

Based on scores from DW-NOMINATE, the answer is almost certainly yes:</p> <p>Negative numbers are liberal, so Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley give an idea of the current far-left pole of the Democratic Party, while Mike Lee and James Risch are at the far-right pole of the Republican Party. Doug Jones will clearly be the most culturally liberal senator from Alabama since the New Deal, and depending on how he compares to Hugo Black, the most economically liberal too.</p> <p>By the way, if DW-NOMINATE scores are to be believed, Jeff Sessions (the lower black diamond) was the previous record-holder for most culturally liberal senator from Alabama in recent history.

Republican candidate for President Donald J Trump speaks to supporters at a rally at Ambridge Area Senior High School on Oct. 10, 2016 in Ambridge, Pa. <p>There’s no denying the damage Donald Trump’s campaign has suffered since Friday afternoon. An audio clip from 2005 in which Trump bragged about sexual assault has thrown his candidacy and his party into turmoil, further undermining a campaign that was already losing.</p> <p>As Rachel noted on the show, however, more tapes may yet surface. Indeed, with four weeks remaining before Election Day, and rumors swirling, it wouldn’t surprise anyone if additional recordings created new embarrassments for the controversial Republican presidential candidate.</p> <p>But don’t worry, Republicans, Trump has a plan. In fact, as Yahoo News <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-ill-talk-even-more-about-bill-clintons-accusers-if-more-lewd-tapes-are-released-220854900.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma" type="external">reported</a> yesterday, the GOP nominee hopes to stop future tapes with a new threat.</p> <q>
 Amid rumors of potentially more tapes showing him making inappropriate comments in the past, Donald Trump issued a threat to rival Hillary Clinton, saying Monday that if he keeps getting attacked, he’ll keep talking about the women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault and harassment. […] Rumors have swirled of other potentially damaging videos from his days as host of “The Apprentice” and other past interviews floating around. And Trump seemed to confirm there could be more shoes to drop and issued a threat to his critics. “They want to release more tapes [of me] saying inappropriate things, we’ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things,” the GOP nominee declared. </q> <p>NBC News posted the video of these remarks online <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-if-they-release-more-tapes-we-ll-continue-to-talk-about-bill-clinton-782999619631?cid=sm_tw" type="external">here</a>.</p> <p>This is not a smart strategy.</p> <p>First, Trump obviously believes there are additional recordings of him “saying inappropriate things,” as he put it, which will only encourage researchers to keep digging, knowing there’s more newsworthy content out there.</p> <p>Second, the Republican nominee apparently assumes those in the media doing research on Trump’s record are partisans, motivated solely by Clinton’s electoral interests, which he believes makes his threat potent. That’s absurd. Plenty of journalists are investigating Trump’s record because he’s a candidate for the nation’s highest office, not because they want Clinton to win. Threatening them by saying more tapes will mean more anti-Clinton attacks will have no effect.</p> <p>And finally, whether Trump realizes this or not, he’s already fired the big gun. Over the weekend, Trump ignored his party’s advice, turned back the clock 20 years, and decided assorted Bill Clinton accusers of varying degrees of credibility are now a central part of his campaign message.</p> <p>And it landed with a thud. As was the case in the 1990s, the attacks impressed no one except rabid far-right activists who were already going to support Trump anyway.</p> <p>In effect, his threat last night amounted to, “Stop making me look bad or I’ll repeat an ineffective attack!”</p></article>
	<article id="0000859" published-at="2016-10-11" title="Why Trump's latest Benghazi theory matters more than most">
PHOTOBLOG: People stand near a burnt car at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. <p>Donald Trump has said so many strange things about the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, it may be tempting to look past his latest tirade, assuming it’s more of the same. But when it comes to the Republican candidate’s rhetoric last night, don’t be too quick to dismiss it out of hand.</p> <p>Trump addressed a crowd in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where he talked about Benghazi while holding a piece of paper in his hand. According to the GOP nominee, he was holding the printout of an email Sidney Blumenthal sent John Podesta – two prominent Hillary Clinton allies – in which, Trump said, Blumenthal “admitted they could have done something about Benghazi.”</p> <p>As the crowd chanted, “Lock her up!” Trump dropped the printout and said, “This just came out a little while ago.”</p> <p>So, what was Trump referring to? This gets a little complicated, but stick with me.</p> <p>Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald wrote <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/benghazi-biopsy-comprehensive-guide-one-americas-worst-political-outrages-385853" type="external">a lengthy piece</a> about Benghazi a year ago, which acknowledged, among other things, missteps from Clinton’s State Department in advance of the attack. Blumenthal emailed the article to Podesta, now Clinton’s campaign chairman, whose emails were recently hacked, probably by Russian officials, and published online by Wikileaks.</p> <p>Yesterday, a Russian-controlled news agency screwed up the details, and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201610101046200602-hillary-benghazi-wikileaks-podesta-emails/" type="external">published</a> what it characterized as a bombshell: “Blumenthal believed that the investigation into Benghazi was legitimate because it was ‘preventable’ and the result of State Department negligence.” Apparently, Sputnik thought Blumenthal wrote Eichenwald’s Newsweek piece, and interpreted last year’s article, which has been online for 12 months and is consistent with everything we know about Benghazi, as a new, “major revelation.”</p> <p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635" type="external">Eichenwald asked</a> last night:</p> <q>
 This false story was reported only by the Russian-controlled agency (a reference appeared in a Turkish publication, but it was nothing but a link to the Sputnik article). So how did Donald Trump end up advancing the same falsehood put out by Putin’s mouthpiece? […] The Russians engage in a sloppy disinformation effort and, before the day is out, the Republican nominee for president is standing on a stage reciting the manufactured story as truth. How did this happen? Who in the Trump campaign was feeding him falsehoods straight from the Kremlin? </q> <p>Those need not be rhetorical questions.</p> <p>Remember, as far as Trump is concerned, “This just came out a little while ago.” But as it turns out, “this” refers to a bogus article from the Russian government’s news website, which published a mistaken report just hours ahead of Trump’s rally, where he read the nonsense directly from a piece of paper.</p> <p>I certainly don’t expect Trump or his campaign to acknowledge the fact that he was lying to his supporters in Pennsylvania last night, but it’d be interesting to learn more about how this came about. How did the mistake go from Russia’s government in the morning, literally into Trump’s hands in the evening?</p> <p>Update: The Washington Post, breaking down the timeline in detail, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/11/the-trump-putin-link-that-wasnt/" type="external">makes the case</a> that Sputnik ”has a reasonably large audience: A million people like it on Facebook, and nearly 200,000 follow it on Twitter,” which means any number of people could’ve shared it with the campaign.</p> <p>The piece added that this incident largely only proves that Trump “will happily pick any news off the Internet and broadcast it to the world, accurate or not.”</p></article>

(Photo by Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty) <p>The week’s major news story came in the form of <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a>, the real estate tycoon and reality television star now turned American president-elect. His victory over longtime public servant <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> stunned the world. As election results were announced early Wednesday morning, Americans and viewers around the world responded with shock and some with sadness.</p> <p>Fights between Trump supporters and protesters soon broke out in front of the White House and in Times Square. Reports of attacks on Muslims and people of color began to surface as only hours after the announcement, putting many on edge. By Wednesday night, protests had spread across the nation, including New York City, Chicago, Miami and Oakland, California.</p> <p>The president-elect has his work cut out for him in terms of uniting the country and proving to the majority population — who gave the popular vote to Clinton — that he is trustworthy. But Trump is off to a tumultuous start, already creating controversy with his cabinet picks, by bucking the press pool tradition on his trip to meet President Obama at the White House on Thursday, and going on a quick Twitter rant about demonstrators protesting against his win.</p> <p>Protesters also held signs in solidarity with indigenous communities who have been protesting the Dakota Access pipeline at Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The ongoing demonstrations seems now even more urgent as Trump’s “100 day plan” includes lifting the “restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal,” and lifting “Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward.”</p> <p>Elsewhere, the fighting in Mosul, Iraq, surges on, as in Aleppo — where airstrikes injured civilians again this week.</p> <p>In Greece, demonstrations for education reform and funding overtook Athens.</p></article>

House Speaker Paul Ryan at CPAC 2016 in March. (Photo: Gage Skidmore) <p>The House speaker could have left Trump alone rather than stab him in the back.</p> <p>Having suffered the political equivalent of a blown tire while driving along an icy mountain road on Friday night, GOP nominee Donald J. Trump stabilized a seemingly fatal situation by Sunday evening. Through his commanding, issue-driven performance against Hillary Clinton in the second presidential debate, Trump steered his vehicle into a turnout. He replaced the flat with a new steel-belted radial and readied himself to return to the challenging road ahead.</p> <p>But on Monday morning, House speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) raced in, slashed Trump’s tire anew, and nudged him toward the closest cliff.</p> <p>Ryan could have left things alone, with Trump’s Access Hollywood tape receding in the rear-view mirror. Instead, Ryan donned his peacock feathers for an especially flamboyant display of moral preening.</p> <p>Ryan erased the gap that Trump had placed between his candidacy and this controversy. Rather than let it be, Ryan dragged this whole episode back into the middle of the road.</p> <p>During a conference call with GOP House members on Monday, Ryan reportedly announced that he neither would defend Trump nor campaign with him between now and Election Day. Naturally, pro-Clinton journalists (forgive the redundancy) fanned this hot coal into a forest fire.</p> <p>Ryan could maintain his perch atop the moral high ground and do so quietly. He simply could go about his business and avoid Trump’s events. He could respond to journalists’ questions about the GOP nominee with bromides such as “I wish Donald Trump well and look forward to winning a larger House Republican majority on the night he wins the White House.”</p> <p>This would have maintained peace on the right.</p> <p>Instead, the day after Trump’s solid debate effort became the new narrative, Ryan needlessly fathered the unprecedented phenomenon of a Republican standard-bearer and a Republican speaker in open warfare with each other — just four weeks before a general election.</p> <p>More than merely foolish politics, this episode exposes the reputedly level-headed Ryan as truly, deeply morally warped.</p> <p>Everyone agrees that Trump’s comments about women (including references to female genitalia) were disappointing and inappropriate. Trump apologized for them twice before the latest debate and did so again at Sunday’s face-off against Clinton.</p> <p>“This was locker-room talk,” Trump <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/2016-presidential-debate-transcript-229519#ixzz4MtNfXnDp" type="external">told</a> a town hall in St. Louis. “I am not proud of it. I apologized to my family. I apologized to the American people. . . . I am very embarrassed by it, and I hate it, but it’s locker-room talk.”</p> <p>(Remember: Trump’s words from 2005 are at issue here, not his actions. Conversely, Bill Clinton’s actual behavior somehow is no big deal. Journalists, feminists, and Democrats seem utterly uninterested in his sexual shenanigans with Monica Lewinsky, his widely acknowledged sexual harassment of Paula Jones, his alleged sexual assault of Kathleen Willey, and even a very credible accusation of rape by Juanita Broaddrick.)</p> <p>But these multiple apologies were not good enough for Ryan. Apparently, Trump’s words are beyond forgiveness. So, Ryan snipped Trump’s brake lines, folded his arms, and is watching Trump’s sedan roll toward a precipice.</p> <p>Ryan should ask himself these questions, as should those who applaud his behavior this week:</p> <p>‐Is Trump’s “locker-room talk” so objectionable that Ryan would stand by and let Hillary Clinton win the White House?</p> <p>If so, then in exchange for having a president who does not use “the P word” (as far as we know), America would be at the mercy of a more liberal, pro-choice Supreme Court. Concurrently, a Hillary-led federal government would work tirelessly to provide tax dollars for thousands — perhaps hundreds of thousands — of abortions.</p> <p>To hell with Trump’s plans to turn the Hyde Amendment into an actual federal statute.</p> <p>Hillary wants to kill the Hyde Amendment. But at least she will avoid the P word.</p> <p>Ryan should ask himself: Which is worse, the sound of Trump on an 11-year-old tape or the silent screams of murdered unborn children whose numbers surely will climb under the militantly pro-abortion Hillary Clinton?</p> <p>‐ As the price for having a president who does not use the P word, Ryan seems willing to let a President Hillary Clinton keep America’s taxes high, complex, unreformed, and anti-competitive. The corporate tax rate would stay at 35 percent, as taxes overall climbed by $1.55 trillion.</p> <p>That would stick it to Trump, what with his P word, his 15 percent corporate tax rate, and his $4.4 trillion tax cut.</p> <p>‐ As payment for having a president who avoids the P word, Ryan would hang back and let the prime mover of the disastrous Iran nuclear deal protect it as president and continue Obama’s policy of appeasing and, even worse, subsidizing Tehran’s radical-Islamic terror state with air-freight deliveries of cash and gold totaling between $1.7 billion and $ <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3782488/Iran-collected-33-6-BILLION-nuclear-deal-Obama-administration-delivered-cash-shipments-unfroze-billions-more.html" type="external">33.6 billion</a>.</p> <p>Who needs Trump, his P word, and a tough stance on Iran — including scrapping or at least overhauling the Iran nuclear deal and its $150 billion in unfrozen assets?</p> <p>More federally subsidized abortions, more high taxes, and more goodies for the ayatollahs.</p> <p>#related#These awful things, and many more, would be the venomous spawn of a Hillary Clinton administration.</p> <p>Conversely, a President Trump likely would sign most legislation that a Republican Congress put on his desk. What an opportunity!</p> <p>Who, precisely, does Ryan think would sign any remotely pro-market reform that a GOP Congress sent to a President Hillary Clinton?</p> <p>This vital question seems trivial to Ryan.</p> <p>But — great news! — if Hillary Clinton were to be elected, America would have a president who does not use the P word. And as Paul Ryan would cheer, at least we would have that going for us.</p> <a type="internal">Deroy Murdock</a> — Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor and a contributing editor of National Review Online.</article>

(Reuters photo: Carlos Barria) <p>Hillary Clinton’s critics correctly warn that she could name one or more justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p> <p>But that would be just a start.</p> <p>As conservative activist <a href="http://www.conservativehq.com/node/24392" type="external">Richard Viguerie</a> has argued for years: “Personnel is policy.”</p> <p>A President Hillary Clinton would nominate hundreds of people to top positions that require Senate approval. She would hire hundreds of thousands of others and unleash them to perpetrate Hillaryism — a toxic blend of lies, elitist nannyism, secretive paranoia, and snarling contempt for the law. These people would enjoy police powers, fat salaries, mouth-watering benefits, and bullet-proof job security — at taxpayer expense.</p> <p>If Hillary nominated only one liberal jurist to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, she could nudge the Court to the left for decades. Free speech, religious liberty, gun rights, separation of powers, free enterprise, federalism, and unborn Americans all would be in the cross hairs.</p> <p>But her influence would go far, far beyond that.</p> <p>Other Supreme Court vacancies could arise, of course.</p> <p>Thirteen federal appeals-court seats are empty. So are 77 federal trial-court benches. Also, 14 other judges have announced their plans to retire between now and June 2017.</p> <p>All told, by next Independence Day, Hillary could name 105 like-minded judges to these federal courts.</p> <p>And that’s just the judicial branch.</p> <p>Hillary would nominate 15 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/cabinet" type="external">cabinet</a> secretaries who share her collectivist vision. The secretaries of state, treasury, labor, transportation, and others, in turn, would be encircled by platoons of undersecretaries, deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries, and their secretaries.</p> <p>The federal government includes “137 independent executive agencies with 268 components,” according to <a href="https://www.acus.gov/sites/default/files/documents/EXCERPT_ABA_Spring2013_final.pdf" type="external">USA.gov</a>. Hillary would employ the heads of these bodies, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Internal Revenue Service, and many, many more. Beyond that, ad hoc boards, commissions, and blue-ribbon panels also would clamor for chiefs.</p> <p>And then we have the Indians.</p> <p>Obama employed at least <a href="http://www.investors.com/politics/andrew-malcolm/americans-figure-out-public-employees-have-it-better-than-private-workers/" type="external">143,000</a> federal staffers during his first term, Investor’s Business Daily estimates. Hillary likely would hire as many federal workers in her image or merely leave thousands of Obamites in place and let them keep on keeping on.</p> <p>Neither prospect is appetizing.</p> <q> <p>As a devoted disciple of Saul Alinsky, Hillary understands the first of his twelve Rules for Radicals.</p> </q> <p>As a devoted disciple of Saul Alinsky, Hillary understands the first of his twelve <a href="http://www.bestofbeck.com/wp/activism/saul-alinskys-12-rules-for-radicals" type="external">Rules for Radicals</a>: “Power is derived from two main sources — money and people. ‘Have-Nots’ must build power from flesh and blood.” Thus, she would hire smart, focused, far-left lawyers, economists, inspectors, and administrators to enter the bureaucracy, burrow like termites, and slowly nibble away at what remains of this beautiful country.</p> <p>Thousands of young Rodhamites could infest America’s federal agencies and cause incalculable damage until they retire — 30 or 40 years hence.</p> <p>#share#The flip side of this threat is a yuuuuuge opportunity:</p> <p>A President Trump would nominate his own candidates for the Supreme Court and lower benches.

	<article id="0000867" published-at="2016-10-29" title="Just the Facts, Ma’am">
(Reuters photo: Carlos Barria) <p>Hillary Clinton’s cascading e-mail troubles are dragging her down ─ while issues are lifting Donald Trump up.</p> <p>We knew there could be a big October surprise before this bizarre and unpopular election finally came to an end. But who knew it would come from e-mails found on a device used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner that was confiscated by the FBI after he allegedly sexted an underage woman — an act that cost him his job, his income, and his marriage?</p> <p>As I pondered this on Friday afternoon, I had a faint recollection of Winston Churchill describing a tough loss in an MP election. Hat tip to Susan Varga, who located this Churchill gem: “In a twinkling of an eye, I found myself without an office, without a seat, without a party, and without an appendix.” Churchill had his appendix taken out during that election, which took place in 1922.</p> <p>So let’s see here. Anthony Weiner lost his office and his seat. And while I don’t know about his appendix, he did lose his marriage for referring to matters below the waist.</p> <p>And Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s aide and Weiner’s soon to be ex-wife, may well lose her seat and her office, although I couldn’t find any information about her appendix, despite a long Google search.</p> <p>On the other hand, the FBI’s bombshell that it is reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server may well cause the Democratic presidential candidate to lose her office, her seat, and her party. As to the condition of her appendix, we’ll just have to guess, since no one knows the state of her deteriorating health.</p> <p>And then we have FBI director James Comey, who may well be on his way to losing his office, his seat, and his reputation. (I have no information on the status of his appendix.)</p> <p>And how bizarrely ironic is it that Comey — who lost considerable credibility a couple of months ago for building an iron-clad case against Hillary and then letting her off the hook — is now reopening her case based not on Russian espionage or Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, but on Anthony Weiner’s electronic sex life?</p> <p>This will not bring honor and glory to J. Edgar Hoover’s venerable crime-fighting organization. Comey’s announcement, by the way, follows hot on the heels of the revelation that Clinton pal and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe channeled near $500,000 into the failed state senate campaign of Jill McCabe, who is the wife of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who helped oversee the agency’s investigation into Clinton’s private e-mail server. And let it be known that Hillary helped raise $1 million for McAuliffe’s PAC.</p> <p>Did any of these connections have anything to do with Hillary’s getting off scot free from a criminal indictment? Nah.</p> <p>But wait, could it be that Donald Trump’s accusation that the system is rigged is correct after all?</p> <p>Now, from Churchill to Jack Webb. Remember him? He played LAPD Detective Sergeant Joe Friday on the great Dragnet series. He opened the show with, “This is the city: Los Angeles, California. I work here. I’m a cop.”</p> <p>But the straight-shooting Detective Friday may be better known for this deadpan phrase: “Just the facts, ma’am.” Those are words that may go to the very heart of this presidential election.</p> <p>No matter what James Comey unveils in the days ahead, if anything, virtually no one in this country believes Hillary Clinton will ever divulge “just the facts.”</p> <p>#related#That’s what the polls say, and for her they’re getting worse. And that’s exactly what the FBI bombshell has reminded the voting public. Clinton, Inc., is dishonest, above the law, on the take.</p> <p>New WikiLeaks-provided e-mails from Clinton aide Doug Band reveal the true nature of the Clinton cash operation: No matter what the stated humanitarian goals of the Clinton Foundation, every fiber and sinew of the organization is wrapped in self-dealing, self-enrichment, fraud, and corruption.</p> <p>This is how the Clinton’s got rich. They traded cash for State Department visits and cash for government favors (like signing away 20 percent of American uranium reserves to oligarchic pals of Vladimir Putin). And let’s not forget those $450,000 speeches by Bill Clinton and those $250,000 speeches by Hillary herself.</p> <p>And she can’t even tell the truth about that, as leaked e-mails show that she said one thing to Wall Street and quite another to the public.</p> <p>The election is a week and a half away, and the atmosphere has changed significantly. In the last several days, at long last, Donald Trump has been talking issues on the campaign trail. Issues like the economy, tax cuts, the need to repeal and rewrite Obamacare, and even African American inner-city problems. During this period Hillary Clinton was deluged with e-mail leaks and blindsided by the FBI.</p> <p>Issues beat e-mail leaks. Polls are rapidly narrowing. Suddenly, the potential for a GOP three-house electoral sweep is growing larger.</p></article>
	<article id="0000869" published-at="2016-11-02" title="The Trials of Saint Hillary">
(Reuters photo: Brian Snyder) <p>Hillary Clinton’s e-mail scandal is about her corruption, not the FBI director’s anti-woman bias.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is perfect.</p> <p>That, apparently, is the Left’s new line on their nominee. It was one thing to label her a corrupt old crone when she was running against newfangled 1930s near-octogenarian Bernie Sanders. It was another thing to sigh over her foibles when she led Donald Trump by double digits.</p> <p>But in a close election, Democrats have decided to don the blinders: Hillary is a saint. And all who oppose her are angels of darkness.</p> <p>When Hillary’s e-mail scandal first cropped up, the Left acknowledged Hillary’s dicey relationship with the truth, but praised rival Bernie Sanders for his gentlemanly unwillingness to exploit Hillary’s corruption for political gain. Then, when Sanders finally shuffled off into the political sunset, they shifted their narrative: Now, Hillary was being targeted over speculation and innuendo — but she had some of that coming, given her decision to set up a private e-mail server. When the FBI effectively closed its original investigation, they could point to FBI director James Comey’s supposed rectitude as evidence for their theory that Hillary had made a mistake, but she hadn’t done anything criminal.</p> <p>Then, like a zombie rising from the dead, E-mailgate returned: twice as brutal, twice as ugly, and twice as unkillable.</p> <p>It’s too late in the election cycle to ward off E-mailgate with some tut-tutting or a wave of the hand. This election is too close for Democrats to simply acknowledge Hillary’s corruption, then vote for her in order to stop Trump.</p> <p>No, they must blind themselves to Hillary’s corruption utterly, and blind others to it as well. They must spray lye in the eyes of the public to protect Hillary’s lies. And so the Left have declared their new enemies: James Comey, and supposed sexism.</p> <p>Parodic New York Times columnist Charles Blow led the way with a column titled “ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/opinion/emails-genitalia-and-the-fbi.html" type="external">Emails, Genitalia and the FBI</a>.” Blow now alleges that the election is rigged — sound familiar? — by nefarious forces beyond Hillary’s control. “This election isn’t in danger of being stolen by Hillary Clinton,” Blow says, “but in danger of being stolen from her.” And why, pray tell, would James Comey, Hillary’s heretofore savior, turn on her like a Judas? Because, writes Blow, “this is just the latest lifeline being thrown to a Republican candidate drowning in his own ineptitude.” Comey must be working for the Trumps. Or the Russians. Or somebody.</p> <p>Senator Harry Reid (D., Nev.), a petrifying political cow dropping, has accused Comey, in full Joe McCarthy fashion, of the same malfeasance. “I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that [your] actions may violate the Hatch Act,” Reid wrote to Comey. “In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government#…#[but] you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.” Reid is now approximately five minutes from brandishing a list of Communists before the cameras, calling for Comey’s resignation.</p> <p>And Harry Reid isn’t the only one. Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake — a woman who once declared that she would let rioters destroy her city because it was imperative to give them “room” to express themselves — called Comey “reckless” and suggested that “he’s under pressure and he got shook.” Former attorney general Eric Holder, who is still under contempt of Congress, declared Comey’s actions absolutely deplorable.</p> <p>Most hilarious, Professor Robin Lakoff of the University of California, Berkeley, labeled the entire enterprise sexist. “ <a href="http://time.com/4551711/hillary-clinton-emailgate/" type="external">Emailgate</a> <a href="http://time.com/4551711/hillary-clinton-emailgate/" type="external">is a bitch hunt</a>,” she wrote at Time.com, “but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It’s us. The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man?”</p> <q> <p>Too many Republicans look at how Democrats rally around awful people ranging from Bill Clinton to Teddy Kennedy, and think, ‘How can we do that?’</p> </q> <p>Lakoff apparently forgot that this re-investigation exists only began because a man, Anthony Weiner, is under FBI investigation; she apparently forgot that General David Petraeus was punished for similar crimes; she apparently neglects that 91 percent of all prison inmates are men, and that virtually every political scandal in history has targeted a man. But never mind that: Hillary must be shielded, and if her genitalia will serve the cause, so be it!</p> <p>One of the most disappointing aspects of this election cycle has been the realization by some conservatives that many of our fellow conservatives want to be Democrats. They want to be Democrats not in terms of policy, although some Trump fans are indistinguishable from blue dog Democrats. They want to be Democrats in terms of politician-worship. Too many Republicans look at how Democrats rally around awful people ranging from Bill Clinton to Teddy Kennedy, and think, “How can we do that? If we just did that, we’d be able to elect more Republicans!”</p> <p>There’s truth to that. Obviously, Democrats are willing to stand with their candidates, even after those candidates use their interns as humidors or their female friends as car anchors. But that’s what distinguishes Republicans from Democrats historically. And even when Republicans begin to act like Democrats — when we begin to excuse the worst excesses of our candidates in the name of victory — it doesn’t work all that well. Many Republicans still agonize over the foibles and evils of Trump. Many Republicans won’t vote for him. The same doesn’t hold true for Democrats, who may pretend at skepticism but fall into pure godworship the moment the chips are down.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton isn’t a victim. She created a private server for her own benefit, and she’s been ensnared in her own paranoia and ambition. The fact that Democrats will cling to her sainthood despite that obvious truth demonstrates that Democrats cannot be trusted with power. To the extent that Republicans imitate Democrats, they can’t be trusted with power either.</p> <p>Yes, at long last, the Left has pulled its anti-Trump card: Hillary has a vagina, and is being targeted for that supposedly debilitating condition.</p> <p>The attempts to paint E-mailgate as sexism demonstrate the Left’s blindness to Hillary’s flaws. At least we acknowledge Trump’s faults in the GOP — or at least a major segment of us do. The Left’s attempts to pawn off all anti-Hillary scandals as effects of sexism (and Obama’s as effects of racism) are a basic avoidance maneuver.</p> <a type="internal">Ben Shapiro</a> — Ben Shapiro is the editor in chief of the Daily Wire. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/benshapiro" type="external">@benshapiro</a> <a type="internal">Photo Essays</a></article>

Hillary Clinton campaigns in Lake Worth, Fla., October 26, 2016. (Reuters photo: Carlos Barria) <p>As the presidential campaigns sink to the challenge of demonstrating that there is no such thing as rock bottom, remember this: When the Clintons decamped from Washington in January 2001, they took some White House furnishings that were public property. They also finished accepting more than $190,000 in gifts, including two coffee tables and two chairs, a $7,375 gratuity from Denise Rich, whose fugitive former husband had been pardoned in President Clinton’s final hours. A Washington Post editorial (“Count the Spoons”) identified “the Clintons’ defining characteristic: They have no capacity for embarrassment. Words like shabby and tawdry come to mind. They don’t begin to do it justice.”</p> <p>Today, Hillary Clinton strives to live again among some White House furnishings that she and her helpmeet were compelled to disgorge. Her campaign flounders because as secretary of state some of the nation’s business might have been melded with the contents of a computer that is pertinent to an FBI investigation of a former Democratic congressman’s alleged sexual texting with a female minor. Ransack the English language for words to do this justice.</p> <p>During the recent welter of reports about the Clintons’ self-dealing through their charity that has been very charitable to them, The New Yorker, reporting her plans to uplift the downtrodden, quoted her aspiration: “I want to really marry the public and the private sector.” This would solve the Clintons’ problem of discerning the line between public business and private aggrandizement: Erase the line.</p> <p>So, herewith America’s choice. Restore the House of Clinton. Or confer executive powers — powers that President Obama by his audacity, and Congress by its lethargy, have proven to be essentially unlimited — on another competitor in the sleaze sweepstakes, Donald Trump, who shares his opponent’s disinclination to disentangle the personal and the political.</p> <p>RELATED: <a type="internal">History Repeats: A Nixonian Cover-up in the Homestretch of the Campaign</a></p> <p>Into this political maelstrom, FBI director James Comey injected an announcement that intensified the chaos without providing a scintilla of news that voters can use: An unknown number of e-mails of unknown provenance and unknown content might be “pertinent” to an investigation that already has established, beyond peradventure, that Secretary Clinton was “extremely careless” with sensitive material.</p> <p>Add the FBI, and the Justice Department to which it belongs, to the carnage of institutions that is a byproduct of bad judgments by the political class that have voters asking Casey Stengel’s question. In 1962, Stengel, manager of the New York Mets, an expansion team en route to a record of 120 losses, looked down his dugout at his woebegone players and wondered aloud, “Can’t anybody here play this game?”</p> <p>It is grimly hilarious to hear it said that the Justice Department, by not holding Comey to established protocols concerning discussions of ongoing investigations, and concerning pronouncements close to elections, has tainted itself. Obamacare would not have passed if Justice Department lawyers had not conducted what a federal judge declared a corrupt prosecution of Alaska’s Republican senator Ted Stevens, costing him reelection. The department has enabled, by not seriously investigating, the IRS’s suppression of political advocacy by conservative groups. Or of the IRS’s subsequent destruction of subpoenaed e-mails pertinent to this. So, unsurprisingly, the most intrusive and potentially punitive federal agency continues to punish conservative groups for being conservative, according to Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer for political groups who confirms there are indeed conservative organizations who were targeted by the IRS and have still not received their tax-exempt status.</p> <p>In 2013, Barack Obama professed himself “angry” about “inexcusable” IRS behavior, before he decided there was not a “smidgen” of IRS corruption. He claimed to have learned about the IRS behavior from the media. Now he claims that he learned from the media about Clinton’s e-mail abuses, although they had exchanged e-mails using her private server. Perhaps.</p> <p>The defining scandal of the Obama era has been the media’s lackadaisical consensus that Obama’s administration has had no serious scandal. This, although with the Justice Department protecting the IRS, the administration has (in the words of Richard Nixon’s White House counsel John Dean) used “the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.”</p> <p>#related#Clinton, the ultimate author of her current agony, resembles no one so much as Nixon in her paranoia and joyless pursuit of joy. Her government career began with the House committee preparing Nixon’s impeachment. Twenty-two years earlier, he had saved his career by addressing a supposed scandal with his nationally broadcast “Checkers speech,” which was mawkish, abasing, and effective. How fitting it would be for a Clinton “Checkers speech” to end our long national nightmare that this campaign has been.</p></article>
	<article id="0000871" published-at="2017-12-27" title="Who Deserves Credit for the Trump Administration’s Accomplishments?">
President Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House in July. (Reuters photo: Joshua Roberts) <p>Contrary to what many predicted, President Trump’s end-of-year accomplishment list isn’t that skimpy.</p> <p>That’s an analytical observation. For many, particularly liberals and Democrats, Trump’s first year hasn’t been merely bad. It’s a great evil, a grievous wound to the American body politic.</p> <p>But even that is a kind of partisan tribute to what’s been accomplished on his watch: a record number of judicial appointments, including a Supreme Court justice; the defeat of Islamic State; repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate; tax reform; and major rollbacks of various regulations, from arctic drilling to net neutrality.</p> <p>It hasn’t exactly been smooth sailing. Trump is the most unpopular first-year president in American history, for reasons far beyond mere bad press.</p> <p>Still, among conservatives, the tally of “wins” has sparked some intramural debates. The most prominent one is how Trump skeptics and avowed Never Trumpers should respond to those wins. For writers such as the Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin and The Atlantic’s David Frum, the only legitimate response is either to ignore these successes or denigrate them, lest people lose sight of the threat Trump poses to the country. Others, including myself, argue instead that one needn’t deny the merits of a policy victory simply because the president might get credit for it.</p> <p>This debate skips over the larger question of whether these victories happened because of Trump or despite him.</p> <p>On one level, the president always gets the credit — or blame — for anything that happens on his watch. But Trump poses a challenge to such superficial scorekeeping. No president in American history has rejected Harry Truman’s “The buck stops here” motto as vehemently or consistently as this one. He never accepts responsibility for his own mistakes, never mind those of his administration or party. When American troops die, the commander in chief blames “the generals.” When legislation fails, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the “establishment” are at fault.</p> <p>Trump boosters agree. Conservative writer Roger Simon argues that all “remaining Never Trumpers” must apologize for being wrong about the president. He chalks up Trump’s “astoundingly successful” first year to the fact the president is a “quick study.”</p> <p>But what evidence is there that Trump has actually learned the art of presidential management?</p> <p>Aside from the mandatory flattery required of Republican elected officials, there’s remarkably little testimony that Trump has involved himself in the process of governing. Tax reform was carried across the finish line by the GOP congressional leadership. Net neutrality was repealed by independent Republicans at the Federal Communications Commission.</p> <p>Foreign policy is a more mixed bag. If the president deserves credit for the defeat of Islamic State, it’s because he let “the generals” do their thing. On the other hand, credit (or blame) for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris accord on climate change certainly goes to him.</p> <p>In general, it seems to me that Trump’s success (such as it is) is less attributable to sudden mastery of the issues than to staying out of the way of rank-and-file Republican policymakers, activists, and bureaucrats.</p> <p>For instance, the task of selecting judicial appointees, starting with Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, has largely been outsourced to the Federalist Society. When the president revealed his new national-security strategy last week, his speech — the usual campaign blather — had only a passing resemblance to the underlying document. The tax bill is clearly more in line with House Speaker Paul Ryan’s ideology than candidate Trump’s supposed populism. As for a counter-example: When Trump was “hands-on” with Obamacare repeal, he often revealed he didn’t even know what was in the legislation.</p> <p>In 2016, some conservatives argued that Republicans should vote as if we live in a parliamentary democracy, electing a party, not a person. Trump’s 3,000 political appointees would be better than Hillary Clinton’s. That argument had its flaws, not least that voters tend not to compartmentalize that way — which is why the GOP faces a potential bloodbath in the 2018 midterms.</p> <p>But there’s merit to it as well. To listen to Trump’s cheerleaders, the biggest obstacle to conservative victories is the party establishment, when in reality it looks more like it’s running the show.</p> <p>READ MORE:</p> <a type="internal">Jonah Goldberg</a> — Jonah Goldberg holds the Asness Chair in Applied Liberty at the American Enterprise Institute and is a senior editor of National Review.

But season tickets? For fark’s sake. Scalp them or put them on StubHub. If you can’t bear the thought of accepting compensation for ridding yourself of something so evil, donate the proceeds to a veterans’ group. Your Instagram video going viral can’t be worth as much to you as you paid for those seats.</p> <p>Although … now that I look more closely at the clip below, is it Colts tickets that the guy’s burning? In that case, yeah, light ’em up.</p> <a type="internal"/> Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? <p>I wonder if the president’s seen this video yet. It would cheer him up after last night’s humiliation in Alabama. The man <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/politics/trump-nascar-nfl-protests.html?mcubz=0" type="external">knows what he’s doing</a> with this NFL business:</p> <q> <p>But there was one part of the trip [to Alabama last week] that cheered him up, according to three people close to the president: rallygoers’ thunderous approval of his attack on Colin Kaepernick, a former N.F.L. quarterback, for kneeling in protest during the national anthem, a slam punctuated by an epithet-laced suggestion that team owners fire employees who disrespect patriotic tradition…</p> <p>In private, the president and his top aides freely admit that he is engaged in a culture war on behalf of his white, working-class base, a New York billionaire waging war against “politically correct” coastal elites on behalf of his supporters in the South and in the Midwest. He believes the war was foisted upon him by former President Barack Obama and other Democrats — and he is determined to win, current and former aides said.</p> </q> <p>Is he winning the culture war over the NFL? Well, per <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-nfl-poll/a-majority-of-adults-disagree-with-trump-on-firing-athletes-who-kneel-during-anthem-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1C1304" type="external">Reuters</a>, 58 percent agree with him that pro athletes should be required to stand for the anthem and 37 percent, including 67 percent of Republicans, say they’ve become less favorable to the NFL. The share that say they support the stance taken by Colin Kaepernick and other kneeling players is up 12 points from last year, though, from 28 percent then to 40 now. Trump’s entry into this debate is probably polarizing it along partisan lines; we may end up with less consensus now over anthem protests than we had before purely because Democrats are so reluctant to back him on a cultural hot-button. Also, when you ask if players should be *fired* for refusing to stand, the majority shifts: 57 percent say no, including 29 percent of Republicans, while 53 percent think that the president shouldn’t be comment publicly on how the NFL and its players act during the anthem. It’s safe to say the public supports POTUS in wanting players to stand, they just don’t agree that there should be a penalty for dissent.</p> <p>This result is interesting too. The columns, from left to right, represent overall public opinion, Democrats, Republicans, and independents:</p> <p>One criticism leveled at the protests is that public anger is not just about the anthem, it’s about employees dragging their politics into their place of business. Average Americans would never be allowed to get away with that. If this is accurate, though, a plurality are okay with athletes mixing politics with sports. It depends on the politics, of course, and on avoiding disrespect to the flag.</p> <p>Mo Brooks said yesterday that the feds could bite back at the NFL for not disciplining players who refuse to stand for the anthem by <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/352648-rep-mo-brooks-we-should-terminate-federal-government-support-to-nfl" type="external">halting advertising for the armed forces during games</a>. The Pentagon might not be keen on that — there aren’t a ton of opportunities on TV to reliably reach a mostly male audience, and jeopardizing recruitment isn’t an obvious move to make when you’re otherwise busy yelling at Kaepernick for supposedly insulting the military. But it is a point of leverage, as are the lucrative subsidies teams receive from state and local governments for stadiums. I wonder how that would fare in court. Government normally can cut funding for basically any reason but not quite every reason. A court would have something to say, I assume, if Congress cut funds to a state for a nakedly bigoted purpose, e.g., because it had a large percentage of minorities. Courts have been more aggressive in the Trump era in scrutinizing the motives behind policies too, most famously in the case of the travel ban where federal judges looked at POTUS’s comments about Muslims as a candidate to find that the ban violates equal protection. If the Pentagon cut funds to the NFL over anthem protests and the league sued on grounds of viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment, how would that case go? Straightforward matter of government not being required to subsidize speech with which it disagrees or would some judge reach to find a constitutionally impermissible motive?</p> <q> <p>NFL​ fans burn season tickets and team paraphernalia in response to football players taking a knee to protest. <a href="https://t.co/Ec5CRF7TZu" type="external">https://t.co/Ec5CRF7TZu</a> <a href="https://t.co/fUKQX4chHX" type="external">pic.twitter.com/fUKQX4chHX</a></p> <p>— ABC News (@ABC) <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC/status/912710883087810560" type="external">September 26, 2017</a></p> </q></article>

Jim Jordan, the Republican Chairman Emeritus of the Freedom Caucus, who strenuously defended the move. However, Cuomo was equally passionate while arguing that Trump is torpedoing Obamacare in an effort to prove that Obama’s signature policy is a disaster to America. Yet Jordan believes that Trump is simply ending payments to insurance companies that the Justice Department considers <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-cuomo-challenges-jim-jordan-on-trumps-acting-like-an-emperor-executive-orders/" type="external">“unconstitutional.”</a></p> <p>The above clip begins after Cuomo <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-cuomo-challenges-jim-jordan-on-trumps-acting-like-an-emperor-executive-orders/" type="external">calls Trump an “emperor”</a> for relying upon executive orders every time Congress doesn’t succeed at passing his agendas. Cuomo also argued that there’s no conceivable way that removing these subsidies would be beneficial for low-income Americans:</p> <q> <p>“You cannot find a reasonable health care analyst who will look at cutting the subsidies, shrinking the enrollment period, and doing other things that the president’s doing in his executive order and what you’re trying to do in your bill, that makes it better for American families””</p> </q> <p>Further, Cuomo accused Republicans of allowing Trump to intentionally destroy Obama care while “doing it on the backs of the most needy.” Jordan argued, “You can’t stabilize this thing, it’s already falling apart.” To which Cuomo countered, “You’re making it fall apart!”</p> <p>Trump’s removal of subsidies is projected to substantially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order-health-insurance.html" type="external">elevate insurance premiums</a> and <a href="https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/slides-4-6-17-web-briefing-for-journalists-cost-sharing-subsidies.pdf" type="external">increase deductibles</a> for families and individuals near the poverty line.

Getty Image <p>Apparently size does matter — IQ size, that is. President Trump challenged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson <a type="internal">to an IQ test</a> after hearing in a news report that Tillerson might have called the POTUS a “moron.” If Trump wants to put the proverbial money where his mouth is, Mensa, the elite society for those with ultra-high IQs, has indicated they can make that test happen.</p> <p>“American Mensa would be happy to hold a testing session for President Trump and Secretary Tillerson,” <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/354718-mensa-offers-to-host-iq-test-for-trump-and-tillerson" type="external">said Mensa communications director</a> Charles Brown. That’s an offer of more than just an IQ test — Mensa offers admission only to those who rank in the top 2% of test scores. Brown wouldn’t say one way or the other if any high-profile politicians in Trump and Tillerson’s league are already members of the intelligence society.</p> <p>The matter began after an MSNBC report cited three anonymous sources who claim <a type="internal">Tillerson called Trump a “moron”</a> during a July meeting. Tillerson brushed the article aside as “ <a type="internal">petty nonsense</a>,” but Trump hasn’t gotten over the alleged slight since the story broke. He tweeted that MSNBC is “fake news” and accused them of <a type="internal">having low ratings</a>, as if to agree with Tillerson that the “moron” comment is untrue.</p> <p>Maybe he’s just riled up that <a type="internal">Tillerson is grabbing headlines</a>. Either way, by attacking MSNBC and challenging his Secretary of State to an IQ contest, Trump has tacitly admitted that even a hypothetical insult to his intelligence has him hot under the collar. Still, this IQ showdown has shades of the familiar. After all, this is a President who has wrung his hands over the <a type="internal">size of his inauguration crowd</a> and boasted over the hugeness of his ratings versus those of his “failing” critics.

What’s more, the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at risk.</p> <p>The Chinese food production industry is one of the world’s least-regulated and most corrupt, as has repeatedly been proven time and again. Now, it appears, there is no trusting anything that comes from China marked “organic.”</p> <p>U.S. Customs personnel often turn away food shipments from China because they contain unsavory <a type="internal">additives</a>and drug residues, are mislabeled, or are just generally filthy. Some Chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products “organic,” though they are far from it.</p> <p>There are several factors at play which make Chinese claims of organic unreliable. First, environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted <a type="internal">soil</a>and waterways with <a href="http://foodforensics.com/" type="external">toxic heavy metals</a> that nothing grown in them is safe, much less organic. Also, there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that it’s not smart to trust what is put on packaging.</p> <p>In fact, farmers in China use water that is replete with heavy metals, Natural Health 365 noted in <a href="http://www.naturalhealth365.com/china_fraud-html.html/" type="external">a separate report</a>. In addition, water used for irrigation also contains <a type="internal">organic</a>and inorganic substances and <a type="internal">pollutants</a>. Chinese “organic” food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it.</p> ‘Dirty water’ is all there is <p>The report noted further:</p> <q> <p>“This is reality – all of China’s grains, <a type="internal">vegetables</a>and fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater. The Yellow River, which is considered unusable, supports major <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/food.html" type="external">food</a> producing areas in the northeast provinces.”</p> </q> <p>Many Chinese farmers won’t even eat the food they produce, if you can believe that. That’s because it’s clear that China’s water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the country’s entire <a href="http://gardentower.naturalnews.com/GardenTower.html" type="external">food supply</a>.</p> <p>Chinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except “ <a href="http://www.cleanwater.news/" type="external">dirty water</a>.” As part of the country’s industrial prowess, it is also one of the largest producers (and consumers) of fertilizers and <a type="internal">pesticides</a>, <a href="http://www.waterpolitics.com/2013/01/20/the-thirsty-dragon-across-much-of-china-huge-harvests-irrigated-with-industrial-and-agricultural-runoff/" type="external">Water Politics</a> reported.</p> <p>The site noted further that as China’s industrial might grows, so too does the level of contaminants in the country’s water supply. Lakes, rivers, streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the year.</p> <p>In addition to man-made pollutants, animals produce about 90 percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in China’s <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/water.html" type="external">water</a>, say experts at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning. There are times when water is so polluted it turns black – yet it is still used to irrigate crops, and of course, that affects <a href="http://www.organicfarming.news/" type="external">so-called organic farming operations</a> as well.</p> <p>These nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted, Natural Health 365 noted:</p> <p>Fish:</p> <p>Some 80 percent of the <a type="internal">tilapia</a>sold in the U.S. come from fish farms in <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/China.html" type="external">China</a>, as well as half the cod.

Make sure you check out the next page to get to know the <a type="internal">10 simple moves</a> that will bring vitality back into your life!</p> To begin, I apologize for the dark nature of today's email. <p>However I promise what you'll discover today will be completely worth it.</p> <p>Imagine a rotting corpse draped over your body from head to toe...</p> <p>...suffocating tissue, restricting blood flow, damaging joints and infecting your healthy cells.</p> <p>Shockingly, that nightmare is a reality for most:</p> <p>64% of women and 74% of men carry too much body fat according to the National Institutes of Health.</p> <p>It's choking their organs, assaulting their metabolism and sucking their energy dry.</p> <p>But here's the worst part:</p> <p>For most, this bodyfat has become "calorie-resistant":</p> <p>It's completely unaffected by even the strictest diets... and most intense exercises.</p> <p>This zombie fat is essentially... "dead tissue".</p> <p>That's important for those who have 10, 25 or 50 or more pounds to lose...</p> <p>AND for those who aren't technically overweight, but have what's called "pocket obesity"...</p> <p>...unsightly patches of fat that cling to specific places, like:</p> <p>just above your hips, lower belly, where your butt and legs meet... and even arms, neck and face.</p> <p>However, there's good news:</p> <p>Obesity researchers have now discovered a "metabolic jumper cable":</p> <p>It jolts dead bodyfat back to life.</p> <p>This allows your metabolism to burn it as calories and re-energize your entire body.</p> <p>First though, here's the #1 reason why bodyfat becomes calorie-resistant:</p> <p>It lacks blood flow. This has 3 effects:</p> Not enough oxygen or nutrients reach fat cells, so they become unresponsive.. Released fat can't be sent to other tissues to be burned, so fat cells suck it back in... 3) Metabolic hormones carrying the "burn calories" message don't reach the fat cell... <p>All this means one thing:</p> <p>Your body can't transform into energy, the 135,000+ of calories the average person stores as fat!</p> <p>You become a metabolic zombie: NO energy to think. NO energy to move. NO energy to motivate.</p> <p>Update: calorie-resistant bodyfat can be now removed...</p> <p>The discovery of this "metabolic jumper cable" can now reverse this process:</p> It wakes up un-responsive bodyfat with a powerful calorie-burning hormonal jolt.... It pops open fat cells, sucks out the fat, sending it off before its yanked back in... It shuttles fat to your brain, heart, lungs, <a type="internal">kidneys</a> - even your bones - to be burned as energy. <p>Not only do those layers of "zombie fat" start coming off, but your entire body just works better.</p> <p>Plus, as your whole body burns more calories, those patches of pocket obesity whittle away.</p> <p>This "metabolic jumper cable" isn't any exercise, machine or pill.</p> <p>It's a little-known, calorie-burning hormone we all have... just waiting for the right spark to come alive.</p> <p>It's not <a type="internal">thyroid</a>, leptin, ghrelin, insulin, adiponectin, HGH or any other "fat loss" hormone you may know.</p> <p>And on <a type="internal">this next page</a>, you'll find out precisely how to unleash its calorie-burning power:</p> <p>PS - Studies show that not only can healthy levels of this powerful calorie-burning hormone devour bodyfat and fortify soft muscle, but it can also reduce your risk of diabetes by 53.7%, a heart attack by 83.3% and stroke by 51.4%. <a type="internal">Here's more of the scientific proof...</a></p> <a type="internal"/> <p>In April, 2009, researchers stunned the medical community when they reported chronic inflammation as the root cause of several major diseases.</p> <p>See, every year 610,000 people in the U.S. die of heart disease. <a type="internal">Cancer</a> claims another 584,000...stroke 130,000...Alzheimer's disease nearly 85,000 — and the list goes on.</p> <p>Truth is, we now know... chronic inflammation is responsible for 7 out of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States! Hundreds of studies and scientific reviews prove it.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Fortunately, newer research shows you can prevent-even reverse-most major diseases by "turning off" inflammation. And in our new book, we show you how to do just that.</p> <p>If you or a loved one is suffering from a debilitating condition-and you"re not sure what the culprit is-now's the time to find out...while you can still do something about it!</p> <p>--&amp;gt; <a type="internal">Grab your FREE copy of this groundbreaking soft cover book today</a> (while supplies still last.)</p> <p>If you haven't heard of Claude Davis yet do yourself a huge favor and <a type="internal">watch this video</a>.

You will automatically eat less without even noticing.</p> <p>Then start detoxing your body with tasty, nourishing smoothies that are just as easy on your wallet as they are easy to make.</p> <p>Because a single day of enjoying Liz’ smoothies demonstrated the radical power of her superfood-packed red smoothies to make me feel incredibly good.</p> <p>Now prepare yourself for one of the biggest weight loss secrets there is. A secret that, when you use it properly, can transform your body and your health.</p> <p>You probably know most of us eat too much processed food. What you may not know is that it’s full of toxic chemicals and substandard, dirt-cheap ingredients designed to make you eat more…and force you to gain weight.</p> <p>Here’s how it works.</p> <p>“That stuff is just a lot of calories your body can’t use,” Liz told me, “Some are poison. And all these foods are stripped of the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that help your body detox. The result? Your body expends huge amounts of calories to eliminate some toxins—the rest, it stores in your fat to protect you. This is why most people are hungry all the time. They’re not getting energy they need.”</p> <p>“So… what’s going on with me? Why am I losing weight but not going hungry?”</p> <p>Liz paused, then dropped the bombshell.</p> <p>Your body is designed to burn fat. You just have to let it.</p> <p>“What? I thought we were designed to store fat?!?” We were Skyping and I was practically shouting. Then I heard Liz say…</p> <p>What good is a fat reserve if you can’t burn it?</p> <p>Mind blown.</p> <p>Liz continued: “You’re drinking smoothies packed with phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that pull toxins out of you like a tractor beam. Allowing your body to burn those toxin-filled fat stores… and releasing tremendous amounts of stored energy.”</p> <p>So that’s why I’m losing weight without going hungry.</p> <p>Watch Liz’ free presentation. It’s packed with revolutionary weight loss information—information that works. Because it’s based on how nature.</p> <p>Click the button only if you want to wear smaller clothes, breathe easier, move more freely and just plain feel better.</p> <p><a type="internal">Because when you click here to watch Liz’ life-changing presentation</a>, you’ll learn</p> Which calories help you lose weight…and which ones help you gain it… The “diet” foods…some of them vegetables…that lead to weight gain and diabetes… And the superfoods that rescue your body from this assault by detoxing you… <p>Revitalizing your metabolism so you can Shed pounds as well as toxins, renew your body and reset your internal clock by up to 7 years.</p> <p>Because until now, the Red Smoothie Detox Factor has been available only to Liz’ private clients.

	<article id="0000880" published-at="2017-11-29" title="New York Times Magazine's Profile of Sean Hannity Missed a Ton of His Conspiracy Theories">
Photo Credit: screenshot /YouTube <p>Toward the end of his 8,000-word New York Times Magazine <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/magazine/how-far-will-sean-hannity-go.html" type="external">profile</a> of Sean Hannity -- after touching on image-softening tidbits like how the Fox News host and talk radio host who was once fired for <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2014/01/15/flashback-the-repulsive-anti-gay-comments-that/197597" type="external">homophobic vitriol</a> says he now has “gay friends” and the revelation that Hannity may have come to believe some of the women who say they were sexually harassed by Roger Ailes after trashing them publicly -- contributing writer Matthew Shaer considered the question of whether it’s possible the conservative media megastar and close adviser to President Donald Trump is actually a paranoid conspiracy theorist.</p> <p>“The problem for Fox News,” Shaer wrote, “is that while Hannity has risen to become the top ratings-earner of the nightly lineup, he is also a figure prone to barreling headfirst into the murky territory between opinion and out-and-out conspiracy theorism.” After highlighting a Vox.com <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/11/15/16649292/hannity-conspiracy-theorist-transcript-data" type="external">study</a> that found Hannity to be the “media’s top conspiracy theorist” and quoting Hannity rejecting that finding, Shaer appeared to agree with the host.</p> <p>“[T]o watch Hannity regularly is to observe how distant the host is from a figure like the Infowars proprietor Alex Jones,” Shaer concluded. “Jones endorses theories; Hannity almost never does, leaving that job to his guests. It is a dance that has the effect of nourishing the more wild-eyed beliefs of his fans while providing Hannity a degree of plausible deniability.”</p> <p>This is not a conclusion that can survive the slightest scrutiny from a regular observer of Hannity’s work. In fact, it is belied by the profile, which depicted Hannity promoting at least three conspiracy theories: that President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2011/03/28/hannity-wages-all-out-campaign-to-promote-birth/178035" type="external">needed to release</a> his birth certificate to prove he was born in the United States, that Hillary Clinton <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/11/09/study-fox-spent-nearly-12-hours-pushing-uranium-one-pseudoscandal-over-last-three-weeks/218475#hannity" type="external">pushed through</a> the purchase of a uranium mining company by Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation, and that a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/05/30/how-sean-hannity-became-champion-seth-rich-conspiracy-theory/216684" type="external">may have been killed</a>because he supposedly gave the group’s emails to WikiLeaks. Those are only a handful of the <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2017/05/31/mind-control-shadow-government-and-seth-rich-sean-hannity-s-history-pushing-conspiracy-theories/216718" type="external">numerous conspiracies and hoaxes</a> Hannity <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/08/17/sean-hannity-has-been-dumpster-diving-conspiracy-theorists-again/217686" type="external">has</a> <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/05/hannity-repeats-las-vegas-conspiracy-theory-gateway-pundit/218152" type="external">pushed</a> on his radio and television programs over the years.</p> <p>In fact, Hannity’s entire oeuvre for much of the Trump presidency has been built around a massive, all-encompassing conspiracy theory: That a <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/11/study-sean-hannity-and-five-forces-he-says-are-trying-destroy-trump/218192" type="external">“Destroy Trump Alliance”</a> composed of the press, the “deep state,” and critics from both major political parties have united in a coordinated effort to remove the president from office <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/09/study-hannity-s-treatment-trumps-russia-scandal-takes-authoritarian-turn/218177" type="external">based on what the Fox host deems</a> a “black-helicopter, tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories about so-called Trump-Russia collusion.” Hannity has detailed this theory in dozens of shows, warning against the depredations of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/11/22/16692190/strikethrough-trump-sean-hannity-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones" type="external">“deep state”</a> and the <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/09/study-hannity-s-treatment-trumps-russia-scandal-takes-authoritarian-turn/218177#russia" type="external">“deeply corrupt”</a> <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/08/04/22-ways-Sean-Hannity-has-tried-to-undermine-the-Russia-probes/217516" type="external">investigation</a> by special counsel Robert Mueller.</p> <p>On one occasion, Hannity <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2017/06/20/sean-hannity-soft-coup-underway-against-trump-sinister-forces-quickly-aligning/216982" type="external">described</a> the nefarious plot as a “soft coup” which he claimed constitutes a “clear and present danger.” If that sounds to you like Hannity endorsing a conspiracy theory, you aren’t alone; The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/06/21/fox-newss-sean-hannity-is-encroaching-on-alex-jones-territory/?utm_term=.75771165c57a" type="external">described</a> Hannity’s “soft coup” claim as the Fox host “encroaching on Alex Jones territory.”</p> <p>Hannity’s conspiracy theory has several key benefits: It allows Hannity to delegitimize any possible sources of negative information about the Trump administration by tying them into the plot; it encourages his viewers to stick with the president because he is beset by such malicious foes; and, perhaps most importantly, it allows Hannity to shift attention from the possible malfeasance Mueller may discover in his investigation to the question of whether Mueller himself is a criminal running an illegitimate probe <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/11/21/study-how-sean-hannity-trying-discredit-mueller-and-russia-probe/218611" type="external">who must step down or be fired</a> , as the Fox host has demanded dozens of times.</p> <p>The Times appears to have missed all this. Indeed, for someone claiming to be steeped in Hannity’s work, Shaer appears to have largely ignored Hannity’s discussion of the Russia investigation, perhaps the most important story of the year. The profile does not mention Mueller at all, and references Russia only a handful of times. A few of the dots are there -- the Times writer mentions, for instance, that Hannity’s Seth Rich theory was intended to undermine the case for Russia’s role in hacking the DNC to bolster Trump, and that Hannity views the Uranium One conspiracy as a way to “boomerang” the Russia investigation on Democrats -- he just doesn’t quite pull them together. And given how wild Hannity’s claims have become -- and the potential results they might have if his most powerful fan were to act on him -- that’s a big miss.</p> <p><a type="internal">Report Advertisement</a></p> <p>Take last night’s edition of Hannity. Monday morning, ABC News <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-flynns-lawyer-meets-members-special-counsels-team/story?id=51412187" type="external">reported</a> that the lawyer for Michael Flynn, who served as Trump’s national security adviser until he was forced from office following revelations about his conversations with Russian officials, had met with members of Mueller’s team, potentially to discuss a plea deal which might include Flynn testifying against the president or top White House aides. Mueller reportedly has amassed enough evidence to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/amp/mueller-has-enough-evidence-bring-charges-flynn-investigation-n817666" type="external">charge Flynn</a> with federal crimes, and Flynn’s <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/mike-flynn-mueller-probe-witness" type="external">role in several key interactions</a>involving Trump associates and Russia could make him an invaluable witness.</p> <p>But if you were one of the 3-million-plus viewers to turn in to Hannity’s show last night -- perhaps including the president -- you saw him assemble a case aimed at encouraging the audience to disbelieve anything Flynn might say following a plea deal, and instead direct their fire at Mueller’s team. Or, as Fox judicial analyst Gregg Jarrett, a Hannity <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/09/study-hannity-s-treatment-trumps-russia-scandal-takes-authoritarian-turn/218177#russia" type="external">regular</a>, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/embed/clips/2017/11/28/57240/fnc-hannity-20171127-panel" type="external">described</a> them, a “cartel, the equivalent of the Mob” composed of former FBI director James Comey, Mueller, and his team, an “illegal syndicate that’s acting under the guise of the law.” Contra Shaer, Hannity did not just stand by while his guests push conspiracy theories about how Mueller might suborn perjury from Flynn against Trump, he actively participated in constructing them:</p> <q> <p>SEAN HANNITY: How could this happen in the United States of America, Gregg? This is not a banana republic here.</p> <p>GREGG JARRETT: Because the Department of Justice, and particularly the FBI and Comey and Mueller at the FBI, have turned into this renegade rogue deep state that operates under their own rules.</p> <p>HANNITY: Do they really -- they don't want Manafort. They don't want General Flynn. They want Trump.</p> <a type="internal">Report Advertisement</a> <p>JARRETT: Yes. And what I worry about are ruthless prosecutors who suborn perjury. What they do is they make promises and threats to defendants. You’re gonna spend 10 years behind bars unless you sign this statement and the witness says, “but that's a lie,” and the prosecutor doesn't seem to care.</p> <p>HANNITY: Or I’m gonna go after your son.</p> <p>JARRETT: It's extortion. It's bribery. When they do it it's legal. When you and I do it it's illegal. It's got to stop.</p> </q> <p>That’s the message going out to Hannity's millions of viewers, perhaps including the president: Trump is being persecuted by an illegal cartel that will do anything and lie to anyone to force the innocent Trump from office. The only plausible deniability Hannity has is that which people like Shaer are willing to grant to him.</p> <p>As for how different Hannity’s show is from Jones’, the nation’s leading 9-11 truther <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/23/sean-hannity-has-really-gone-rails-lately-its-earned-him-new-fan-alex-jones/218270" type="external">has weighed in on the subject</a>. “Sean Hannity is currently the main leader of the resistance against the globalists outside of Trump and then of course myself,” Jones declared in June. “The Sean Hannity Show, he added in August, “is now The Alex Jones Show.”</p> <a href="http://www.alternetsurveys.org/survey-is-omarosa-telling-the-truth-about-trump/" type="external"/> Matt Gertz is a Senior Fellow</article>
	<article id="0000881" published-at="2017-07-22" title="Politics — not as dirty as you think"><p>The success of a marriage nearly always depends on the expectations of the parties going in. If you believe marriage is going to be a rose garden of happy trips to the beach interspersed with moonlight dinners and foot massages, you're more likely to end up cheating on your spouse when that doesn't materialize. If you believe marriage is a mechanism for changing your potential spouse, you likely are to end up estranged. If you believe marriage is about a lifelong union devoted to self-improvement and the creation and rearing of children, you likely are to make decisions that lead to that outcome.</p> <p>Americans don't trust politicians. That's for good reason. Politicians fib to get elected; they pander to particular constituencies; they leave principle at the door in favor of convenience in order to maintain power and position. But they do not, at least not that often, murder people and collude with foreign governments.</p> <p>But thanks to popular culture, that's exactly what many Americans think politicians do. If you watch "House of Cards," you likely are to believe top-level politicians "off" each other on a regular basis — and you might be more willing to believe conspiracy theories about the murder of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. If you've seen "The Manchurian Candidate," you're more likely to believe either former President Obama or President Trump is one.</p> <p>President Trump, who was a layman until he became president, obviously believes a lot of the pop culture mythology surrounding politics. That's why he told Bill O'Reilly it's not that big of a deal Russian President Vladimir Putin kills his political opponents.</p> <p>"You think our country's so innocent?" he said in jaw-dropping fashion.</p> <p>That's why Trump believes politics is such a "dirty business" — dirtier, even, than Manhattan real estate, where Trump worked with mafia figures. Politics, in Trump's mind, is the lowest of the low.</p> <p>That means a more corrupt administration. If you believe, as Trump assuredly does, anyone would take a meeting with Russian government figures to dig up dirt on an opponent, then you'll do it, too. Why be martyred just because you were too holy to get down in the mud? If you think Hillary Clinton is the way politics is done — we shouldn't be outraged because she's just another politician — then why not play by the same rules?</p> <p>Voters like to believe, as Trump does, politics is filthy because we refuse to acknowledge, in a representative republic, we're the ultimate sources of blame. We keep electing these moral idiots. We keep voting for them, demanding they give us things and suggesting they've "sold out" if they don't. We're the ones who decry crony capitalism while complaining the local factory will leave unless the government "does something."</p> <p>Politicians like to believe, as Trump does, politics is sordid because that's a tailor-made excuse for participating in bad behavior.

Our belief politics is a squalid affair finds realization in our politicians, who reflect that view, and in ourselves as we vote for those politicians.

	<article id="0000882" published-at="2017-05-14" title="A canceled cruise to Cuba cost this couple hundreds of dollars"><p>A cruise to Cuba is a dream for many people, but there are specific rules that a company must follow and a special certification it needs to run a cruise. When Pamela Gillet booked her dream cruise to Cuba with Pearl Seas Cruises, she assumed the company had secured permission to run the trip it sold her.</p> <p>We consistently advise our readers to do their research, but in this case Gillet needed to go beyond the terms and conditions for the cruise line. She needed to know whether the company had complied with U.S. law. The fact that she didn’t cost her $528. Can we help her get it back?</p> <p>Three weeks prior to her scheduled embarkation date, Gillet had not received final documents, so she called Pearl Seas Cruises. She was told that one cruise had already been canceled, and a second one would also be canceled. The company admitted that it had not received the required certification to sail, but couldn’t tell Gillet for certain if her cruise would sail.</p> <p><a href="http://TravelInsurance.com" type="external">TravelInsurance.com</a> makes it fast and easy to compare and buy travel insurance online from top rated providers. Our unbiased comparison engine allows travelers to read reviews, compare pricing and benefits and buy the right policy with a price guarantee, every time. Compare and buy travel insurance now at <a href="https://www.travelinsurance.com/" type="external">TravelInsurance.com</a>.</p> <p>One week prior to the embarkation date, Gillet was finally given the bad news: The cruise had been canceled. The company refunded the full amount that Gillet paid for the cruise, but then she requested a refund on the amount she paid for a nonrefundable hotel stay one night before the cruise embarked and nonrefundable flights to Ft. Lauderdale.</p> <p>Approximately 90 days after she requested a refund of these costs, Pearl Seas Cruises told her that her request was “still under consideration.” While we don’t specifically list contact information for Pearl Seas Cruises (our research team is on it, though), Gillet says she knew that Pearl Seas is owned by <a href="http://elliott.org/company-contacts/american-cruise-lines-inc/" type="external">American Cruise Lines</a>, and we do list its contact information on our website. I’m not sure ACL would have helped her either, but it might have been worth a try.</p> <p>What might have helped Gillet was researching the company with which she planned to travel, to determine if it had the authority to operate the trips. Travel to Cuba has been problematic for decades. It’s the only country to which U.S. citizens are banned from traveling — even travel to North Korea isn’t currently banned.</p> <p>Travel to Cuba and the prohibition of financial and commercial transactions by U.S. citizens was enacted in 1963 under President Kennedy. The travel ban was lifted in 2009 when President Obama lifted restrictions for Cuban-Americans, allowing them to visit relatives and provide financial support to their families in Cuba. Americans of non-Cuban descent were still generally prohibited from traveling to the island neighbor.</p> <p>In January 2011, what is now known as the “people-to-people” travel rules were enacted, expanding the categories of people who were allowed to travel to Cuba to include U.S. citizens pursuing “purposeful travel,” including academics, religious groups, students and charities. At this time, most travel to Cuba was through affinity organizations like alumni associations, as well as through churches or cultural groups.</p> <p>After the “diplomatic thaw” near the end of 2014, travel rules became even more relaxed, allowing Americans to travel to Cuba. In March 2015, MasterCard became the first company to unblock credit card use in Cuba, and later that month the first direct U.S.-Cuba charter flight was operated by Sun Country Airlines. Airbnb began listing rentals around Cuba the following month.</p> <p>Although travel restrictions have clearly relaxed, operating tours to Cuba still requires a People-to-People license. Unlike the other 11 categories of authorized travel to Cuba, the People-to-People license allows any American to legally travel to Cuba, as long as they have a full schedule of activities that enhance contact with Cuban citizens and result in “meaningful interaction” between American and Cuban citizens.</p> <p>The Pearl Seas Cruises website is clear that its voyages are subject to obtaining the required permissions on its <a href="http://www.pearlseascruises.com/general/" type="external">General Information</a> page:</p> <q> <p>Operation of the planned voyages is subject to obtaining all necessary approvals, permits and licenses from the governments of the U.S. and Cuba. All passengers must comply with U.S. and Cuban laws and regulations related to travel to Cuba.</p> </q> <p>Cruise companies plan their cruise far in advance because travelers book their travel far in advance. It is common that not all licenses have been granted at the time a cruise is planned and sold, and that’s likely one of many reasons that cruise lines include this clause in their <a href="http://www.pearlseascruises.com/terms/" type="external">terms and conditions</a>:</p> <q> <p>PSC reserves the right to change, cancel or substitute any itinerary, vessel, port of call, schedule, tour, excursion or duration of voyage at any time and for any reason whatsoever without prior notice (including reducing or extending days of voyage or continuing or finishing a voyage via other means of transportation) and shall not be liable for any claim whatsoever by Passenger for such change, including, but not limited to, loss, compensation, or refund; except Passenger shall be entitled to (i) a pro rata refund, calculated on a per day basis, of fare actually paid less applicable fees and charges, if a Cruise is cancelled or terminates early, and (ii) a refund of deposit actually paid to PSC for a tour or excursion, if that tour or excursion is cancelled.</p> </q> <p>Gillet claims that the Pearl Seas Cruises representative recommended arriving one day before the cruise embarkation date, which is good advice — if your flight is delayed and you miss embarkation you may have to either spend more money to get yourself to the next port or cancel your cruise with no refund.</p> <p>Pearl Seas Cruises offers to book hotel nights and air for their guests, and had Gillet booked her overnight and air through the cruise line, the company likely would have immediately refunded her in full — or at least offered a credit on a future cruise, when it finally received authorization to operate travel to Cuba. The other option would have been to book refundable air tickets, but most canceled air tickets retain their value for one year after the booking date.</p> <p>Gillet contacted us in an effort to recover the $528 she lost on her nonrefundable hotel room and air tickets. We contacted Pearl Seas Cruises multiple times on her behalf, but it ignored us. It did eventually offer Gillet a $528 credit on another Cuba cruise in 2017, but it took so long for the company to make that offer that Gillet had already booked other travel plans and cannot do another trip this year, so she refused the offer.</p> <p>It’s certainly understandable that travelers prefer to book pre-cruise travel on their own — often at a cheaper rate — but as long as cruise lines continue to get away with the “we can do whatever we want with our itinerary and we don’t owe you anything” clause, if you choose to cruise, it may be best to book your air and additional nights through the cruise line or buy travel insurance from another source (not the cruise line) that will cover itinerary changes, cancellations, and company defaults.</p> <p>We’re sorry we couldn’t help Gillet, but we still hope Pearl Seas Cruises comes to its senses and refunds her money.</p></article>
	<article id="0000883" published-at="2016-10-03" title="Is Avis’ 42 euro “referral” fee in Milan a scam?"><p>Italy’s infamous restricted traffic zones have struck again, this time snagging Douglas Schmucker, an unsuspecting Avis car rental customer.</p> <p>Schmucker doesn’t have a problem with the law, or following the law. Instead, his dispute is with Avis, which he says failed to warn him that its car rental facility in Milan was located in a “restricted” parking zone.</p> <p>And neglecting to disclose that little detail cost him money.</p> <p>AirHelp is the world’s leading flight delays compensation company, helping passengers apply for compensation following a delayed or canceled flight or when boarding has been denied. It is AirHelp’s mission to fight for passenger rights by holding airlines accountable for flights disruptions that are out of passengers’ control. AirHelp has already helped 5 million people, taking the stress out of applying for compensation and making it as hassle-free as possible for travelers around the world.</p> <p>“We recently received a letter from the legal office of Avis Italia informing us that we received a charge of 42 euros on a credit card to cover the cost of providing our rental information to the parking authority for driving in restricted Zone C in Milan,” he says. “We were entirely unaware that the Avis location was in a restricted driving zone and the Avis staff made no effort to inform us of that fact.”</p> <p>Actually, Avis does inform customers of the Italian traffic laws, and <a href="http://locations.avis.com/it/milan/ml9.html" type="external">specifically of the situation in Milan</a>, on its site.</p> <q> <p>Are there any roads or zones where I need to pay a fee before I can enter?</p> <p>Yes, certain areas, such as the centre of Milan-area C, have congestion charging zones meaning you need to pay a fee if you wish to drive in certain areas, on certain days and during certain times. In addition, there are toll roads and toll bridges which require you to pay a fee if you wish to use them. If you do not pay these charges before you enter such areas or use such roads or bridges, you will incur a fine.</p> <p>We recommend you check the Internet to find out about any restricted areas before you travel. Websites such as <a href="http://www.urbanaccessregulations.eu" type="external">www.urbanaccessregulations.eu</a> provide useful information. If the rental location is in or near a restricted area, we will tell you about it when you pick up the vehicle. We are unable to tell you about any other restricted areas.</p> </q> <p>But who has the time to read all of the fine print? Besides, someone from Avis should have said something to Schmucker, right?</p> <p>“Avis Milan must inform all clients who use the Piazza Diaz office of the need to obtain a permit for the restricted area for pick-up and drop-off of rental vehicle,” he says. “Avis also needs to revisit the 42-euro charge simply for providing clients’ contact info to the municipal authorities.”</p> <p>That’s a point worth underscoring. The 42 euros isn’t the traffic fine — it’s a referral fee so that Italian authorities can send Schmucker a fine. That’s a hefty price to pay for simply giving authorities a name — something that is likely automated, anyway.</p> <p>All of which leaves me wondering: Is this a scam?</p> <p>Consider that Avis must know that the location is in a restricted parking zone. While it warns customers in the fine print of its website, it surely knows that most customers will not bother to read it. Let’s assume the actual cost of sending Italian authorities to the name and contact information of its drivers is 2 euros.</p> <p>Isn’t that a little bit like raising the cost of your car rentals by 40 euros?</p> <p>Then again, customers were warned. Avis is just following the law. And maybe, just maybe, it actually costs Avis 42 euros for a referral — in other words, maybe it isn’t making any money from the transaction.</p> <p>I think you know which way I’m leaning on this one.</p> <p>“The 42 euro surcharge and the eventual traffic violation costs should be either dismissed or covered by Avis,” says Schmucker.</p> <p>I agree — that would be the ideal outcome.</p></article>
	<article id="0000884" published-at="2017-09-26" title="DirecTV Has Americans Cheering After NFL National Anthem Protests"><p>The NFL sparked a massive controversy over the past few days after hundreds of professional football players refused to stand for the national anthem in protest. Although this protesting has been going on since last year, the number of participants drastically increased after President Donald Trump’s controversial remarks; Trump insinuated, a few days prior to Sunday’s games, that the NFL should fire those who take a knee during the anthem.</p> <p>The protests, started by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in support of Black Lives Matter, were originally created to fight against police brutality and racial injustice. However, several teams, including the Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos, confirmed that they knelt directly in response to Trump’s comments.</p> <p>Therefore, the protests were no longer about racial injustice, but became an anti-Trump movement. Many Americans were angered by the protesting of the football players and threatened to boycott the NFL altogether because they felt it was disrespecting our American flag and those who serve(d) our country.</p> <p>These apparently were not empty threats. DirecTV announced that they are offering refunds to customers for purchases of the NFL Sunday Ticket if they desire to cancel in relation to the national anthem protesting. Hundreds of people have reportedly called the company in regards to cancellations.</p> <p>This is a big deal since the original policy clearly states that refunds cannot be issued once football season has begun, according to <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2017/09/26/directv-allows-some-nfl-refunds-after-anthem-controversy.html" type="external">Fox Business</a>. However, DirecTV is making exceptions this season in wake of the major controversy.</p> <p>Americans are praising DirecTV for their bold move. Although the company has not directly said they are against the #TakeAKnee movement, customers appreciate the fact that they are giving their clientele this option.</p> <p>Watch the Fox News Alert below for more information.</p> <p>What do you think about DirecTV refunding customers over the national anthem protesting? Share your thoughts in our Facebook comments. In related news, several <a type="internal">restaurants also took a bold stand</a> in the #TakeAKnee movement.</p></article>
	<article id="0000885" published-at="2017-08-09" title="Young Boy Undergoes Sex Change Three Times and Tragically Suffers"><p>As conservatives have dedicated a notable amount of time trying to stop efforts to let children suffering from gender confusion “change” their sex, the Left has responded with calls of “transphobia.” By listening to the Left, you’d think that conservatives were nothing short of inhumane and insensitive, opposing a measure that helps people be comfortable in their own bodies. That's at least the Left's narrative about this supposed struggle for "equality" and "civil rights."</p> <p>But nothing can be further from the truth. In fact, the Left’s effort to let children suffering from gender confusion “change” their sex has created many victims, one of them being 23-year old Brad Cooper, who has “changed” his sex a reported three times.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/19404/15-year-old-boy-undergoes-sex-change-surgery-guess-amanda-prestigiacomo?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=080817-news&amp;utm_campaign=dwtwitter" type="external">The Daily Wire</a> reports that Cooper, born a biological male, was allowed by his parents to change his sex at the young age of 15, earning him media praise as Britain’s “youngest sex-swap patient.” Doctors also agreed with Cooper and his parents that, despite being a biological boy, he was actually a girl trapped in a boy’s body.</p> <p>“Doctors controversially backed her belief she was a girl in a boy’s body,” writes the Daily Wire. “She was given blockers to stop her going through puberty, followed by injections of female hormones to impede face and chest hair and triggered the formation of breasts.”</p> <p>Despite being hailed a hero by the Jacobin Left, the confused young man then reversed his sex change process at the age of 18. And now, at the young age of 23, Cooper is “changing” his sex for a third time from a girl back to a boy.</p> <p>Cooper’s gender confusion has impacted him in more ways than the pains of being under continual gender-changing efforts. After undergoing his first sex change effort at the age of 15, Cooper attempted to commit suicide twice. He also got hooked on drugs, and even resorted to prostitution while still a minor, in part to pay for his lavish new female wardrobe. After suffering tragically from his disordered sexuality and painful lifestyle, he decided to stop his hormone treatment and once-more “change” back to a male, his biological sex.</p> <p>“I made so many mistakes,” remarked Cooper. “On the surface I was hard as nails, but underneath it hurt like hell. The puberty blockers and hormones made me moody and angry. I was all over the place. My mom supported me, but I moved out and went wild, drinking and taking drugs to cope with being different.”</p> <p>Now Cooper wishes to once more “return” to be a “woman.” He claims that being a woman is his true identity, and that one day he wishes to get married and have children.</p> <p>After embracing his biological sex, Cooper remarks that “it just felt wrong.” He continues, “I came to the realization pretty quickly I was doing it because I wanted all the problems associated with being transgender to go away. I was no longer able to hide who I really am. Not for family, or friends or potential boyfriends. I have to be true to myself.”</p> <p>“It’s hard to see a bright future for this poor victim,” remarks the Daily Wire. “Transgendered people suffer from an astronomical attempted suicide rate of 40% (eight times the rate of non-trans folk) and are much more likely to experience homelessness.”</p> <p>“Moreover, it’s clear that Cooper’s 15-year-old experience only compounded his problems,” continues the Daily Wire. “Upwards of 80% of children who suffer from gender dysphoria grow out of such confusion before adulthood; should cooper have been cared for as a 15-year-old in a manner that thoroughly addressed the condition psychologically, instead of opting for medical means to ‘change’ his biological sex, perhaps Cooper would have had a different future.”</p> <p>Rather than criticizing Cooper, who is clearly suffering, perhaps the best thing we can do is pray for him – pray that he abandons his disordered sexual proclivities and finds peace. Cooper, too, is a creation of God and a human being with inherent dignity who deserves a good life.</p> <p>In other news, Planned Parenthood is encouraging parents to let their kids “choose” their gender identity. In fact, they recently released a shocking report to parents, telling moms and dads that what they thought they knew about parenting might be wrong.

	<article id="0000886" published-at="2017-09-21" title="Jimmy Kimmel Tears Into Fox &amp; Friends Co-Host: 'You Phony Little Creep'"><p><a type="internal">Jimmy Kimmel</a> on Wednesday fired back at Senator Bill Cassidy, as well as Fox &amp;amp; Friends‘ Brian Kilmeade, for belittling his <a type="internal">impassioned health care monologue</a>.</p> <p>The ABC late-night host made headlines on Tuesday <a type="internal">for taking aim at Senators Cassidy and Lindsey Graham’s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act</a>. In response, Kilmeade referred to the late-night host as a Hollywood elitist pushing his political agenda on the rest of the country.</p> <p>“The reason I found this comment to be particularly annoying is because this is a guy who, whenever I see him, kisses my ass,” Kimmel said. “Oh, he’s such a fan… He follows me on Twitter; he asked me to write a blurb for his book, which I did; he calls my agent looking for projects. He’s dying to be a member of the Hollywood elite. The only reason he’s not a member of the Hollywood elite is because nobody will hire him to be one.</p> <p>“You know, the reason I’m talking about this is because <a type="internal">my son had an open-heart surgery</a>, then has to have two more, and because of that I learned that there are kids with no insurance in the same situation,” Kimmel continued. “I don’t get anything out of this, Brian, you phony little creep.”</p> <p>Kilmeade responded to Kimmel on Thursday’s edition of Fox &amp;amp; Friends, saying, “Last night, Jimmy Kimmel personally attacked me.” He continued, “I hope your son gets better” and “gets all the care he needs,” missing Kimmel’s point that it isn’t his son that would be affected by the bill, but millions of other children whose parents aren’t able to cover their medical costs. Kilmeade then suggested that Kimmel speak directly with Cassidy and Graham. (Kimmel, of course, already spoke with Cassidy, who appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live <a type="internal">after the host revealed that his son was sick</a>.)</p> <p>UPDATE: Kilmeade once again addressed Kimmel’s comments on his Fox News radio show, defending himself against — of all things — the idea that he ever wanted a career in Hollywood.</p> <p>“For him to go out and attack me personally, and try to get into my personality, saying, ‘He wants to be a Hollywood celebrity’? I’ve never… Why would I ever leave the number one network in all of cable… to get out to Los Angeles and do entertainment? I mean, what… what point is that? ‘No one will hire him’? It’s not even based in fact.”</p> <p>The rant, which lasted nearly seven minutes, also found Kilmeade taking umbrage with Kimmel suggesting that he was short. (Yes, really!)</p> <p>“I guess you said, ‘this little man,’ or something like that. I’m 5’10, 174 pounds. Sorry that’s not good enough for you, but I just think if you look at the average chart of a male in America, I think I’m pretty much on target.” Kudos?</p> <p>Adding fuel to the fire, Sen. Cassidy on Wednesday suggested to CNN’s Chris Cuomo that Kimmel simply “does not understand” the bill at all.</p> <p>“Oh, I get it. I don’t understand because I’m a talk show host, right?” Kimmel asked, sarcastically. Then, after listing over a dozen major health care organizations that “vehemently oppose the bill,” the late-night host suggested that perhaps the problem is that “I do understand, and you got caught with your G-O-Penis out.</p> <p>“I don’t want to turn this into a Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation, but when Senator Cassidy was on my show in May, he told me that he believed that every American family regardless of income should be able to get quality health care, and I believed he was sincere,” Kimmel continued. “Sadly, the bill he unveiled last week with Senator Lindsey Graham indicates that he was not sincere. It is, by many accounts, the worst health care bill yet.”</p> <p>Your thoughts on Kimmel’s response to Kilmeade’s “elitist” jab? Sound off below.</p></article>

	<article id="0000889" published-at="2017-12-30" title="France sets up tax dept to investigate Jews">
Emmanuel Macron. (photo credit: REUTERS) <p>Tel Aviv (Tribune News Service) - In Paris's 12th arrondissement, on Bercy Street by the banks of the River Seine, on the 13th floor of the Ministry of Finance is France's tax authority headquarters. Something has been afoot there recently that is liable to upset French Jews and spook their relations with the country in which they live. Under the radar, a secret department has been created with the sole purpose of handling tax evasion by French Jews. "Globes" can reveal for the first time the details of the secret department that is targeting Jews in France and new immigrants from France in Israel.</p> <p>Sources inform "Globes" that over the past year, the tax authority in the Fifth Republic founded a special department for dealing with French Jews. The department currently has 20 Hebrew-speaking employees, and is in the process of hiring five more. This extraordinary department is one of a kind. Tax authorities do not usually establish departments targeting a specific nationality or religion. The action is astonishing, especially when the country involved is France, which is constitutionally defined as a secular republic that refrains from "marking" people according to their religion. Tax authorities around the world do establish teams to deal with sectors whose tax reporting is questionable. They target a specific market when there is concern that it contains a large amount of unreported capital, such as the real estate market or the diamond market. Setting up a specific department dealing with a designated nationality or religion, however, is not an accepted practice.</p> <p>The only "department" ostensibly close in character to this secret French department is a new department established in the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for dealing with cases of Israelis, American-Israelis, and Americans with assets and money in Israel. This US department, however, resulted from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) signed by Israel and the US, in which huge amounts of information are transferred by the countries about their taxpayers, and someone has to handle that information. This was not the purpose for which the department was set up in the French tax authority.</p> <p>The French department was established to handle French Jewish tax evaders, and hired employees with professional experience and a profound understanding of Israeli law in order to examine whether Jews were using these laws to evade tax in France. The aim of the department is to catch French tax evaders using Israel as a tax shelter.</p> <p>Examining real estate deals An international lawyer specializing in taxation who is familiar with the secret department says, "It is very, very irregular to hire 20 Hebrew-speaking employees, or any other language, in a foreign tax authority. Most tax authorities have one or two Hebrew-speakers, and there are English or French-speaking employees in Israel for the purpose of signing conventions and conducting relations with the tax authorities of other countries. Every tax authority has employees that speak a foreign language, but hiring 20 or more Hebrew-speaking investigators is very irregular." The lawyer adds that he learned from his acquaintance with the department and its employees that some of the employees hired previously lived in Israel. "They hired Hebrew-speaking French people, some of whom previously lived in Israel and moved back to France," he told Globes. According to information obtained by Globes, as part of the department's activity, its employees take out Land Registry extracts in Israel for the purpose of examining deals contracted in Israel and reaching French residents who have acquired properties here. The investigators have mapped the main streets in various cities in Israel, including Tel Aviv, Herzliya, Ra'anana, Netanya and Jerusalem, in which many purchases by Jewish residents of France take place. They have obtained Land Registry extracts and examined the particulars of a deal in order to detect foreign passport numbers. The investigators cross-referenced the information with information in their databases and the reports by those French Jews about their assets and income. In cases in which it was found that the person did not report the properties he bought in Israel, he was also summoned for questioning.</p> <p>Sources inform Globes that a French Jew recently went to the secret department for an "audit" without knowing exactly what was to be discussed. For safety's sake, he took his lawyer with him - a fact that proved extremely important for him. During the discussion about his declarations of his assets and funds, the questioners very quickly presented a Land Registry extract including all of the French Jewish client's housing units in Israel. The discussion took place, and at the end, the lawyer wondered in what framework the new investigation was taking place. A seemingly innocent casual conversation in the corridor with one of the investigators revealed the amazing fact that a special department for dealing with French Jews and their tax evasion was involved.</p> <p>Targeting immigrants to Israel from France, French Jewry boosts demand for Israeli homes not because of antisemitism, but for love of Israel. Through the special division, in addition to mapping the properties of French people in Israel, the tax authority in France has begun direct interrogations of Jewish residents of France who are in the midst of immigrating to Israel, and examining whether they possess money or assets that they did not previously declare, and whether this is the reason why they decided to immigrate to Israel.</p> Democrats Want This Video Erased From The Internet. Watch Before It's Gone <p>According to figures from the Israel Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, i <a type="internal">mmigration from France</a>has increased dramatically in recent years. 1,211 new immigrants arrived in Israel from France in the first half of 2017. A study conducted at Bar-Ilan University showed that the economic benefit for the Israeli economy from the absorption of Jews from France would reach $65 billion. The study assumes that 100,000 immigrants will arrive from France by 2026.</p> <p>These figures are surprising to no one. Massive purchases of properties in Israel by French people have been spoken of for years, some by immigrants and some not, and a number of international investigations were opened against French people on suspicion of tax offenses and evasion on an enormous scale in France and laundering money in Israel through real estate purchases. These developments apparently attracted the attention of the French tax authority, which decided to target French Jews.</p> <p>The sources also told Globes that the French tax authority is one of the main tax authorities that contacts the Israel Tax Authority in order to obtain information about French residents with exceptionally large assets in Israel, compared with other countries, but many of the requests are rejected. "They call the Israel Tax Authority almost every day with requests for information about some person or other, but many of the requests are rejected, because they do not meet the conditions of the conventions on exchanges of information. "They are just fishing," says a source involved in information exchanges between the two countries.</p> <p>The French embassy in Israel said in response, "In the framework of the campaign against tax evasion, the authorities in France conduct investigations concerning individual cases, in accordance with the international agreements. The authorities in France deny the existence of a special department. It is extremely important to state that the things that were written are false.</p> <p>"Taxes in France are calculated according to risk considerations. There is therefore no connection whatsoever to the national affiliation or ethnic origin of taxpayers. Next year, automatic exchanges of information are scheduled between OECD member countries." ©2017 the Globes (Tel Aviv, Israel) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency.</p> <p>Join Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content. <a href="https://members.jpost.com/RegistrationPaywall.aspx" type="external">Click here&amp;gt;&amp;gt;</a></p> Tags: <a type="internal">france</a> <a type="internal">money</a> <a type="internal">jews</a></article>

Sees Black Spot in Distance Start Swimming Toward Them"><p>When the Nikitina family went on vacation this summer, they had no idea it would end in bringing home a new family member. During a fun day on the Black Sea full of sailing and swimming, they ventured out way beyond the mainland.</p> <p>It wasn’t until the family was passing a remote island that they heard an unusual sound. At first, all they could make out was a faint black creature yelping from a cluster of rocks near the shore of the island.</p> <p>“The sound gradually intensified. At first it was nearly invisible, but then I could see this black spot moving in the distance,” said Natalia Nikitina.</p> <p>As they got closer, they realized that the mysterious black shape was, in fact, a kitten!

	<article id="0000894" published-at="2017-12-21" title="Is Illegal Immigration Responsible for the Decline in Labor Force Participation?"><p>Why are prime-age men dropping out of the labor force? And what can we do about it? A few days ago the Two Jasons tackled this question and came up with very different answers. <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/454859/male-labor-force-participation-immigration" type="external">Here is Jason Richwine criticizing Jason Furman:</a></p> <q> <p>How about restricting low-skill immigration to encourage recruitment of Americans? No, Furman says, because — well, actually, he does not mention immigration at all, not even to dismiss its importance. Omitting the i-word in discussions of labor-force dropout is an unfortunate habit on both the left and the right. Amy Wax and I wrote our Inquirer op-ed (based on a much longer essay in American Affairs) to show that employers turned to immigrants as the native work ethic declined. As evidence, we point both to the much higher labor-force participation of low-skill immigrants compared to low-skill natives, as well as to the near-universal preference expressed by employers for immigrant labor. Restricting the flow of foreign workers would generate a major incentive for business owners, politicians, and opinion leaders to reintegrate American men into the labor force. It is, in our opinion, a crucial part of any reform strategy.</p> </q> <p>I don’t have a huge dog in this fight since, by lefty standards anyway, I’m pretty open to policies that humanely restrict illegal immigration. But I have a couple of questions for Jason R that I’m genuinely interested in. First, there’s this:</p> <p>Labor force participation of women rose steadily starting with the feminist revolution of the 60s. However, participation peaked in the late 90s and has been declining ever since. In other words, for the past couple of decades this is a problem that’s not restricted just to men. Is illegal immigration affecting the labor force participation of women the same way?</p> <p>Second, if illegal immigration really is a factor, then labor force participation of native workers should be correlated with the amount of illegal immigration. But it doesn’t seem to be:</p> <p>I don’t want to make too much of this, since the Great Recession obviously had a big impact on both illegal immigration rates and labor force participation. Still, overall labor participation turned down in 2000 and then turned down even more in 2009. But illegal immigration rates didn’t change in 2000, and then changed in the wrong direction in 2009. Lower immigration rates should have increased labor force participation. What’s more, labor force participation among men has been dropping steadily since the 60s, with the rate hardly changing at all even as illegal immigration has spiked up and down.</p> <p>There are so many other, bigger factors that affect labor force participation that I don’t really expect much from this comparison. But I’d expect at least a glimmer of something if unauthorized workers from Mexico really are causing native workers to just give up on the job market. Why don’t we see anything?</p></article>
	<article id="0000895" published-at="2017-12-20" title="The Trump Administration Just Proposed a New Way to Screw Over the States That Supported Him">
Mother Jones illustration <p>President Trump has long championed himself as a hero of America’s working class. But, as my colleague Noah Lanard <a type="internal">highlighted</a> back in September, Trump’s praise of the American worker is spoiled by how rapidly his Labor Department has pursued policies, like working to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/26/539438892/labor-department-starts-to-roll-back-obama-overtime-rule" type="external">roll back</a> overtime eligibility for millions of workers and <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20170831" type="external">delaying</a> a requirement that financial advisers actually act in their clients’ best interests, that would further diminish their already-dwindling wages.</p> <p>And earlier this month, the administration took another step toward making things even worse for low-wage workers with a proposed a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/05/2017-25802/tip-regulations-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act-flsa" type="external">rule change</a> that will allow employers to pool the tips their employees earn (think servers at a restaurant) and share them with their untipped coworkers (think cooks and dishwashers). In a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20171204" type="external">press release</a> announcing the rule change, the Department of Labor claims “the proposal would help decrease wage disparities between tipped and non-tipped workers.”</p> <p>But here’s the rub: The rule doesn’t actually require that employers share those tips with untipped staff. Under the proposal, employers can pocket those tips as long as workers earn the minimum wage. In fact, the Department of Labor all but openly <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/05/2017-25802/tip-regulations-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act-flsa" type="external">acknowledges</a> that the change could lead to this scenario: “The proposed rule rescinds those portions of the 2011 regulations that restrict employer use of customer tips when the employer pays at least the full Federal minimum wage.”</p> <p>Now, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has a new <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/employers-would-pocket-6-1-billion-of-workers-tips-under-trump-administrations-proposed-tip-stealing-rule/" type="external">report</a> that totally debunks the Trump administration’s argument that the move will decrease wage disparities. Far from boosting the stagnating wages of workers, the rule change would in fact clear the path for rampant wage theft in an industry already <a href="http://www.nelp.org/content/uploads/2015/03/BrokenLawsReport2009.pdf" type="external">wracked</a> by the practice, just as worker advocates have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/12/07/the-trump-administration-proposes-allow-tip-pooling-in-restaurants-critics-call-it-stealing-workers-wages/?utm_term=.e7f0085873eb" type="external">warned</a>.According to EPI’s estimates, employers across the country are likely to pocket $5.8 billion worth of employees’ wages if the rule goes through, in addition to an <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/two-billion-dollars-in-stolen-wages-were-recovered-for-workers-in-2015-and-2016-and-thats-just-a-drop-in-the-bucket/" type="external">estimated</a> $50 billion in wage theft already occurring nationwide.</p> <p>And, as it turns out, many of the states who stand to lose the most from the change will be those that went for Trump. “The states that have the weakest labor protections tend to be the states that vote Republican in presidential elections,” David Cooper, a senior economic analyst with EPI and co-author of the report, tells Mother Jones. “So this is just another example of the Trump administration’s policies screwing over the very people he claims to be fighting for.”</p> <p>The EPI researchers clustered states based on the level of protection their laws afford to the earnings of tipped employees. According to their analysis, 28 states fall into what basically translates into the least protective category, meaning they do the poorest job of making sure that employees’ tips make it home with them. These are the states most vulnerable to the rule change. (Some of that vulnerability stems from them falling outside of enforcement guidelines flowing from rulings in the <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/I2df61d603a1011e598dc8b09b4f043e0/View/FullText.html?contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;transitionType=Default&amp;firstPage=true&amp;bhcp=1" type="external">4th</a> and <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/16-1134/16-1134-2017-06-30.html" type="external">10th circuit</a>.) Of the 28 states, 19 broke for Trump in 2016. In 11 of those states—Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Tennessee—Trump won by double digits. EPI estimates that in these 28 states, anywhere from 4.1 percent to 100 percent of tips will be pocketed by employers. In other words, tipped workers across those states could lose between $385 million to $9.6 billion in wages. The EPI’s current prediction, or “preferred estimate”: a staggering 43.91 percent of potentially transferred tips, or $4.2 billion, will be shifted from employees to bosses.</p> <p>“This is particularly brazen and really disheartening for workers in those states [that voted for Trump],” Cooper says. “If their employer is cheating them, many of these states defer their wage theft enforcement capabilities to the federal government. So if I was in one those states and thought my employer was cheating me, I wouldn’t even have recourse within the state government to seek damages. I’d have to go to the Feds, and what Trump is essentially doing is saying that at the federal level, he’s going to legalize employers stealing from their workers.”</p> <p>The rule is currently under consideration, and due to enormous <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/labor/364495-dol-extends-comment-period-for-tip-pooling-rule-amid-backlash" type="external">pressure</a> from worker advocates and Democratic lawmakers, is now in the middle of an extended 60 day public comment period.</p> <p>Image credit: Nerthuz/Getty; BeeBright/Getty</p></article>
	<article id="0000896" published-at="2017-12-13" title="Trump Is Going Ballistic Against Journalists. What Is He So Afraid Of?"><p>Throughout Donald Trump’s first year as president, I’ve kept <a type="internal">a running record of his authoritarian behavior titled “Trumpocracy.”</a> A major component of this now very lengthy document has been his ceaseless attack on the American news media. But although Trump’s rants against reporting he dislikes are at this point extremely familiar (or daresay, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LyevPdfbe0&amp;feature=youtu.be" type="external">normal</a>), his assault on the free press has intensified in recent days. For Trump, if it’s not Fox News then it’s Fake News—and that now means war on a very personal level. Over the past two weeks, Trump has singled out no fewer than four individual journalists for bullying and ridicule, while his press secretary has threatened a fifth:</p> CNN’s Don Lemon: Blasting a “failing New York Times” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/us/politics/donald-trump-president.html" type="external">report</a> about his TV-viewing habits, Trump denied that he watches much CNN and highlighted for the public that <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/940223974985871360" type="external">he calls</a> the CNN anchor “the dumbest man on television!” The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel: When Weigel tweeted a misinterpretation of a crowd photo from a Trump rally in Pensacola, Florida on Friday, Trump called him out and demanded an apology and retraction from the “Fake News WaPo.” After Weigel quickly issued <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/president-trump-calls-for-washington-post-reporter-who-apologized-for-inaccurate-tweet-to-be-fired/2017/12/09/2fb467de-dd4b-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html?utm_term=.079c47daabe3" type="external">a correction and apology</a>, Trump attacked him again, alleging Weigel’s mistake was intentional and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/939634404267380736" type="external">declaring that he should be fired.</a> ABC News’ Brian Ross: After the investigative correspondent made a significant error, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/12/03/abc-news-apologizes-for-serious-error-in-trump-report-suspends-brian-ross-for-four-weeks/?utm_term=.20576f0c9a46" type="external">soon corrected</a>, about Trump’s interactions with his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump blasted Ross for “his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt.” Trump went on to call Ross a “fraudster,” blamed him for a big drop in the stock market that was allegedly due to the erroneous report, and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937309279257792512" type="external">urged the public to sue ABC</a> for financial damages. MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough: A previous target of the president’s ire, the morning show host and fierce Trump critic came under attack again after NBC’s firing of Matt Lauer over sexual misconduct, with Trump dredging up <a type="internal">a baseless conspiracy theory</a> about the “unsolved mystery” of a young intern who died in Scarborough’s congressional office in 2001. CNN’s Jim Acosta: Another previous Trump target, Acosta <a href="https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/940631884241031169" type="external">reported</a> on Tuesday that he was threatened by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: He might be blocked from doing future coverage, she told him, if he asked Trump during a bill signing about a <a type="internal">degrading tweet</a> against Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. <p>Meanwhile, during this same period, Trump repeatedly <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937661677700550656" type="external">praised</a> content from State Television Fox News and personally promoted a new book by a Fox host—part of <a type="internal">another long-term pattern:</a></p> <q> <p>Day 322: Trump urges the public to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/938756989542457344" type="external">“go get the new book”</a> by “Fox &amp;amp; Friends” host Brian Kilmeade, adding to a list of partisan supporters whose commercial products Trump has personally endorsed as president including Fox’s Sean Hannity (see Nov. 14), Fox regular Sheriff David Clarke (see Aug. 27), and others.

	<article id="0000898" published-at="2017-11-16" title="L’Affaire Moore, &amp;c.">
(Reuters photo: Marvin Gentry) <p>The tragedy in Alabama, the tragedy in Venezuela, the arrogance of presidents, a medal ceremony in the Persian Gulf, and more</p> <p>If you’re Roy Moore’d out, I don’t blame you. But I’d like to make a few Moore points nonetheless. (I didn’t mean that as a pun, I really didn’t.)</p> <p>From what he has said over the years, Moore regards the 9/11 attacks as punishment for America’s sins. I wonder whether he sees his current predicament in a similar light. It would be interesting to see him address this at some point (after the election, surely).</p> <p>‐A lot of good Alabamians, no doubt, contributed to Moore’s charity, the Foundation for Moral Law. (Wonderful name, wonderful concept.) He ripped them off, using the foundation as a personal piggy bank. And now he has ripped them off in another way, you could say: He has embarrassed them and the “cause.”</p> <p>For years and years — ever since the Scopes trial in the 1920s — the religious Right has tried to escape the stigma of Gantryism. And time after time, the Roy Moores — the Jimmy Swaggarts, the Jim Bakkers, the Falwell Juniors — kill them.</p> <p>At least that’s the way I see it …</p> <p>‐Nigel Farage was one of the many people who rallied for Roy Moore in the Alabama primary. (The Right welcomes foreign interference, at least some of the time!) He saw the primary in a global light. Support of Moore, he said, was “important for the whole global movement across the West that we have built up and we have fought for.”</p> <p>(Farage had just been in Germany, campaigning for that country’s alt-Right — a literal alt-Right, known as the AfD, which stands for “Alternative für Deutschland.”)</p> <p>Has “the whole global movement” been harmed by the Moore affair?</p> <p>‐Farage was doing his radio show the other day — a call-in show. In called Ahmed from Leyton, who had a point to make: People were talking about the Kremlin’s influence on America, but what about AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and Israel?</p> <p>A good point, said Farage. “There are about 6 million Jewish people living in America, so as a percentage it’s quite small, but in terms of influence it’s quite big.”</p> <p>Wrapping up, Farage thanked his “new caller from Leyton” and said, “He makes the point that there are other very powerful lobbies in the United States of America, and the Jewish lobby, with its links with the Israeli government, is one of those strong voices.”</p> <p>Get the difference: The Kremlin is a foreign government, interfering in American elections; the “Jewish lobby” is composed of Americans, petitioning their government. And what is the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States? Christians United for Israel, with more than 2 million members.</p> <p>Perhaps Mr. Farage could mention them the next time he is highlighting the Jewish influence on America.</p> <p>‐While we’re on the subject: A man posing as a Washington Post reporter was trolling around Alabama. He was offering cash in exchange for dirt on Roy Moore. Between $5,000 and $7,000! He was trying to discredit the Post’s reporting, of course.</p> <p>And what was he calling himself? “Bernie Bernstein.” Interesting. Wonder if the name was chosen at random. Could just as easily have been “John Smith,” right? Or even “Lucy Hickenlooper.”</p> <p>(This was the real name of Olga Samaroff, the pianist who married Leopold Stokowski, the conductor, who was also married to Gloria Vanderbilt, who is Anderson Cooper’s mother.)</p> <p>‐Have you seen the Nicolás Maduro video? It’s great. Maduro, the boss of Venezuela, had already been criticized for gaining weight in the midst of a food crisis. Venezuelans are starving.</p> <p>Maduro was giving a speech on live television. After he finished, he reached into his desk and pulled out an empanada, which he readily chomped. The cameras were still rolling.</p> <p>“Not a good look,” as they say on Twitter.</p> <p>To see it, go <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/735317/venezuelan-dictator-eats-empanada-live-tv-country-starves" type="external">here</a>.</p> <p>‐We on the right often criticized President Obama for his arrogance, among other things. We often quoted something he said in 2008, when he was running: “I think that I’m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters. I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors. And I’ll tell you right now that I’m gonna think I’m a better political director than my political director.”</p> <p>I thought of that when listening to President Trump — who was asked about all the vacancies at the State Department. “Let me tell you, the one that matters is me. I’m the only one that matters.” (This is a cousin of “L’Etat, c’est moi.”)</p> <p>Here is Trump again: “The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me. I’ve always been great with money.”</p> <p>This puts Obama in the shade, I think.</p> <p>‐Bernie Sanders (not “Bernie Bernstein”) tweeted this: “We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. How is it possible that 2 months after Hurricane Maria half the people of Puerto Rico don’t have electricity?” The senator may be right about Puerto Rico: that reconstruction is going way too slow. I don’t know, as I have not studied the issue.</p> <p>But I think I know this: If we are, indeed, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, it’s because we have steadfastly rejected the system that Senator Sanders would impose on us.</p> <p>‐The Virginia gubernatorial race seems a thousand years ago, I know. But I’d like to mention this: The GOP gave the impression that they liked immigrants less than Confederates. This is, I think, a bad impression.</p> <p>How can you propose a sensible immigration policy, and staunchly oppose illegal immigration, without coming off as anti-immigrant? For one thing, you can point out that immigration has been a boon to this country. To us all. We owe our very presence here to immigration.</p> <p>That is not too elementary to point out. And it might make the “medicine” of restrictionism go down better.</p> <p>‐A musician friend of mine writes something funny (maybe inadvertently so): “How is ‘molto moderato’ not a contradiction? What the hell does it mean?”</p> <p>“Very moderate.” Heh. True. Kind of a puzzler. I think it might mean “determinedly moderato. Don’t you budge from it!”</p> <p>‐I learned something, and saw something, via Tom Gross. The video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3S5y8ntrk4" type="external">here</a>.</p> <p>A big international judo competition was held in Abu Dhabi. Israelis participated — though they were the only participants forbidden to attach their national flag to their clothing. One of them, Tal Flicker, won a gold medal.</p> <p>At the medal ceremony, flags of the place-finishers were raised. But not the Israeli flag. In its place — the gold-medal position — was the flag of the International Judo Federation. The Israeli national anthem (“Hatikvah”) was not played. In its place was the anthem of the International Judo Federation. (Who knew?)</p> <p>There on the stand, the gold medalist sang his national anthem anyway. “The anthem that they played from the world federation was just background noise,” he later said. “I was singing ‘Hatikvah’ from my heart.”</p> <p>So great, so great.</p> <p>‐I returned to the United States from abroad the other day. There were two lines at the airport: “U.S.” and “Non-U.S.” Oh, give me a break. “Non-U.S.”! People are terrified to say “foreign.”</p> <p>Remember when Ted Turner forbade CNN to say “foreign”? You had to say “international” (which has a different meaning).</p> <p>Golf announcers, announcing PGA Tour events, speak of foreign players as “international players.” Oh, you mean the guy holds multiple passports? He’s from Trieste or something?</p> <p>So silly, so unnecessary. Anthony Daniels — a.k.a. Theodore Dalrymple — says that he likes being a foreigner: He likes the status of foreigner, he likes being in countries not his own. Anyone can understand this.</p> <p>‐Earlier this week, I passed a restaurant called “Mexicue.” Now, I love Mexican food and barbecue above most things on earth. What about the combination? Heaven? Or more like a hell? Two great things are not necessarily great combined. (Fruit and chocolate, my sister would argue, and I tend to agree.)</p> <p>I’ll let you know …</p> <p>READ MORE:</p> <p>A word from the National Review Store: To get Digging In: Further Collected Writings of Jay Nordlinger, go <a href="http://store.nationalreview.com/collections/books/products/diggin-in-by-jay-nordlinger" type="external">here</a>.</p></article>

In the aftermath of the terrible loss of life and so many people hurt, the question has been why? But the real question people should ask is, why not?</p> <p>The good, decent Christian morals and values that this country is built upon have been attacked and erased by the liberal left. So ultimately some godless, gutless, slime ball is going to think, why not?</p> <p>It’s Liberals who have attacked the gospel underpinnings of this nation, creating a society where unborn babies are considered non-human organisms that can be butchered and killed as they see fit. Perverts who raised their children to be transsexual used to be put in jail.</p> <p>Now Liberals and the liberal media lift them up as wonderful and desirable.</p> <p>And anyone who opposes even this are they themselves considered to be evil and hated by Liberals. So within this godless vacuum, some think why not?</p> <p>So thank you to the Liberal Democrat politicians, godless lowlifes that they are, for craftily blaming others for what they have unleashed upon our society. And the same also to all those who support them, and to others who remain silent and never speak out against this liberal evil.</p> <p>Evan Rubins</p> <p>Every year, there are nearly 12,000 firearm homicides in our country. That’s more people than live in Catawba, Claremont, and Conover, combined.</p> <p>According to a study published in The American Journal of Medicine, compared with 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. Why?</p> <p>It comes down to regulations, enforcement, education, and expectations – in short, the culture.</p> <p>One pundit, Bill O’Reilly, blogged that gun violence is “the price of freedom.” I disagree. My vote is with the majority of Americans who support firearm control. I don’t mean outlawing them, but enacting sensible policies on background checks, silencers, and assault weapons, to name a few.</p> <p>What will it take? Thoughtful lawmakers who will consider and support reasoned legislation.</p> <p>Let’s look at our representatives. At the federal level, we have Sen. Richard Burr, who voted against a ban on assault weapons, and Sen. Thom Tillis, who voted against prohibiting the transfer of firearms to suspected terrorists.</p> <p>Last year, both senators voted against universal background checks for firearms purchases.</p> <p>Our congressman, Patrick McHenry, says on his website that he is “currently a co-sponsor of legislation that will protect Second Amendment rights, including the SAFE Act and National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, allowing for concealed carry reciprocity among states.”</p> <p>He earned an A rating from the National Rifle Association, while State Sen. Andy Wells has received an NRA 93 percent rating. State Rep. Jay Adams sponsored the “Constitutional Carry Act,” which would allow any U.S. citizen 18 years or older to be able to carry a concealed handgun, unless otherwise disallowed by state or federal law. What is the sense in that?</p> <p>Responsible gun owners tell me the N.C. permitting process is reasonable and sound. Why let someone, like me, carry a weapon without checking whether I understand the weapon and safety?</p> <p>Remember the lesson relearned from Watergate? Follow the money. In 2016, the NRA gave Donald Trump, Burr, and five other Senate candidates $50.2 million (Burr got $6.2 million, the biggest chunk after Trump).</p> <p>Imagine how much education, and more, you could fund for $50.2 million?

As the U.S. government doles out tens of millions of dollars to “combat Russian propaganda,” one result is a slew of new “studies” by “scholars” and “researchers” auditioning for the loot, reports Robert Parry. <p>( <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/28/the-slimy-business-of-russia-gate/" type="external">CN</a>) — The “Field of Dreams” slogan for America’s NGOs should be: “If you pay for it, we will come.” And right now, tens of millions of dollars are flowing to non-governmental organizations if they will buttress the thesis of Russian “meddling” in the U.S. democratic process no matter how sloppy the “research” or how absurd the “findings.”</p> <p>And, if you think the pillars of the U.S. mainstream media – The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN and others – will apply some quality controls, you haven’t been paying attention for the past year or so. The MSM is just as unethical as the NGOs are.</p> <p>So, we are now in a phase of Russiagate in which NGO “scholars” produce deeply biased reports and their nonsense is treated as front-page news and items for serious discussion across the MSM.</p> <p>Yet, there’s even an implicit confession about how pathetic some of this “scholarship” is in the hazy phrasing that gets applied to the “findings,” although the weasel words will slip past most unsuspecting Americans and will be dropped for more definitive language when the narrative is summarized in the next day’s newspaper or in a cable-news “crawl.”</p> <p>For example, a Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/twitter-russia-election.html?mcubz=3" type="external">front-page story</a> on Thursday reported that “a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the [NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem] issue with hashtags, such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee.”</p> <p>The story, which fits neatly into the current U.S. propaganda meme that the Russian government somehow is undermining American democracy by stirring up dissent inside the U.S., quickly spread to other news outlets and became the latest “proof” of a Russian “war” against America.</p> <p>However, before we empty the nuclear silos and exterminate life on the planet, we might take a second to look at the Times phrasing: “a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia.”</p> <p>The vague wording doesn’t even say the Russian government was involved but rather presents an unsupported claim that some Twitter accounts are “suspected” of being part of some “network” and that this “network” may have some ill-defined connection – or “links” – to “Russia,” a country of 144 million people.</p> ‘Six Degrees from Kevin Bacon’ <p>It’s like the old game of “six degrees of separation” from Kevin Bacon. Yes, perhaps we are all “linked” to Kevin Bacon somehow but that doesn’t prove that we know Kevin Bacon or are part of a Kevin Bacon “network” that is executing a grand conspiracy to sow discontent by taking opposite sides of issues and then tweeting.</p> <p>Yet that is the underlying absurdity of the Times article by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Scott Shane. Still, as silly as the article may be that doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous. The Times’ high-profile treatment of these gauzy allegations represents a grave danger to the world by fueling a growing hysteria inside the United States about being “at war” with nuclear-armed Russia. At some point, someone might begin to take this alarmist rhetoric seriously.</p> <p>Yes, I understand that lots of people hate President Trump and see Russiagate as the golden ticket to his impeachment. But that doesn’t justify making serious allegations with next to no proof, especially when the outcome could be thermonuclear war.</p> <p>However, with all those millions of dollars sloshing around the NGO world and Western academia – all looking for some “study” to fund that makes Russia look bad – you are sure to get plenty of takers. And, we should now expect that new “findings” like these will fill in for the so-far evidence-free suspicions about Russia and Trump colluding to steal the presidency from Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>If you read more deeply into the Times story, you get a taste of where Russiagate is headed next and a clue as to who is behind it:</p> <p>“Since last month, researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, have been publicly tracking 600 Twitter accounts — human users and suspected bots alike — they have linked to Russian influence operations. Those were the accounts pushing the opposing messages on the N.F.L. and the national anthem.</p> <p>“Of 80 news stories promoted last week by those accounts, more than 25 percent ‘had a primary theme of anti-Americanism,’ the researchers found. About 15 percent were critical of Hillary Clinton, falsely accusing her of funding left-wing antifa — short for anti-fascist — protesters, tying her to the lethal terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and discussing her daughter Chelsea’s use of Twitter. Eleven percent focused on wiretapping in the federal investigation into Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, with most of them treated the news as a vindication for President Trump’s earlier wiretapping claims.”</p> The Neocons, Again! <p>So, let’s stop and unpack this Times’ reporting. First, this Alliance for Securing Democracy is not some neutral truth-seeking organization but a neoconservative-dominated outfit that includes on <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/team/advisory-council" type="external">its advisory board</a> such neocon luminaries as Mike Chertoff, Bill Kristol and former Freedom House president David Kramer along with other anti-Russia hardliners such as former deputy CIA director Michael Morell and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers.</p> <p>How many of these guys, do you think, were assuring us that Iraq was hiding WMDs back in 2003?</p> <p>This group clearly has an ax to grind, a record of deception, and plenty of patrons in the Military-Industrial Complex who stand to make billions of dollars from the New Cold War.</p> <p>The neocons also have been <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/10/07/key-neocon-calls-on-us-to-oust-putin/" type="external">targeting Russia for regime change</a> for years because they see Russian President Vladimir Putin as the chief obstacle to their goal of helping Israel achieve its desire for “regime change” in Syria and a chance to bomb-bomb-bomb Iran. Russiagate has served the neocons well as a very convenient way to pull Democrats, liberals and even progressives into the neocon agenda because Russiagate is sold as a powerful weapon for the anti-Trump Resistance.</p> <p>The Times article also might have mentioned that Twitter has 974 million accounts. So, this alarm over 600 accounts is a bit disproportionate for a front-page story in the Times, don’t you think?</p> <p>And, there’s the definitional problem of what constitutes “anti-Americanism” in a news article. And what does it mean to be “linked to Russian influence operations”? Does that include Americans who may not march in lockstep to the one-sided State Department narratives on the crises in Ukraine and Syria? Any deviation from Official Washington’s groupthink makes you a “Moscow stooge.”</p> <p>And, is it a crime to be “critical” of Hillary Clinton or to note that the U.S. mainstream media was dismissive of Trump’s claims about being wiretapped only for us to find out later that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/politics/paul-manafort-government-wiretapped-fisa-russians/index.html" type="external">the FBI apparently was wiretapping</a> his campaign manager?</p> <p>However, such questions aren’t going to be asked amid what has become a massive Russiagate groupthink, dominating not just Official Washington, but across much of America’s political landscape and throughout the European Union.</p> Why the Bias? <p>Beyond the obvious political motivations for this bias, we also have had the introduction of vast sums of money pouring in from the U.S. government, NATO and European institutions to <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/12/01/the-orwellian-war-against-skepticism/" type="external">support the business</a> of “combatting Russian propaganda.”</p> <p>For example, last December, President Obama signed into law a $160 million funding mechanism entitled the “Combating Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act.” But that amounts to only a drop in the bucket considering already existing Western propaganda projects targeting Russia.</p> <p>So, a scramble is on to develop seemingly academic models to “prove” what Western authorities want proven: that Russia is at fault for pretty much every bad thing that happens in the world, particularly the alienation of many working-class people from the Washington-Brussels elites.</p> <p>The truth cannot be that establishment policies have led to massive income inequality and left the working class struggling to survive and thus are to blame for ugly political manifestations – from Trump to Brexit to the surprising support for Germany’s far-right AfD party. No, it must be Russia! Russia! Russia! And there’s a lot of money on the bed to prove that point.</p> <p>There’s also the fact that the major Western news media is deeply invested in bashing Russia as well as in the related contempt for Trump and his followers. Those twin prejudices have annihilated all professional standards that would normally be applied to news judgments regarding these flawed “studies.”</p> <p>On Thursday, The Washington Post ran its own banner-headlined <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/lawmaker-russian-trolls-trying-to-sow-discord-in-nfl-kneeling-debate/2017/09/27/5f46dce0-a3b0-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?utm_term=.5248f34f0f8d" type="external">story</a> drawn from the same loose accusations made by that neocon-led Alliance for Securing Democracy, but instead the Post sourced the claims to Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma. The headline read: “Russian trolls are stoking NFL controversy, senator says.”</p> <p>The “evidence” cited by Lankford’s office was one “Twitter account calling itself Boston Antifa that gives its geolocation as Vladivostok, Russia,” the Post reported.</p> <p>By Thursday, Twitter had suspended the Boston Antifa account, so I couldn’t send it a question, but earlier this month, Dan Glaun, a reporter for Masslive.com, <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/09/fake_boston_antifa_group_who_c.html" type="external">reported that the people</a> behind Boston Antifa were “a pair of anti-leftist pranksters from Oregon who started Boston Antifa as a parody of actual anti-fascist groups.”</p> <p>In an email to me on Thursday, Glaun cited <a href="https://www.therebel.media/gavin_mcinnes_april_7_2017?safari_redirect" type="external">an interview</a> that the Boston Antifa pranksters had done with right-wing radio talk show host Gavin McInnes last April.</p> <p>And, by the way, there are <a href="https://ilegality.wordpress.com/2013/05/18/spoof-your-geolocation-on-twitter/" type="external">apps that let you manipulate</a> your geolocation data on Twitter. Or, you can choose to believe that the highly professional Russian intelligence agencies didn’t notice that they were telegraphing their location as Vladivostok.</p> Mindless Russia Bashing <p>Another example of this mindless Russia bashing appeared just below the Post’s story on Lankford’s remarks. The Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2017/09/27/32855bba-a3a0-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?utm_term=.bb2ca7e4ad02" type="external">sidebar</a> cited a “study” from researchers at Oxford University’s Project on Computational Propaganda asserting that “junk news” on Twitter “flowed more heavily in a dozen [U.S.] battleground states than in the nation overall in the days immediately before and after the 2016 presidential election, suggesting that a coordinated effort targeted the most pivotal voters.” Cue the spooky Boris and Natasha music!</p> <p>Of course, any Americans living in “battleground states” could tell you that they are inundated with all kinds of election-related “junk,” including negative TV advertising, nasty radio messages, alarmist emails and annoying robo-calls at dinner time. That’s why they’re called “battleground states,” Sherlock.</p> <p>But what’s particularly offensive about this “study” is that it implies that the powers-that-be must do more to eliminate what these “experts” deem “propaganda” and “junk news.” If you read deeper into the story, you discover that the researchers applied a very subjective definition of what constitutes “junk news,” i.e., information that the researchers don’t like even if it is truthful and newsworthy.</p> <p>The Post article by <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/11/27/washington-posts-fake-news-guilt/" type="external">Craig Timberg, who apparently is using Russiagate</a> to work himself off the business pages and onto the national staff, states that “The researchers defined junk news as ‘propaganda and ideologically extreme, hyperpartisan, or conspiratorial political news and information.’</p> <p>“The researchers also categorized reports from Russia and ones from WikiLeaks – which published embarrassing posts about Democrat Hillary Clinton based on a hack of her campaign chairman’s emails – as ‘polarizing political content’ for the purpose of the analysis.”</p> <p>So, this “study” lumped together “junk news” with accurate and newsworthy information, i.e., WikiLeaks’ disclosure of genuine emails that contained such valid news as the contents of Clinton’s speeches to Wall Street banks (which she was trying to hide from voters) as well as evidence of the unethical tactics used by the Democratic National Committee to sabotage Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign.</p> <p>Also dumped into the researchers’ bin of vile “disinformation” were “reports from Russia,” as if everything that comes out of Russia is, ipso facto, “junk news.”</p> <p>And, what, pray tell, is “conspiratorial political news”? I would argue that the past year of evidence-lite allegations about “Russian meddling” in the U.S. election accompanied by unsupported suspicions about “collusion” with the Trump campaign would constitute “conspiratorial political news.” Indeed, I would say that this Oxford “research” constitutes “conspiratorial political news” and that Timberg’s article qualifies as “junk news.”</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Predictable Outcome</p> <p>Given the built-in ideological bias of this “research,” it probably won’t surprise you that the report’s author, Philip N. Howard, concludes that “junk news originates from three main sources that the Oxford group has been tracking: Russian operatives, Trump supporters and activists part of the alt-right,” according to the Post.</p> <p>I suppose that since part of the “methodology” was to define “reports from Russia” as “junk news,” the appearance of “Russian operatives” shouldn’t be much of a surprise, but the whole process reeks of political bias.</p> <p>Further skewing the results, the report separated out information from “professional news organizations [and] political parties” from “some ‘junk news’ source,” according to the Post. In other words, the “researchers” believe that “professional news organizations” are inherently reliable and that outside-the-mainstream news is “junk” – despite the MSM’s long record of getting major stories wrong.</p> <p>The real “junk” is this sort of academic or NGO research that starts with a conclusion and packs a “study” in such a way as to guarantee the preordained conclusion. Or as the old saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out.”</p> <p>Yet, it’s also clear that if you generate “research” that feeds the hungry beast of Russiagate, you will find eager patrons doling out dollars and a very receptive audience in the mainstream media.</p> <p>In a place like Washington, there are scores if not hundreds of reports generated every day and only a tiny fraction get the attention of the Times, Post, CNN, etc., let alone result in published articles. But “studies” that reinforce today’s anti-Russia narrative are sure winners.</p> <p>So, if you’re setting up a new NGO or you’re an obscure academic angling for a lucrative government grant as well as some flattering coverage in the MSM, the smart play is to join the new gold rush in decrying “Russian propaganda.”</p> <p>[For more on this topic, see Consortiumnews.com’s “ <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/26/the-rise-of-the-new-mccarthyism/" type="external">The Rise of the New McCarthyism</a>”; “ <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/25/wpost-pushes-more-dubious-russia-bashing/" type="external">WPost Pushes More Dubious Russia-Bashing</a>”; “ <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/22/the-crazy-imbalance-of-russia-gate/" type="external">The Crazy Imbalance of Russiagate</a>”; and “ <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/20/more-holes-in-russia-gate-narrative/" type="external">More Holes in Russiagate Narrative.</a>”]</p> <p>By <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/tag/robert-parry/" type="external">Robert Parry</a> / Republished with permission / <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/" type="external">Consortium News</a> / <a type="internal">Report a typo</a></p> <p>This article was chosen for republication based on the interest of our readers.

	<article id="0000901" published-at="2017-09-01" title="Donald Trump: From Fake Anti-Interventionist to History’s Most Hawkish President"><p>( <a type="internal">ANTIMEDIA</a> Op-ed) — One of the reasons Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/opinion/campaign-stops/why-trumps-antiwar-message-resonates-with-white-america.html" type="external">appealed</a> to many American <a href="https://atlanticcenturion.wordpress.com/2016/10/15/why-donald-trump-is-the-anti-war-candidate/" type="external">voters</a> during the 2016 election is that much of what he promised on the campaign trail directly contradicted <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/" type="external">Hillary Clinton</a>’s record, particularly in terms of foreign policy. For example, before the election, he explicitly stated that he believed the world <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-saddam-hussein-qaddafi-us-republican-debate-primaries-430627" type="external">would have been better off had</a> the U.S. not toppled Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya (he previously did <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/05/politics/donald-trump-libya/index.html" type="external">advocate for removing Gaddafi</a> and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/donald-trump/trump-repeats-wrong-claim-he-opposed-iraq-war/" type="external">Hussein</a>but apparently hoped his support-base wouldn’t notice).</p> <p>As aptly <a type="internal">explained</a> by Anti-Media’s JP Sottile:</p> <p>“Trump never had a ‘policy’ of anti-interventionism. He was simply a troll who <a type="internal">tweeted out</a>oppositional statements attacking Obama’s foreign policy. If Obama was doing it … he was against it. He knew that no matter what, it was red meat for his future base. Then he grandstanded on Iraq to torpedo Jeb Bush. And he attacked Hillary’s militarism … because it was expedient. Go back and listen to him speaking at those rallies. The real Donald Trump is the guy who wants to ‘bomb the shit’ out of ’em and take their oil and kill their families. The real Trump is the guy who proclaimed in his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/inaugural-address" type="external">bizarre inauguration speech</a> that ‘Radical Islamic Terrorism’ was something he wanted to ‘eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.’”</p> <p>The sad truth is that after barely seven months in office, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/09/donald-trump-is-dropping-bombs-at-unprecedented-levels/" type="external">Donald Trump</a> is “the most hawkish president in modern history,” as the Council on Foreign Relation’s Micah Zenko put it. By the end of July, Trump had already dropped almost as many bombs in his first six months in office as <a type="internal">Barack Obama</a> did in the whole of 2016. As of July 31, Trump had dropped 20,650 bombs in 2017 compared to Obama’s 26,171 for all of last year.</p> <p>One should also note that the rate of bombs dropped by Obama in 2016 was <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-many-bombs-did-united-states-drop-2015" type="external">higher than in 2015</a>, and Trump is set on a path to potentially double that murderous rate. This trend in violence can be explained through Trump’s decision to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/rules-of-engagement-military-force-mattis.html?mcubz=1&amp;mtrref=www.google.ws&amp;gwh=AC6A704F37E60A4ADB6617BB2C227E13&amp;gwt=pay" type="external">empower his military generals</a> to call in airstrikes directly from the battlefield without any oversight, a move that has culminated in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-air-strike-mosul-200-civilians-killed-isis-northern-iraq-pentagon-central-command-islamic-state-a7651451.html" type="external">widespread civilian suffering</a>.</p> <p>Since July, the bombs have still been dropped at <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/raqqa-led-strikes-kill-100-civilians-48-hours-170822073525973.html" type="external">unprecedented rates</a> throughout the Middle East. The end result, as the Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/08/28/entire-families-are-being-killed-by-u-s-airstrikes-in-raqqa-syria/" type="external">reports</a>, is that entire families are being wiped out by American-taxpayer funded missiles.</p> <p>All that being said, Trump’s willingness to overuse the American military extends far beyond that of deadly air strikes. As Zenko explains:</p> <p>“Trump has also escalated U.S. military involvement in non-battlefield settings — namely Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan. In the last 193 days of the Obama presidency, there were 21 lethal counterterrorism operations across these three countries. Trump has quintupled that number, conducting at least 92 such operations in Yemen, seven in Somalia, and four in Pakistan.” [emphasis added]</p> <p>Essentially, Obama inherited two hot wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and significantly expanded operations in at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/09/america-dropped-26171-bombs-2016-obama-legacy" type="external">least five other countries</a> (six, if you <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/deadly-drone-strike-on-muslims-in-the-southern-philippines/" type="external">include the Philippines</a>). Similarly, Trump has inherited all of these wars from Obama, has radically amplified them with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/world/middleeast/us-war-footprint-grows-in-middle-east.html?mcubz=1" type="external">no real end in sight</a>, and is willing to further expand the scope of hot wars to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3534bbf6-8c96-11e7-9084-d0c17942ba93" type="external">Iran</a>, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/29/politics/north-korea-trump-kim-jong-un-rhetoric/index.html" type="external">North Korea</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/world/americas/venezuela-nicholas-maduro-military-option.html?mcubz=1" type="external">Venezuela</a>. His administration is also considering <a type="internal">wider involvement</a> in the Philippines.</p> <p>Those thinking ‘So what? Trump’s making America great again!’ need to consider how long this strategy can be implemented and what the consequences are. The U.N. is <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22015&amp;LangID=E" type="external">already issuing stark warnings</a> about U.S. activity in Syria, even directly suggesting that the U.S. is breaching international legal standards. Those standards are there for a reason; the U.S. considers breaches of international humanitarian law to be very serious crimes when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/john-kerry-russia-syria-assad.html?mcubz=1" type="external">committed by other regimes</a>.</p> <p>Although the U.S. can continue to escape criminal liability because of its superpower status, it is still unclear how these wars will come to an end given they amount to a relentlessly violent overall strategy in a host of countries that pose no threat to the United States. Weak and unstable states like Somalia and Iraq cannot directly threaten the U.S. mainland, but if the U.S. continues to exacerbate a strategy that is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/obama-drone-war-isis-recruitment-tool-air-force-whistleblowers" type="external">documented to create countless supplies</a> of terrorists in the process, then eventually, the U.S. will be looking at some very serious retaliation. Not only will the wars likely not come to an end anytime soon, the wars will be – in more ways than one – only just getting started.</p> <p>Over a decade and a half after 9/11, Americans should question a foreign policy that continues to punish civilian populations in countries that played no active role in those terror attacks. The countries that did <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/finding-discussion-and-narrative-regarding-certain-sensitive-narrative-matters-saudi-arabia-911-11-a6999091.html" type="external">play an active role</a> in attacking American civilians, <a type="internal">such as</a> Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are some of America’s closest allies.</p> <p>As Donald Trump ramps up the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/348608-pentagon-11000-us-troops-in-afghanistan-more-than-previously-reported" type="external">never-ending quagmire</a> that is Afghanistan and sword-dances his way through the Middle East <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-arms-deal-saudi-arabia-110-billion-911-terrorism-international-law-war-crimes-a7747076.html" type="external">while making billion-dollar arms deals</a> with the very country he once accused of committing 9/11, the American people need to understand that they have been hoodwinked by one of the <a href="https://time.com/4654406/america-trump-con-man/" type="external">best con men</a> on the planet.</p> <p>Trump is not an anti-interventionist — and he never was. He is also not going to save you from “radical Islamic terrorism” considering he is continuing and perpetuating the very policies that create this line of terrorism in the first place.</p> <p>Trump is not making America “great again,” nor is he any different than Bush, Clinton, and Obama. In more ways than one, Trump is arguably worse — and certainly far more hawkish.</p> <q>

Their original rationale for intervention has long been exposed as another lie.</p> <p>Remember that President Obama initially involved the US military in Iraq and Syria to “prevent genocide” of the Yazidis and promised the operation would not drift into US “boots on the ground.” That was three years ago and the US military became steadily more involved while Congress continued to dodge its Constitutional obligations. The US even built military bases in Syria despite having no permission to do so! Imagine if Syria started building military bases here in the US against our wishes.</p> <p>After six years of war the Syrian government has nearly defeated ISIS and al-Qaeda and the US-backed “moderates” turned out to be either Islamist extremists or Kurdish soldiers for hire. According to a recent report, the US has shipped two billion dollars worth of weapons to fighters in Syria via eastern Europe. Much of these weapons ended up in the hands of ISIS directly, or indirectly through “moderates” taking their weapons with them while joining ISIS or al-Qaeda.</p> <p>“Assad must go,” proclaimed President Obama back in 2011, as he claimed that the Syrian leader was committing genocide against his own people and that regime change was the only way to save Syrians. Then earlier this year, when eastern Aleppo was about to be liberated by the Syrian government, the neocons warned that Assad would move in and kill all the inhabitants. They warned that the population of eastern Aleppo would flee from the Syrian army. But something very different happened. According to the UN’s International Organization for Migration, 600,000 refugees returned to Syria by August. Half of the returnees went back to Aleppo, where we were told Assad was waiting to kill them.</p> <p>What happened? The neocons and “humanitarian interventionists” lied. Just as they lied about Libya, Iraq, and so on.</p> <p>While it was mostly ignored by the mainstream media, just this week a Christian was elected speaker of the Syrian parliament. The new speaker is a 58-year-old Orthodox Christian law graduate and member of President Assad’s Baath party.</p> <p>How many Christians does our “ally” Saudi Arabia have in its parliament? Oh I forgot, Saudi Arabia has no elected parliament.</p> <p>Why does it seem that US policy in the Middle East always hurts Christians the most? In Iraq, Christians suffered disproportionately from the 2003 US invasion. In fact there are hardly any Christians left. Why aren’t more US Christian groups demanding that the US get out of the Middle East?</p> <p>The US is not about to leave on its own. With ISIS all but defeated in Syria, many in Washington are calling for the US military to continue its illegal occupation of parts of the country to protect against Iranian influence! Of course before the US military actions in Iraq and Syria there was far less Iranian influence in the region! So US foreign interventionism is producing new problems that can only be solved by more US interventionism? The military industrial complex could not have dreamed of a better scheme to rob the American people while enriching themselves!</p> <p>What have we achieved in Syria? Nothing good.</p> <p>Op-Ed by <a href="https://ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/?author=Ron+Paul" type="external">Ron Paul</a> / Republished with permission / <a href="https://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/" type="external">RPI</a> / <a type="internal">Report a typo</a></p> <p>This article was chosen for republication based on the interest of our readers.

Right. So, the very first thing we know here, is the majority of crimes committed on BART are not by white, middle class, Tea Party types. Gotcha. What I don’t get is if you are trying to catch criminals who are robbing these trains, why in the hell wouldn’t you release the surveillance videos? There have been at least three robberies over the last three months on BART. And more before that. Gangs of young people storm the trains, rob the passengers and then take off. What does that have to do with the color of their skin? It has to do with being a CRIMINAL.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/18509/san-fran-transit-we-refuse-release-crime-amanda-prestigiacomo" type="external">This is liberal group-think.</a> There’s no logic, just political correctness and the fear of offending someone. It’s okay if someone is robbed, beaten up or even killed… just don’t offend the poor criminals, you racist pig. Both the public and the police are demanding the videos be released. It’s damned hard for the police to do their jobs and track down these thugs if they don’t know what they even look like. BART is aiding and abetting those that rob them. And yet they demand the police DO SOMETHING. SMH.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>From <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/07/11/san-franciscos-public-transit-system-withholds-crime-surveillance-videos-to-avoid-stereotypes/?utm_content=bufferb4dc9&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" type="external">TheBlaze</a>:</p> <q> <p>Authorities with San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit service are refusing to release surveillance videos of several crimes because doing so “would create a high level of racially insensitive commentary toward the district.”</p> <p>Over the last three months, there have been at least three robberies on BART trains, but footage of those crimes won’t see the light of day, if officials with the transportation service get their way, KPIX-TV <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/07/09/bart-withholding-surveillance-videos-of-crime-to-avoid-stereotypes/" type="external">reported</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497732830&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know" type="external">101 Things All Young Adults Should Know</a> by Sir John Hawkins <p>John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Can you explain?”</p> <p>Hamill replied: “If we were to regularly feed the news media video of crimes on our system that involve minority suspects, particularly when they are minors, we would certainly face questions as to why we were sensationalizing relatively minor crimes and perpetuating false stereotypes in the process.”</p> </q> <p>BART assistant general manager Kerry Hamill even went so far as to insinuate the only thing people are interested in are TV ratings and sensationalism concerning these videos. “They know that video of these events will drive clicks to their websites and viewers to their programs because people are motivated by fear,” Hamil said. You know… I don’t think that’s it dumbass. I think people are fearful of riding BART now, especially at night, because these thugs are violent and they don’t want to be robbed.</p> <p>So, let me get this straight… BART doesn’t value their passengers as much as they do the racial sentiments of criminals. Interesting. According to BART spokesman Taylor Huckaby, state law protecting “juvenile police records” bars them from releasing the surveillance footage. He added that blurring out the faces of the minors would only lead people to pointlessly watch the videos. First off, if they aren’t caught, they don’t have a police record. Second, this isn’t about voyeurism of surveillance videos… it’s about identifying and catching criminals who are hurting and robbing others. You people are just nuts and you are idiots on top of it. People will start avoiding BART and I don’t blame them. They care less about their passengers than the criminals that attack them. Sick AND twisted.</p> <a type="internal"/></article>

NY Democrat To Linda Sarsour: Where’s the $100k You Raised for Jewish Cemetery?"><p>Islamic activist and Sharia law apologist Linda Sarsour has come under a lot of fire lately. She recently faced withering criticism after she called for “Jihad” against the Trump administration and has responded to her critics time and time again by accusing them of “Islamophobia.” But now, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/07/12/democrat-linda-sarsour-wheres-100k-raised-jewish-cemetery/" type="external">she’s getting criticized by Democrats</a>, too.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Dov Hikind is a Brooklyn Democrat and a New York state assemblyman, and he slammed Sarsour for not giving money she promised to a Jewish cemetery that is in desperate need of repairs. Sarsour raised $100,000 for Golden Hill Cemetery in Lakewood, CO., but the cemetery director has said that they have not received a check, despite repeated calls.</p> <p>Sarsour joined with Tarek El-Messidi, the founder of non-profit Islamic education organization Celebrate Mercy, in February and March to raise money from the Muslim community to go towards anti-semitic attacks and vandalism after Donald Trump’s election — a noble goal, indeed. And the Muslim community responded generously. Sarsour’s original goal was a mere $20,000, but they quickly soared past that goal. And some money was given. $50,000 was given to repair two Jewish cemeteries and a synagogue that had been vandalized. But the money promised to Golden Hill Cemetery has not materialized. And Hikind has called her out for it.</p> <p>“Sarsour is a fraud,” Hikind said. “She talks out of both sides of her mouth. One minute she’s claiming to be a disciple of the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the next she’s standing with a terrorist on stage at an event [Rasmea Odeh], and singing praises of that terrorist to an audience. I won’t be the least bit surprised to hear that her little Jewish cemetery publicity stunt wasn’t quite what she made it out to be.”</p> <p>“I understood that Sarsour’s fundraiser was just a publicity stunt meant to mask her efforts to hurt the State of Israel while glorifying her terrorist pals in various Tweets and speeches,” he continued. “But I also hoped that the money she raised would at least help these cemeteries. After all, Sarsour has no loss of affection for dead Jews. But this new report raises questions about where the money went. Perhaps if this story gets out, the shame will cause Sarsour to direct the funds to the people it was promised to. Then again, shame implies an elevated sense of self-awareness, and someone who glorifies terrorists is rarely sullied by a scruple.”</p> <p>Ouch.</p> <p>Sarsour wasted no time responding on Twitter.</p> <p>She also went on a rambling Facebook rant, blaming the issue on “Zionists.” But it sounds like she’s going to need a much better excuse than that if she doesn’t pay up soon.</p></article>
	<article id="0000905" published-at="2017-09-13" title="Gatekeeper of DC Society Comes Out As Occultist, Admits Using Hex To Kill People"><p>I have never been part of high society and I have been thankful for that small blessing my entire life. I view all people as the same until they prove otherwise. That proof for a woman named Sally Quinn just surfaced and it is dark and evil. She is the widow of Ben Bradlee, the Washington Post’s powerful executive editor from 1968 to 1991, who then served as the paper’s vice president until his death in 2014.</p> <p>This power couple ruled the social scene in Washington, DC for nearly 50 years. They were hailed as the New Camelot. In fact, Bradlee had his career take off because of his friendship with John F. Kennedy. They decided who was ‘in’ and who was ‘out’, as if they were royalty and I guess in a way they were. They are the epitome of the elite… they are the very face of the Ruling Class in America. These are the people who have weaponized the media against middle America, against conservatives and Christians, against you and me.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>It turns out that Sally Quinn is an occultist. I would never have believed it, but it is evidently so. According to her own memoir, she is a witch and has murdered three innocent people by way of a hex. One was a young woman who committed suicide after flirting with Quinn’s boyfriend at the time. Another was a magazine editor who published an unflattering profile of Quinn… he died of cancer decades later. Last but not least, her last victim was a psychic who died of a cerebral hemorrhage before the end of the year after telling Quinn something she did not want to hear. I have no idea what that was.</p> <p>Now, I’m not sure I buy the whole ‘hex’ thing. But I do know the power of suggestion is very powerful. So is hatred and persecuting others you don’t like when you wield the kind of power Quinn does. Who knows? Either she’s delusional, insane and needs to be locked up, or she’s deeply evil and needs to be put down. Maybe both. The media is spinning it as her journey from atheism to magic in her quest for spirituality. I call it all kinds of wrong.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Quinn practiced the occult in the darkest ways possible into adulthood. She finally stopped, but not because she felt guilt or remorse: “She outs herself as a believer in the occult and as an erstwhile practitioner of voodoo … [and t]he book is awash in tales of Quinn’s occult prowess—she wants people to take this seriously, or at least to believe she takes this seriously. At the very least, she scared herself so badly when her third curse hit its mark—prompting a panic that her previous hexes had been karmically responsible for her son’s illness—that she vowed never to dabble in the dark arts again.” Gee, didn’t Hillary Clinton just discuss voodoo dolls and getting back at Comey, Trump and Congress for coming after her on her email scandal? What are the odds?</p> <p>Quinn also plotted to break up Bradlee’s marriage (which she did) and used the threat of adultery to bend Bradlee to her will. Just as disturbing as these actions is the way the Washington Post outs them. in the Outlook section under the matter-of-fact headline, “Sally Quinn’s hexes, marital ultimatums and visceral love of her son,” they casually tell of Quinn’s occult endeavors. The piece was written by Connie Schultz and she had an odd criticism of Quinn: “Had Sally Quinn stayed true to the promise of her book’s whimsical title, “Finding Magic: A Spiritual Memoir,” she might have led readers on a journey of self-exploration as she shared her stories of hope and the many faces of faith in the aftermath of despair.”</p> <p>This comes out and no one bats an eye over it. Call me crazy, but a powerful socialite who controls one of the biggest media outlets in the US coming out as an occultist is a bombshell. It’s discussed as casually as plastic surgery or sex. This same Ruling Class jokes about hexing President Trump as well. There has been all sorts of rumors in the media about those in DC, especially on the left, who are involved in witchcraft and occultism. Most of them I discount. But as more and more is admitted like this about Quinn, you start to wonder.</p> <p>With all the character assassination, the stoking of racial conflict, the hate campaigns, the advocating of violence, the unending cultural bigotry and the communist agendas, I find myself wondering if all that goes on among the elite goes well beyond corruption and into much darker realms. In my opinion, there is no doubt these people are evil. But coming out of the demonic closet is something else. SMH.</p></article>

Lynch Kicked Comey Out Of Room After He Exposed The Truth!"><p><a href="http://conservativetribune.com/lynch-kicked-comey-out-of-room/" type="external">Not that I trust Comey</a> as far as I can throw him, but this is interesting. Behind closed doors in Congress, he related that at one point he actually confronted Loretta Lynch over her attempts to provide cover for Hillary Clinton’s email investigation. He purportedly presented a highly sensitive piece of evidence to Lynch, who looked at the document and then looked back up at Comey with a death stare and basically told him to get out. Evidently she didn’t tolerate the truth that she had created a conflict of interest for Comey after she met with Bill Clinton on the tarmac.</p> <p>Now, I don’t view Comey as any sort of victim here. He was the head of the fricking FBI. There is no way you can convince me that he feared Loretta Lynch. A man of character certainly wouldn’t have. This was an incredibly tense meeting between Comey and Lynch. When she replaced Eric Holder, I told people she would be even worse than he was.

She was and is corrupt. Comey was dismissed from Lynch’s presence because she knew what he had shown her was the truth. In a Twitter post Tuesday, President Donald Trump weighed in on the revelation, writing, “A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes…gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!” Yes, it was. But I still don’t understand why Trump let Clinton walk as well.</p> <p>Comey has repeatedly said that Lynch tried to get him to use certain phrasing concerning the investigation into Clinton’s dealings. By the way, he’s been saying this for months. Everyone acted as though it was new during the hearing… it wasn’t. But we all knew this to be the case. The challenge is that no one did anything about it. Comey may have been bullied by Lynch, but in the end, he didn’t do the right thing. He’s lied and manipulated his way through all of this and his credibility is entirely gone. But this description of Lynch definitely has the ring of truth to it. It certainly doesn’t surprise me.</p></article>

First off, I thought this was a dude… it’s getting so hard to tell anymore. I hate boycotts, but I would say if you are going to boycott someone, start with Patagonia. They sell outdoor clothing if you can believe it. Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario had a meltdown over Trump rolling back Obama’s fascist land grabs for national monuments. Now she’s dedicating her whole company to revolting against the President of the United States. I call that subversive. She no doubt sees herself as a radical, revolutionary freedom fighter. In other words, a communist.</p> <p>This woman doesn’t believe in private land ownership. She thinks the government should control all of it. Humans to her are poison to nature. She intends to sue President Trump over it. The Trump administration is preparing to revisit Obama’s order to create the Bears Ears National Monument. In April, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review Obama’s actions on national monuments. Ordering Interior Secretary Ray Zinke to review Obama’s policies in April, President Trump called Obama’s move an “egregious abuse of federal power.” And it was. But the Marxists loved it.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>From Breitbart:</p> <q> <p>The CEO of outdoor clothing giant Patagonia is burnishing her anti-Republican bona fides again, this time saying she intends to pledge her entire company to the “resistance” of President Donald Trump.</p> <p>Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario recently attacked President Trump for his statements about rolling back President Obama’s unusually aggressive campaign of confiscating millions of acres of state lands and claiming them as “national monuments.”</p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497732830&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know" type="external"/> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497732830&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know" type="external">101 Things All Young Adults Should Know</a> by Sir John Hawkins <p>John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Along with this lawsuit, Marcario said Patagonia would use its profits to back pro-environmental candidates in states throughout the West. So, the environmental revolutionaries are on the move and I might remind everyone that they are radicals that commit terrorist acts here in the US. This is also part and parcel of the global warming cult.</p> <p>This is not the first time Patagonia has pledged its profits to leftist political movements. Just last year, they spent over $1 million for a get-out-the-vote campaign to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans. Ironic that they are acting morally superior here… they have been tied to human trafficking and child labor in their supply chain. Hypocrites.</p> <p>“Look, I grew up as a gay woman in the ‘80s, watching my friends die of AIDS and Jerry Falwell on TV saying they deserved it,” she said. She paused for a moment, then smiled. “Look how far we’ve come.” Indeed, look how far they’ve come and now they are part of the Resistance… the effort to overthrow the President of the United States.</p> <a type="internal"/></article>

The Hatch Act prohibits certain governmental employees from getting involved in political campaigns. They say any violation of law was unintended. That’s not good enough. They are a federal agency and are required to know the law. Furthermore, I don’t believe they didn’t know.

The report says 97 postal workers were granted “union leave.” Those workers took weeks off from their jobs at the postal service and were reimbursed by the National Association of Letter Carriers for their campaign work.</p> <p>“The Labor 2016 program sought to ‘elect Hillary Clinton and pro-worker candidates across the country,’” according to the OSC report.</p> </q> <p>Postal workers from North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin and Nevada took part in this. The government found out about the blatant violation of the Hatch Act when a whistleblower from Wisconsin came forward. This person contacted their congressional representatives to inform them that they thought the election was impeding the work of the US Postal Service. This prompted an investigation.</p> <p>The Hatch Act is a federal law that bars federal employees from participating in partisan activities while on the job. The purpose of the law is to ensure that federal programs are administered in a non-partisan fashion. The National Association of Letter Carriers is denying any wrong doing and says they did not violate the Hatch Act, when they obviously and knowingly did. The Senate Homeland Security &amp;amp; Governmental Affairs Committee is holding a hearing about the violations today. USPS Postmaster General Megan Brennan is scheduled to testify. Man, I hope they nail them on this. They probably won’t, but I sure hope they do.</p></article>
	<article id="0000909" published-at="2017-09-10" title="Hillary Clinton Slams Trump, Says Campaign Comforted Millions of White People [VIDEO]"><p>Major face palm. SMH. Hillary, you really need to shut it and just go walk in the woods for a few years… maybe forever. You are doing far more harm to yourself than good. Now she is saying that President Trump comforted “millions of white people” with his campaign during an interview airing Sunday on CBS. That’s right… she’s calling everyone who is white a racist. I’m sure her intent was to call Trump one, but once again… open mouth, insert hoof. “He was quite successful in referencing the nostalgia that would give hope, comfort, settle grievances, for millions of people who were upset about gains that were made by others,” Clinton leveled at Trump’s campaign.</p> <p>“What you’re saying is millions of white people,” host Jane Pauley stated. “Millions of white people,” Clinton confirmed. “Yeah, millions of white people.” Wow… way to alienate most of America in one fell swoop. That’s worse than the slur of ‘baskets of deplorables’ and I thought that was the gaff to end all gaffs. She did address that piece of stupidity as well and made it even worse. Instead of apologizing for insulting so many people, she blamed… you guessed it… Trump. She said she regretted handing Trump a political gift, but also for saying a “large number of people” didn’t care about Trump’s behavior. She still doesn’t get it. She never will.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>The interview was pre-taped yesterday. Pauley asked Clinton about her so-called ‘surprising’ defeat. No one is surprised by it except Clinton and the left, But I digress. She wanted to know what derailed Clinton’s campaign that was “supposed to make history” by electing her the first female president of the United States. In a word, Hillary. But that’s not how the Hildabeast sees it of course. She blamed it on stereotypes, sexism and misogyny. She insinuated that people were just too backward and stupid to wrap their teeny tiny brains around a woman being president. No, Hillary… it’s you, not your sex, that people couldn’t stomach.</p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497732830&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know" type="external">101 Things All Young Adults Should Know</a> by Sir John Hawkins <p>John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

She should have not kept on committing crimes and lying about them. She should have given a damn about Americans in general. But she did none of that. Then Donald Trump happened to her and she royally deserved it.</p> <p>While Hillary is promoting her book and blaming anyone and anything but herself for her loss of the presidency, the rest of America is either bored by her, amused at her stupidity or angry that no one seems interested in prosecuting this shrew. This part of the interview I found particularly ironic… Clinton did give one direct answer to Pauley’s question about things she did that cost her the election. “Oh, I think the most important of the mistakes I made was using personal email,” she said, referring to her use of a private server for official State Department business. Bwa ha ha ha ha! Ya think? She should have gone to prison for that alone, but alas, DC is covering for her yet again.</p> <p>In the closing of the interview, Hillary shows yet again that she is beyond clueless and doesn’t understand Americans at all. “I believed that it was my responsibility to try to offer answers to it, not to fan it,” she said of the public’s anger over the financial crisis. “I think, Jane, that it was a mistake because a lot of people didn’t wanna hear my plans. They wanted me to share their anger. And I should’ve done a better job of demonstrating I get it.” So, she just wasn’t angry enough. Not only does she think we are a bunch of racists and deplorables, she thinks we are unstable anger cases. That’s how little she thinks of Americans and how much she holds us in contempt y’all.</p></article>

Ever since she lost, she’s been taking potshots at Trump every chance she gets. Unfortunately for Hillary, though, she’s just proven to be the loser… again.

Hillary wasted no time boasting about this “loss” on Twitter:</p> <p>That tweet backfired on her pretty much immediately, with people pointing out that she didn’t have much of a track record to brag about herself.</p> <p>Fast-forward to today, and the Supreme Court has now allowed for the travel ban to be partially reinstated. And Trump, Jr. decided to give Hillary a taste of her own medicine:</p> <p>Ouch.</p> <p>Other people on Twitter quickly piled on:</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hillary has yet to weigh in on the decision from the Supreme Court reinstating Trump’s travel ban. Maybe she’s finally learned her lesson about celebrating a victory too early and has learned, once and for all, to keep her mouth shut, especially when it comes to trashing Donald Trump.</p></article>

A 5 year-old little Christian girl is being forced to live in a Muslim foster care home. This is happening in London. The parents of the child are totally against this and I assume are trying to get her back. The child had her cross taken away and was told that Christmas and Easter are stupid. She was also told European women are alcoholics. This is child abuse. That child should be removed from their care immediately. She’s been with them six months already and is being forced to learn Arabic.</p> <p>The child has sobbed and begged not to go back to this foster home. I don’t blame her. Both of her female caretakers covered their faces with Islamic veils when they accompanied the child out of the house. This means they are Salafi-influenced Muslims, which is a puritanical form of Islam. The first foster caretaker, who she was with for four months, wore the niqab; the one she is living with currently wears a burqa. If a Muslim child were in the system, you can bet they would only place the child with Muslims. So again I ask… why was a Christian child placed in a Muslim home like this?</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>From <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/08/28/christian-five-year-old-girl-muslim-foster-care-cross-removed-learn-arabic/" type="external">Breitbart</a>:</p> <q> <p>A white, Christian, five-year-old girl has been forced to live with Muslim foster carers who removed her cross, encouraged her to learn Arabic, and told her European women were alcoholics.</p> <p>The five-year-old girl was put into the foster care system by scandal-ridden Tower Hamlets borough council, and has spent six months in two Muslim households against the parents’ wishes, reports The Times.</p> <p>In local authority reports seen by the newspaper, a social services worker describes the sobbing child begging to not be returned to the foster home, saying “they don’t speak English”.</p> <p>Another report, which describes the girl as “very distressed”, reads that the girl was not allowed to eat a carbonara meal because it had bacon in it (forbidden in Islam), and recorded claims she had her necklace and Christian cross pendant removed by one carer, and was allegedly encouraged to learn Arabic.</p> <p>During a visit with her mother, the girl said she was told that “Christmas and Easter are stupid” and that “European women are stupid and alcoholic”.</p> </q> <p>The child should be in familiar surroundings and comforted as she is already traumatized from being separated from her parents. This is cruel and shows either a hatred of Christianity, or a stunning ignorance of religion. The Tower Hamlets borough council is known for widespread election fraud and was once controlled by Islamist-linked former mayor Lutfur Rahman, who was banned from public office for five years in April 2015 after facing allegations of rigging elections, serious corruption and using “undue spiritual influence” over voters.

Schools in this area are said to be hotbeds of Islamic extremism. This is where a Christian couple was told by a social worker that christening their infant son would lessen the chances of him being adopted. This poor little girl doesn’t stand a chance here and will be forced to become a Muslim. Britain is lost.</p></article>

Among those receiving letters were Loretta Lynch; Leonard Bernardo, the Eurasia Director of leftist billionaire George Soros’s infamous Open Societies Foundations; senior Clinton staffer Amanda Renteria and Open Society Foundations General Counsel Gail Scovell. All are now being swept up in the Senate probe.

Comey also hinted that there were further actions taken by Lynch with regard to the Clinton investigation “which I cannot talk about yet.” I would say there is an excellent chance that a number of people are going to go down over this.

	<article id="0000913" published-at="2017-10-02" title="CNN: ‘Keep In Mind, Country Music Fans Are Likely Trump Supporters’ [VIDEO]"><p>Son. Of. A. B*tch. If I despised CNN before, I detest them now. Especially Jeff Zeleny. He had the nerve to randomly point out that country music fans were probably Trump supporters. Like somehow, that makes it okay. 58 people are dead. Over 500 are hospitalized now. And this asshat is justifying it because conservatives tend to like country music and President Trump. He said this after President Trump conveyed his condolences to those in Las Vegas that were affected by this horrific tragedy. It’s the deadliest mass shooting in US history and Zeleny just couldn’t resist throwing in a political dig.</p> <p>Zeleny is a senior White House correspondent. He should have his press pass and privileges yanked over that comment. I mean that. Zeleny said he found the speech to be “pitch perfect,” but then asked people to “keep in mind” that many country music fans are Trump supporters. WTH? So, because he couldn’t find fault with the President’s speech, he attacked those that died last night. Nice touch CNN. “Something else, I think, to keep in mind–a lot of these country music supporters are likely Trump supporters,” Zeleny said. “This is something, of course, hitting the tapestry of all Americans and there are going to be victims from across the country here.”</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>I’m beyond disgusted over this. I’m still in shock this happened in Las Vegas, which by the way, is one of the greatest cities in the world. It has its drawbacks, but I love Vegas. For twenty years it was my home and I know the city inside and out. The best years of my life were spent in Vegas and my best friend still lives there. Shame on CNN… you people are a bunch of soulless ghouls. Zeleny also noted a Trump hotel in the area before saying of the President: “So, this is something I’m not surprised at all to see him go there visiting early.” What the hell does that have to do with anything? Exactly, what is this jerk saying?</p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497732830&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know" type="external"/> <p>Obviously, he was trying to demean President Trump. Dozens of people are dead on the Strip and hundreds are wounded and that’s what CNN is concerned with? Scoring cheap shots off the President? You guys are just sick and twisted.

Of course, Las Vegas is a town that he [Trump] is connected to and knows well. His name is emblazoned on the top of a hotel there as well. He campaigned there a lot. So, this is something I’m not surprised at all to see him go there visiting early. But, again, I think the moment here is what comes after this. This invariably after today and tomorrow, will become a discussion of politics, of guns. It’s not appropriate for that moment today. You will hear it from some Democrats. What will the President do in that respect? Will he take a leadership role in that respect? We will watch that as the days unfold, but the President clearly, as John said, striking a pitch-perfect tone there.</p> <p>Something else, I think, to keep in mind, a lot of these country music supporters were likely Trump supporters. This is hitting that, of course, is hitting the tapestry of all Americans and there are going to be victims from across the country here. So this is something that is a national tragedy as the President said and the flags he ordered at half staff today in memory and thought of all of the victims in Las Vegas.</p> </q></article>

Howard Schultz, the former CEO, has gone off the deep end. He tweeted: “I know we’re better than this. The bigotry, hatred, and senseless violence against people who are not white cannot stand.” But I guess, the bigotry, hared and senseless violence against white people can? Is that what he’s getting at here? Another boycott of Starbucks has now ensued. I don’t go there and never will. I don’t feel like being overcharged by communists, thank you.</p> <p>Prejudice, bigotry and hatred don’t know color. Any person who would treat another that way is a vile human being and is disgusting. We are all humans and no one is better than anyone else, just different. I don’t see Schultz decrying hatred and violence against white people or cops, do you? He hasn’t denounced the communists, Antifa or Black Lives Matter, but he’s all about going after all the evil white people. How about we knock off the racism on both sides? Get a grip America.</p> <a type="internal"/> From Young Conservatives: <q> <p>Howard Schultz, former CEO of Starbucks, now a special projects director decided to go for the full-bore offensive tweet on Saturday.</p> <q> <p>"I know we're better than this.

He said:</p> <p>“That rock represented the blood of millions who fell victim to something very similar to what we are facing now,” he said quietly.</p> </q> <p>These people have a fascist fetish and don’t realize that they are fascists themselves. Schultz insinuates that America is like the Holocaust in Nazi, Germany. Really? Actually, we didn’t have racial problems rise up again until Barack Obama came into office. Now, it is the weapon of choice for the left to bring President Trump down because the whole Russian farce didn’t pan out. What next? Aliens?</p> <p>Starbucks is an overpriced luxury that I don’t find attractive. Once they started bringing politics in the mix, they became expendable in my world.

Just say no to Starbucks.</p></article>

Some activists believe that white Americans should be forced to pay black Americans whose ancestors were slaves. It’s not something that most people take seriously, but HBO host Bill Maher <a href="https://ihavethetruth.com/2017/06/13/if-youre-white-or-people-perceive-you-as-white/" type="external">welcomed a guest who argues for exactly this</a> on his show recently.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Maher recently landed in hot water for using the n-word on his show “Real Time with Bill Maher” and he’s only just come back on the air. One of his first guests was Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson, who unsurprisingly lectured Maher about his racist slip-up.</p> <p>“That’s our word, and you can’t have it back,” Dyson told Maher, who agreed. “I did a bad thing,” Maher responded. “For black folks, that word, I don’t care who you are, has caused pain. I’m not here to do that.” The real question, of course, is how Maher still has his job, but apparently celebrities can commit any manner of sins and have them excused, as long as they’re liberals.</p> <p>Dyson seemed eager to give his forgiveness to Maher for something he did directly, but strangely, he’s not so eager to forgive every other white American for things they had nothing to do with. Dyson wants all white Americans to be forced to open bank accounts which would be used as an “individual reparations account,” with the money within given to black groups in an effort to make up for the history of slavery in America.</p> <p>Never mind the countless white Americans who fought — and died — to end slavery.</p> <p>“Look, if it doesn’t cost you anything, you’re not really engaging in change; you’re engaging in convenience,” he argued. “You’re engaged in the overflow. I’m asking you to do stuff you wouldn’t ordinarily do. I’m asking you to think more seriously and strategically about why you possess what you possess. That is what I meant by an I.R.A.: an individual reparations account.”</p> <p>So even though white Americans living today had nothing to do with slavery, they should be forced to pay reparations for it? Sure, buddy.</p> <p>Would you be willing to pay reparations to black Americans?</p></article>
	<article id="0000918" published-at="2017-10-02" title="Fmr Black Panther Takes to Social Media Calling For ACTION After Vegas Shooting ‘Our Culture Is Under Attack’ [VIDEO]"><p>Mason Weaver, a former Black Panther, did an awesome video on the shooting in Las Vegas. In it he points out that it doesn’t matter whether it was a leftist, an Islamic extremist or a communist Antifa goon. The reason this happened is because our culture has changed and he’s right. Somewhere down the road, it became acceptable to hurt others and to kill if you felt offended enough. Everything has been uber politicized and the anger is being stoked by both sides. The results are deadly as you can see in Las Vegas with 58 dead and over 500 wounded.</p> <p>We have forgotten what it means to be an American… to defend our culture and our way of life. To take pride in our country and our citizens, and yes, in our President. The killer knew he would become infamous for killing so many and probably hoped to hurt conservatives and the President by doing so. He wanted the infamy and he knew there was no way out for himself. That’s why he committed suicide before SWAT could get to him on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. As Weaver points out, this is not how we behave as Americans. And he’s also right when he says this guy didn’t just ‘snap’. This was pre-planned and well-organized. It was premeditated mass murder. He brought over ten weapons and checked into the hotel three days before the killing spree even happened. He was waiting for the perfect moment and carried out his plan meticulously.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Weaver calls this a cultural glitch in who we are as a people. Again, that is exactly right. This is the radical fringe. Think of it as a circle where the violent radicals congregate. It’s where fascists and communists meet… it’s where terrorists play. Instead of pulling together as Americans, we have Balkanized America. We have divided our country into smaller, mutually hostile groups. Now we have 28 different genders, homosexuals, African Americans, Native Americans and the list goes on and on and on. This was all part of a communist plan to tear us apart as a culture, a nation and as a society and we fell for it. Just ask an ex-Black Panther and he’ll tell you. There is no one who knows communism better than an ex-communist, or someone who knows terrorism better than an ex-terrorist.</p> <p>It’s not in fashion to be American. People try to bully Americans and shame them for being patriotic and for loving their country. They label them as racist and violent, when for the overwhelming majority, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, you almost exclusively find the violence on the left with the communists who created this mess in the first place. We’ve allowed cowardly, wimpy, pansified leftists to take over our country and teach and control our children. Shame on all of us.</p> <p>Americans know we are the freest, greatest nation on earth. Yet, we allow those who would destroy us and our way of life to control the narrative. It’s time to put all the division aside and declare that you are a proud American period. No race, no gender, no religion, no political affiliation… you are simply and greatly an American. Start acting like one.</p></article>

But how much did Obama really accomplish while president? And was it even good? According to one source, <a href="http://thefederalistpapers.org/us/a-list-of-obamas-accomplishments-as-the-first-black-president-of-the-usa" type="external">Obama’s accomplishments should make a lot of liberals rethink things</a>.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Barack Obama was the country’s first black president and so for liberals, that was all that mattered. But between 2008 and 2017, he sure did rack up a lot of accomplishments — although America’s Freedom Fighters points out that they aren’t necessarily good ones.</p> <p>Here are a few of the highlights:</p> <q> <p>First President to preside over a cut to the credit-rating of the United States. First President to violate the War Powers Act. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters. First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat. First President to order a secret amnesty program that stopped the deportation of illegal immigrants across the U.S., including those with criminal convictions. First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees. First President to tell a CEO of a major corporation (Chrysler) to resign. First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space. First President to cancel the National Day of Prayer and to say that America is no longer a Christian nation. First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present. First President to arbitrarily declare an existing law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it. First President to threaten insurance companies if they publicly spoke out on the reasons for their rate increases. First President to tell a major manufacturing company in which state it is allowed to locate a factory. First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN). First President to side with a foreign nation over one of the American 50 states (Mexico vs Arizona). First President to tell the military men and women that they should pay for their own private insurance because they “volunteered to go to war and knew the consequences.” Then he was the First President to tell the members of the military that THEY were UNPATRIOTIC for balking at the last suggestion. (Thank God he didn’t get away with THIS one.) First president to allow Iran to inspect their own facilities. First president to have blood on his hands from Benghazi to the assassinations of several police officers. First president to trade 5 terrorist for a traitor First president to facilitate the Iranians to acquire nuclear weapons.</p> </q> <p>They also pointed out that Obama has broken quite a few records, too:</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>But of course, liberals want us to believe that Donald Trump is the dangerous one. Maybe he isn’t the best president in the history of our country, but Obama’s defenders don’t exactly have much room to talk.</p></article>
	<article id="0000920" published-at="2017-08-06" title="Chelsea Clinton Tweets About ‘Moms In Prison’ — Gets Mocked On Twitter Hilariously"><a type="internal"/> <p>Last year’s <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/08/06/chelsea-clinton-tweets-about-moms-in-prison-twitter-hits-back-hard-with-hilarious-responses/" type="external">presidential election</a> was an intensely passionate divisive national event. Americans of every stripe were adamant about their preferred candidate. And many Americans were hoping one of the candidates would end up in stripes, prison stripes that is. ‘Hillary for Prison 2016’ signs and stickers graced many front yards and car bumpers. But alas, Mrs. Clinton’s misdeeds did not land her in prison, though many thought she deserved it.</p> <p>Which makes Chelsea Clinton’s recent tweet all the more awkward. See tweet below.</p> <p>No doubt Chelsea has no idea the vitriol and resentment a great many Americans bear toward her mother, for her years and years of alleged lawless deeds and never being held to account for them. But Twitter let her know in a hurry that the irony of a Clinton tweeting about moms in prison, was just too good an opportunity to ignore.</p> <p>The program Chelsea referred to in her tweet is the Girl Scouts of America’s “Girl Scouts Beyond Bars.” It enables young girls in the program to visit their incarcerated mothers, in a room that is more like a classroom instead of a typical prison visitation room. And no doubt the program is a good one that is filling a need. It has probably helped many young ladies to continue a relationship with their mother while she serves her sentence. And certainly no one faults Chelsea for supporting such a program.</p> <p>But of course any reference by Hillary’s daughter to moms in prison is going to bring a big response from Americans who are tired of seeing Democrats get away with things that other Americans would never be able to do without repercussions.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>So, to the GSA, good job on this program. It’s a benefit to young girls. But to Chelsea Clinton? There is talk of the DOJ opening investigations into Hillary’s list of questionable activities. And if there is any justice, it may be only a matter of time until you, Chelsea, have to visit your mom in prison.</p></article>

It’s either irony, or some sort of hilarious prank played by Costco, because they know her book is so full of crap.</p> <p>This is absolutely hilarious and for reasons you don’t quite understand, it will have you laughing for hours. The longer you look at it, the harder you will laugh.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>From aspirations of life in the White House to signing copies of her books next to something that belongs in an outhouse, Hillary Clinton has had a difficult year. With all of the bullcrap that comes out of her mouth, perhaps Clinton should set up a permanent residence in that aisle.</p> <p>Meanwhile, millennial protestors set up shop across the street to protest the appearance of Hillary, chanting “lock her up,” wearing MAGA hats and holding Trump campaign signs.</p> <p>Watch the video below:</p> <p>I genuinely want to feel bad for her, because to be this far along in your life and have absolutely nothing to show for it? That’s just sad. I mean, the only reason she’s even as important enough to sign books in a Costco is because she rode her husband’s coattails to fame. She’s done absolutely nothing to make a name for herself and anything she has done, such as her time as Secretary of State, has ended in abject failure and in the case of SoS, bloodshed. You can’t claim that as a success when your actions got innocent people killed when it could have been avoided.</p> <p>We are watching her decline in relevance and influence in real time, and it’s fabulous. It couldn’t be happening to a nicer witch and I’m sure the Benghazi 4 and her other victims are watching from their perches in Heaven, enjoying some great beer and watching this the way most people would watch a football game.</p> <p>I am just going to kick up my feet and watch her implode while America prospers and thrives under a Presidency that isn’t hers. This is the America that we have dreamed of during the last 8 years of the Obama administration and we’re actually here to witness it. It’s beautiful karmic justice and let’s not pretend she doesn’t deserve it. Even the left needs to recognize that she is a sinking ship and jump off like rats.</p> <p>Perhaps not the best comparison.</p></article>

Shaun White <p>Shaun White, the 2-time Olympic gold medalist and undisputed best snowboarder in history, was arrested while staying at a hotel in Nashville, TN.</p> <p>He was apparently drunk out of his mind and trashed his hotel room. When he was confronted by the hotel staff, he took off and tried getting away in a cab. A guest at the hotel who overheard everything ran after Shaun and told the driver not to move because the police were on their way. Shaun kicked the guest and took off running again.</p> <p>The guest, not wavering, chased after him and when Shaun stopped suddenly and turned around, the two crashed and Shaun’s head hit the ground hard rendering him motionless. When the cops came, Shaun was so drunk that he couldn’t sign the misdemeanor papers and forced them to arrest him. But before they could bring him to the station, he needed to make a stop at the hospital first.</p> <a type="internal"/> hot1047.com 6. Mike Tyson <p>In the early 90’s, Mike Tyson was on top of the world. He was the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history and was set to fight for his title back against the then champion, Evander Holyfield. But just months before his scheduled bout, he was arrested.</p> <p>Miss Black Rhode Island, Desiree Washington, who was 18 at the time, accused him of rape. She claimed that Tyson lured her into his hotel room, pinned her down and forced himself on her. She told him no, but he didn’t listen.</p> <p>Mike Tyson’s defense was that she knew exactly what she was signing up for as Tyson was very upfront on his intentions. Just moments after they first met, Tyson literally told her “I want to f**k you.”</p> <p>The jury ultimately found him guilty of rape and he was sentenced to 6 years in jail. After serving 3, he was released and was finally able to get his title shot against Evander Holyfield.

The gun was apparently slipping down his jeans and when he tried to bring it back up, he accidentally shot himself in his right thigh. He turned himself in 2 days later.</p> <p>The worst part is that he never had a concealed weapon license for New York and the one he had in Florida was expired; making it a felony with a minimum sentence of 3 and a half years in prison.</p> <p>Plax was suspended for the remaining 4 games of the season and missed the entire playoffs. But that was the least of his worries. The grand jury indicted him on 2 counts of criminal possession of a weapon and 1 count of reckless endangerment, all felonies. He was sentenced to 2 years in prison and did just over 20 months before being released.</p> <a type="internal"/> bet.com 8.

Apparently he racked up $37,500 in debt to Harrah’s in Las Vegas by taking credit, then writing a bad check to “pay” for it and never returning.</p> <p>The crazy part is he was released the next day, after posting $40,000 for bail… Yes, that makes sense.</p> <a type="internal"/> nbacrimelibrary.com <a type="internal"/> <p>Lawrence Taylor was charged with statutory rape when he was arrested for sexually abusing a 16 year old girl in Rockland County.

He pled guilty to sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. Instead of getting jail time, he was only sentenced to 6 years probation, but had to register himself as a sex offender.</p> <p>The worst thing out of all of this is that apparently sex with minors runs in the family.

He broke into a home to watch a woman, who worked out at the same gym as him, sleep. The kicker is that this was the second time he committed this crime.. different woman.. but the same. exact. crime.</p> <p>But apparently he has been thankful for the sentencing because his life was not heading in the right direction back then and during his time in prison, he met the love of his life.

	<article id="0000925" published-at="2017-09-20" title="REPORT: Facebook Group With Alleged Russia Ties Pushed Pro-Trump Rallies"><p>In announcing Sept. 6 that it <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/" type="external">had found $100,000</a> in ad buys from “inauthentic” accounts “likely operated out of Russia” during the 2016 campaign, Facebook said that the “vast majority of ads run by these accounts didn’t specifically reference the US presidential election, voting or a particular candidate.”</p> <p>It took <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-appear-to-use-facebook-to-push-pro-trump-flash-mobs-in-florida" type="external">the Daily Beast less than a month</a> to find what it believes to be a Russia-linked account that did, in fact, explicitly promote then-GOP candidate Donald Trump.</p> <p>The news website Tuesday surfaced the existence of a Facebook group called “Being Patriotic,” which the Daily Beast said bears many of the trademarks of other shady Facebook accounts that are believed to have had Russia ties. “Being Patriotic” went dark around the time Facebook deleted accounts linked to a Russian troll farm, according to the Daily Beast. The social media giant would not confirm to the Daily Beast the group’s Russian origins, but it did not challenge the Beast’s suggestions either.</p> <p>“Being Patriotic” pushed at least four pro-Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton rallies, according to the Daily Beast, including a flash mob that was promoted to occur simultaneously in 17 different Florida locations. In at least a few cases, those events came to fruition, according to the Beast report, and resulted in known Trump activists showing up and promoting the events on their own social media pages.</p> <p>Facebook’s disclosure of the inauthentic accounts appears to only be the tip of the iceberg of what sort of activity those accounts were involved in, per the Daily Beast:</p> <q> <p>After The Daily Beast found known Russian accounts that used Facebook’s Events tool to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-russia-used-facebook-events-to-organize-anti-immigrant-rallies-on-us-soil" type="external">promote rallies inside the United States</a>, the company said that it was <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-we-wont-reveal-if-russia-targeted-you" type="external">not well positioned</a> to determine “if something like coordination occurred” between the Trump campaign and Russia — something investigators and security researchers doubt because of the social network’s massive trove of information on its customers.</p> <p>But the discovery of the “Being Patriotic” rallies suggests that the fraudulent activity on Facebook did indeed involve messaging on behalf of Trump, did prompt at least some Americans to rally on Trump’s behalf, and did result in the Trump campaign volunteers subsequently sharing material from those events.</p> </q> <p>Russia’s use of Facebook in its alleged campaign to interfere with the 2016 election has come under major scrutiny since the disclosure of the inauthentic accounts. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe has reportedly <a type="internal">issued a search warrant</a>to learn more about the activity on the site, and the Senate Intelligence Committee has said it would like Facebook to testify publicly about what happened — a hearing chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cnn+facebook+senate+intel+october&amp;oq=cnn+facebook+senate+intel+october&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.10477j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" type="external">would like to host as early as next month.</a></p> <p>The Facebook page the Daily Beast identified Wednesday promoted flash mob events in Florida, a key swing state, in August 2016. Two of the planned locations — Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs — were sites of gatherings by Trump fans, according to photos and videos posted by Dolly Trevino Rump, the Trump campaign’s chairwoman for Broward County. Rump did not respond to the Daily Beast’s inquiries.</p> <p>Other people who were listed as contacts on Being Patriotic’s events told the Daily Beast they remembered vaguely being contacted by the group to promote the rallies. Betty Triguera, listed as a coordinator on a Sarasota event page, said she heard about the event from Being Patriotic’s Twitter account — which has also been shut down, according to the Daily Beast. Jim Frische, whose name was attached to a Clearwater event page, remembered only vague details of being contacted about the event, and that it ended up being “a dozen or so people out on the street corner.”</p></article>
	<article id="0000926" published-at="2017-08-22" title="14 Times Trump Warned Against Doing What He Just Did in Afghanistan"><p>( <a type="internal">ANTIMEDIA</a>) — On the same day millions of Americans were thrilled to witness — and equally distracted by — a total solar eclipse, Donald Trump decided it was time to announce a “dramatically different” foreign policy plan for the U.S. military in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Just how “different” is Trump’s new plan? In reality, the ‘new’ plan is simply <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-afghanistan-20170821-story.html" type="external">more of the same</a> failed policy of the past, one Trump promised to put an end to numerous times over the years prior to moving into the White House. The only difference is the childish language Trump used to justify the decision, repeatedly vowing to “win” the same conflict James Mattis <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-idUSKBN1941Y1" type="external">told</a> Congress “we are not winning” back in June.</p> <p>On Monday, August 21, 2017, Trump <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-afghanistan-report-idUSKCN1B12H7?il=0" type="external">revealed</a> to Fox News that he had signed off on sending 4,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in what is officially the <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/the-longest-war-in-american-history-has-no-end-in-sight/" type="external">longest war</a> in the history of the United States. Early Tuesday morning, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-chief-praises-trumps-afghanistan-strategy/" type="external">praised</a> Trump’s decision to commit more soldiers to fight on the ground in Afghanistan, reminding allies that NATO is fully committed to backing the ‘new’ plan:</p> <q> <p>“NATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with [U.S. Defense] Secretary [James] Mattis and our allies and international partners,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.</p> </q> <p>America’s favorite war hawk, John McCain, also praised President Trump’s strategy for Afghanistan. He <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/347425-mccain-trump-taking-big-step-in-right-direction-on-afghanistan-strategy" type="external">said</a> in a statement that he believes “the President is now moving us well beyond the prior administration’s failed strategy of merely postponing defeat,” also noting that Trump faces the challenge of keeping “the right level of effort, in the right places, with the right authorities and resources to see this conflict through to success.” He continued:</p> <q> <p>“To do this, the President must conduct himself as a wartime commander-in-chief. He must speak regularly to the American people, and to those waging this war on their behalf, about why we are fighting, why the additional sacrifices are worth it, and how we will success.”</p> </q> <p>On Fox News, Lindsey Graham <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/21/trump-afghanistan-defense-congress-241880" type="external">said</a> he was “proud” of Donald Trump’s decision:</p> <q> <p>“President Trump has the smarts and the moral courage to listen to his generals and take their advice rather than go the political way.”</p> </q> <p>Despite such fawning praise, the president is now contradicting multiple previous statements he made on the quagmire in Afghanistan. Here are 14 times Donald Trump called for the U.S. to withdraw from the war torn country on Twitter and television:</p> <q> <p>Do not allow our very stupid leaders to sign a deal that keeps us in Afghanistan through 2024-with all costs by U.S.A.

	<article id="0000927" published-at="2017-09-18" title="Happy Birthday CIA: 7 Truly Terrible Things the Agency Has Done in 70 Years"><p>( <a type="internal">ANTIMEDIA</a> Op-ed) — On Monday, President Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/909768037787717633" type="external">tweeted</a> birthday wishes to the Air Force and the CIA. Both became <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/blog/2014/histint-the-national-security-act-of-1947.html" type="external">official</a> organizations 70 years ago on September 18, 1947, with the implementation of the National Security Act of 1947.</p> <p>After spending years as a wartime intelligence agency called the Office of Strategic Services, the agency was solidified as a key player in the federal government’s operations with then-President Harry Truman’s authorization.</p> <p>In the seventy years since, the CIA has committed a wide variety of misdeeds, crimes, coups, and violence. Here are seven of the worst programs they’ve carried out (that are known to the public):</p> Toppling governments around the world — The CIA is best known for its first coup, Operation Ajax, in 1953, in which it ousted the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammed Mossadegh, reinstating the autocratic Shah, who favored western oil interests. That operation, which the CIA now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup" type="external">admits</a> to waging with British intelligence, ultimately resulted in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cia-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-2017-6" type="external">1979 revolution</a> and subsequent U.S. hostage crisis. Relations between the U.S. and Iran remain strained to this day, aptly described by the CIA-coined term “ <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/terror-blowback-burns-cia-1182087.html" type="external">blowback</a>.” <p>But the CIA has had a hand in <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/20/mapped-the-7-governments-the-u-s-has-overthrown/" type="external">toppling</a> a number of other democratically elected governments, from Guatemala (1954) and the Congo (1960) to the Dominican Republic (1961), South Vietnam (1963), Brazil (1964), and Chile (1973). The CIA has aimed to install leaders who appease American interests, often <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vf9ZJx8WkjQC&amp;q=led+by+george#v=snippet&amp;q=led%20by%20george&amp;f=false" type="external">empowering</a> oppressive, <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/cia-releases-files-that-describe-ruthless-chilean-dicta-1787899872" type="external">violent dictators</a>. This is only a partial list of countries where the CIA covertly attempted to exploit and manipulate sovereign nations’ governments.</p> Operation Paperclip — In one of the more bizarre CIA plots, the agency and other government departments employed Nazi scientists both within and outside the United States to gain an advantage over the Soviets. As <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/02/15/275877755/the-secret-operation-to-bring-nazi-scientists-to-america" type="external">summarized</a> by NPR: <p>“The aim [of Operation Paperclip] was to find and preserve German weapons, including biological and chemical agents, but American scientific intelligence officers quickly realized the weapons themselves were not enough.</p> <p>“They decided the United States needed to bring the Nazi scientists themselves to the U.S. Thus began a mission to recruit top Nazi doctors, physicists and chemists — including Wernher von Braun, who went on to design the rockets that took man to the moon.”</p> <p>They kept this plot secret, though they <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-58-no-3/operation-paperclip-the-secret-intelligence-program-to-bring-nazi-scientists-to-america.html" type="external">admitted</a> to it upon the release of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Operation-Paperclip-Intelligence-Program-Scientists/dp/0316221031" type="external">Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program That Brought Nazi Scientists To America</a> by Annie Jacobsen. In a book review, the CIA wrote that “Henry Wallace, former vice president and secretary of commerce, believed the scientists’ ideas could launch new civilian industries and produce jobs.”</p> <p>They praised the book’s historical accuracy, noting “that the Launch Operations Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, was headed by Kurt Debus, an ardent Nazi.” They acknowledged that “General Reinhard Gehlen, former head of Nazi intelligence operations against the Soviets, was hired by the US Army and later by the CIA to operate 600 ex-Nazi agents in the Soviet zone of occupied Germany.”</p> <p>Remarkably, they noted that Jacobsen “understandably questions the morality of the decision to hire Nazi SS scientists,” but praise her for pointing out that it was done to fight Soviets. They also made sure to add that the Soviets hired Nazis, too, apparently justifying their own questionable actions by citing their most loathed enemy.</p> Operation CHAOS — The FBI is widely known for its <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/more-about-fbi-spying" type="external">COINTELPRO</a> schemes to undermine <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-fbis-war-on-civil-rights-leaders" type="external">communist movements in the 1950s and anti-war, civil rights</a>, and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/g-flint-taylor/the-fbi-cointelpro-progra_b_4375527.html" type="external">black power</a> movements in the 1960s, but the CIA has not been implicated nearly as deeply because, technically, the CIA cannot legally engage in domestic spying. But that was of little concern to President Lyndon B. Johnson as opposition to the Vietnam war grew. According to former New York Times journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winner Tim Weiner, as documented in his extensive CIA <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Legacy_of_Ashes.html?id=vf9ZJx8WkjQC" type="external">history</a>, Legacy of Ashes, Johnson instructed then-CIA Director Richard Helms to break the law: <p>“In October 1967, a handful of CIA analysts joined in the first big Washington march against the war. The president regarded protesters as enemies of the state. He was convinced that the peace movement was controlled and financed by Moscow and Beijing. He wanted proof. He ordered Richard Helms to produce it.</p> <p>“Helms reminded the president that the CIA was barred from spying on Americans. He says Johnson told him: ‘I’m quite aware of that. What I want for you is to pursue this matter, and to do what is necessary to track down the foreign communists who are behind this intolerable interference in our domestic affairs…’”</p> <p>Helms obeyed. Weiner wrote:</p> <p>“In a blatant violation of his powers under the law, the director of central intelligence became a part-time secret police chief. The CIA undertook a domestic surveillance operation, code-named Chaos. It went on for almost seven years… Eleven CIA officers grew long hair, learned the jargon of the New Left, and went off to infiltrate peace groups in the United States and Europe.”</p> <p>According to Weiner, “the agency compiled a computer index of 300,000 names of American people and organizations, and extensive files on 7,200 citizens. It began working in secret with police departments all over America.” Because they could not draw a “clear distinction” between the new far left and mainstream opposition to the war, the CIA spied on every major peace organization in the country. President Johnson also wanted them to prove a connection between foreign communists and the black power movement. “The agency tried its best,” Weiner noted, ultimately noting that “the CIA never found a shred of evidence that linked the leaders of the American left or the black-power movement to foreign governments.”</p> Infiltrating the media — Over the years, the CIA has successfully gained influence in the news media, as well as popular media like film and television. Its influence over the news began almost immediately after the agency was formed. As Weiner explained, CIA Director Allen Dulles established firm ties with newspapers: <p>“Dulles kept in close touch with the men who ran the New York Times, The Washington Post, and the nation’s leading weekly magazines. He could pick up the phone and edit a breaking story, make sure an irritating foreign correspondent was yanked from the field, or hire the services of men such as Time’s Berlin bureau chief and Newsweek’s man in Tokyo.”</p> <p>He continued:</p> <p>“It was second nature for Dulles to plant stories in the press. American newsrooms were dominated by veterans of the government’s wartime propaganda branch, the Office of War Information…The men who responded to the CIA’s call included Henry Luce and his editors at Time, Life, and Fortune; popular magazines such as Parade, the Saturday Review, and Reader’s Digest; and the most powerful executives at CBS News. Dulles built a public-relations and propaganda machine that came to include more than fifty news organizations, a dozen publishing houses, and personal pledges of support from men such as Axel Springer, West Germany’s most powerful press baron.”</p> <p>The CIA’s influence had not waned by 1977 when journalist Carl Bernstein <a href="https://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php" type="external">reported</a> on publications with CIA agents in their employ, as well as “more than 400 American journalists who in the past twenty‑five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency.”</p> <p>The CIA has also successfully <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/14/thriller-ridley-scott" type="external">advised on and influenced</a> numerous television shows, <a href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0RMtCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=GBS.PT4.w.1.0.194" type="external">such as</a> Homeland and 24 and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/operation-tinseltown-how-the-cia-manipulates-hollywood/491138/" type="external">films</a> like Zero Dark Thirty and Argo, which push narratives that ultimately favor the agency. According to Tricia Jenkins, author of <a href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0RMtCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=GBS.PT5" type="external">The CIA in Hollywood: How the Agency Shapes Film &amp;amp; Television</a>, a concerted agency effort began in the 1990s to counteract negative public perceptions of the CIA, but their influence reaches back decades. In the 1950s, filmmakers produced films <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/how-cia-spooked-hollywood-movies-487064" type="external">for the CIA</a>, including the 1954 film adaptation of George Orwell’s Animal Farm.</p> <p>Researchers Tom Secker and Matthew Alford, whose work has been <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajes.12180/abstract" type="external">published</a> in the American Journal of Economics and Sociology, say their recent Freedom of Information Act requests have shown that the CIA — along with the military — have <a href="https://medium.com/insurge-intelligence/exclusive-documents-expose-direct-us-military-intelligence-influence-on-1-800-movies-and-tv-shows-36433107c307" type="external">influenced</a> over 1,800 films and television shows, many of which have nothing to do with CIA or military themes.</p> Drug-induced Mind control – In the 1950s, the CIA began experimenting with drugs to determine whether they might be useful in extracting information. As Smithsonian Magazine has <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/what-we-know-about-cias-midcentury-mind-control-project-180962836/" type="external">noted</a> of the MKUltra project: <p>“The project, which continued for more than a decade, was originally intended to make sure the United States government kept up with presumed Soviet advances in mind-control technology. It ballooned in scope and its ultimate result, among other things, was illegal drug testing on thousands of Americans.”</p> <p>Further:</p> <p>“The intent of the project was to study ‘the use of biological and chemical materials in altering human behavior,’ <a href="https://archive.org/stream/finalreportofsel01unit/finalreportofsel01unit_djvu.txt" type="external">according to</a> the official testimony of CIA director Stansfield Turner in 1977. The project was conducted in extreme secrecy, Turner said, because of ethical and legal questions surrounding the program and the negative public response that the CIA anticipated if MKUltra should become public.</p> <p>“Under MKUltra, the CIA gave itself the authority to research how drugs could:’ ‘promote the intoxicating effects of alcohol;’ ‘render the induction of hypnosis easier;’ ‘enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion;’ produce amnesia, shock and confusion; and much more. Many of these questions were investigated using unwitting test subjects, like drug-addicted prisoners, marginalized sex workers and terminal cancer patients– ‘people who could not fight back,’ <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-bOBIlg-ZOuZBHyG0L9Q0yJOEV3XcMfu6qHFIrcKw4/edit" type="external">in the words of</a> Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who introduced LSD to the CIA.”</p> <p>Further, as Weiner noted:</p> <p>“Under its auspices, seven prisoners at a federal penitentiary in Kentucky were kept high on LSD for seventy-seven consecutive days. When the CIA slipped the same drug to an army civilian employee, Frank Olson, he leaped out of the window of a New York Hotel.”</p> <p>Weiner added that senior CIA officers destroyed “almost all of the records” of the programs, but that while the “evidence that remains is fragmentary…it strongly suggests that use of secret prisons for the forcible drug-induced questioning of suspect agents went on throughout the 1950s.”</p> <p>Years later, the CIA would be accused of distributing crack-cocaine into poor black communities, though this is currently less substantiated and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/10/gary-webb-dark-alliance_n_5961748.html" type="external">supported</a> mostly by accounts of those who claim to have been involved.</p> Brutal torture tactics — More recently, the CIA was <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-most-gruesome-moments-in-the-cia-torture-report" type="external">exposed</a> for sponsoring abusive, disturbing terror tactics against detainees at prisons housing terror suspects. An extensive 2014 Senate report documented agents committing sexual abuse, forcing detainees to stand on broken legs, waterboarding them so severely it sometimes led to convulsions, and imposing forced rectal feeding, to name a few examples. Ultimately, the agency had very little actionable intelligence to show for their torture tactics but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-released" type="external">lied</a> to suggest they did, according to the torture report. Their torture tactics <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/nov/15/us-army-and-cia-may-be-guilty-of-war-crimes-afghanistan-says-icc" type="external">led</a> the International Criminal Court to suggest the CIA, along with the U.S. armed forces, could be guilty of war crimes for their abuses. Arming radicals — The CIA has a long habit of arming radical, extremist groups that view the United States as enemies. In 1979, the CIA set out to support Afghan rebels in their bid to defeat the Soviet occupation of the Middle Eastern country. As Weiner wrote, in 1979, “Prompted by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter signed a covert-action order for the CIA to provide the Afghan rebels with medical aid, money, and propaganda.” <p>As Weiner detailed later in his book:</p> <p>“The Pakistani intelligence chiefs who doled out the CIA’s guns and money favored the Afghan factions who proved themselves most capable in battle. Those factions also happened to be the most committed Islamists. No one dreamed that the holy warriors could ever turn their jihad against the United States.”</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Though some speculate the CIA directly armed Osama bin Laden, that is yet to be fully proven or admitted. What is clear is that western media <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/anti-soviet-warrior-puts-his-army-on-the-road-to-peace-the-saudi-businessman-who-recruited-mujahedin-1465715.html" type="external">revered</a> him as a valuable fighter against the Soviets, that he <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/21" type="external">arrived</a> to fight in Afghanistan in1980, and that al-Qaeda emerged from the mujahideen, who were beneficiaries of the CIA’s program. Stanford University has <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/21" type="external">noted</a> that Bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam, a prominent Palestinian cleric, “established Al Qaeda from the fighters, financial resources, and training and recruiting structures left over from the anti-Soviet war.” Much of those “structures” were provided by the agency. Intentionally or not, the CIA helped fuel the rise of the terror group.</p> <p>Weiner noted that as the CIA failed in other countries like Libya, by the late 1980s “Only the mujahideen, the Afghan holy warriors, were drawing blood and scenting victory. The CIA’s Afghan operation was now a $700-million-dollar-a-year-program” and represented 80% of the overseas budget of the clandestine services. “The CIA’s briefing books never answered the question of what would happen when a militant Islamic army defeated the godless invaders of Afghanistan,” though Tom Twetten, “the number two man in the clandestine service in the summer of 1988,” was tasked with figuring out what would happen with the Afghan rebels. “We don’t have any plan,” he concluded.</p> <p>Apparently failing to learn their lesson, the CIA adopted nearly the exact same policy in Syria decades later, arming what they called “moderate rebels” against the Assad regime. Those groups ultimately <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/syria-arming-the-rebels/transcript/" type="external">aligned</a> with al-Qaeda groups. One CIA-backed faction made headlines last year for <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-backed-moderate-rebels-behead-a-child-near-aleppo" type="external">beheading</a> a child (though President Trump cut off the CIA program in June, the military <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-cia-syria-20170719-story.html" type="external">continues</a> to align with “moderate” groups).</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this list is far from complete. The CIA has engaged in a wide variety of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/08/13/the-black-sites" type="external">extrajudicial practice</a>, and there are likely countless transgressions we have yet to learn about.</p> <p>As Donald Trump cheers the birthday of an agency he himself once <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-19/trump-will-visit-headquarters-of-cia-he-criticized-over-leaks" type="external">criticized</a>, it should be abundantly clear that the nation’s covert spy agency deserves scrutiny and skepticism — not celebration.</p></article>
	<article id="0000928" published-at="2017-12-14" title="Why Trump Should Consider a Post-Twitter Presidency">
(Reuters photo: Kevin Lamarque) <p>Almost every supposedly informed prediction about President Donald Trump’s compulsive Twitter addiction has so far proved wrong.</p> <p>He did not tweet his way out of the Republican nomination. Spontaneous social-media messaging did not lose Trump the general election race with Hillary Clinton. Nor has Trump tweeted his presidency into oblivion.</p> <p>Instead, Trump’s tweets have not just bypassed the mostly progressive media; they’ve sent it into a tizzy. In near-suicidal fashion, networks such as CNN have melted down in hatred of Trump, goaded on by Trump’s Twitter digs.</p> <p>Trump has often bragged that having a large following on social media — he has more than 44 million Twitter followers and connects with millions more via Facebook and Instagram — is “like having your own newspaper.”</p> <p>He has a point.</p> <p>While the media goes ballistic over Trump’s inflammatory Twitter attacks on “fake news,” the vast majority of Trump’s electronic messaging simply reports on his daily activities and various agendas.</p> <p>Trump has created a Twitter empire with a reach that far exceeds the combined subscriber base of the New York Times and Washington Post, and he has vastly expanded on Barack Obama’s use of a presidential Twitter feed to connect with voters.</p> <p>Almost all of the people who have climbed into the Twitter ring with Trump — from Hillary Clinton to the take-a-knee millionaire National Football League players — have come out on the losing end. Trump has proven far better than seasoned journalists and ego-driven celebrities at creating go-for-the-jugular put-downs of 240 characters or less.</p> <p>Trump’s stream-of-conscious Twitter observations have sometimes proved eerily prescient. He tweeted warnings about the dangers of illegal immigration shortly before the tragic murder of Kate Steinle by an undocumented immigrant with a lengthy criminal record. Soon after Trump retweeted incendiary and controversial videos about radical Islamic violence, earning him condemnation from British prime minister Theresa May, it was announced that two men had been arrested in London for plotting a terrorist attack and assassination — of none other than May herself.</p> <p>Why, then, should Trump ever consider pruning back his controversial tweets or confining them to the reportage of his daily achievements, in the manner of every other mostly boring politician?</p> <p>Because personal dueling with journalists, celebrities, and politicians is not only becoming superfluous, but it is now distracting Trump’s audiences from a growing record of achievement.</p> <p>Nine months ago, critics left and right were writing off Trump as an irrelevant buffoon without a clue of what to do in the White House. They predicted perennial sloth and inaction.</p> <p>Not now. Trump’s Cabinet and judicial appointments, executive orders, and deregulation measures are systematically overturning the progressive Obama project.</p> <p>Abroad, the Trump national-security team has recalibrated U.S. foreign policy from an apologetic recessional to engaged, principled realism.</p> <p>Republican politicians once grumbled about the utopian Paris climate accord but never thought of doing much about it. Trump, like him or hate him, summarily withdrew America from the agreement — and shrugged off the ensuing green outrage.</p> <p>Members of Congress occasionally expressed support for the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel — but on the expectation that no barnstorming candidate would ever dare to officially recognize Jerusalem as such if elected president.</p> <p>Prior to 2017, conventional economic wisdom dictated that the Dow Jones industrial average would not soon climb above 22,000, that the unemployment rate in peacetime could not fall to 4 percent, and that the GDP could not grow at an annual rate of 3 percent. All those shibboleths have either been blown up or may yet be blown up in 2018.</p> <p>Trump is no longer written off by the Left as a sleepy dud. Instead, he suddenly is being redefined by many of his progressive enemies as a dangerous workaholic and right-wing revolutionary.</p> <p>Never-Trump Republicans no longer insist that Trump is a liberal Manhattan wolf in conservative sheep’s clothing. Grudgingly, they now confess that he is ramming through a conservative agenda not seen since the days of their heartthrob, Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>In other words, Trump’s record speaks louder than his tweets and now transcends his electronic spats.</p> <p>So why should Trump still care what a minor journalist tweets about him to get much-needed attention? Why does the president need to keep pounding increasingly irrelevant former FBI director James Comey, who has been reduced to tweeting anti-Trump slogans?</p> <p>Trump’s record has now transcended his Twitter ankle-biters, who have become ever shriller in seeking attention in the form of electronic counter-put-downs.</p> <p>In sum, Trump has outgrown the Twitter wars. He should now just declare victory, retire as Twitter champ, hang up his tweeting gloves, and leave the slap-down ring for others.</p> <p>READ MORE:</p></article>
	<article id="0000929" published-at="2017-11-15" title="Kennedy, Clinton, and Weinstein: A Convenient Reckoning">
Bill Clinton campaigns for Hillary in Montgomery County, Pa., October 2016. (Reuters photo: Dominick Reuter) <p>Now it’s safe to denounce the worst acts of serial abusers on the left side of the aisle.</p> <p>In April, the historical drama Chappaquiddick will arrive in theaters. Variety declared the film “a tense, scrupulous, absorbingly precise and authentic piece of history — a tabloid scandal attached to a smoke-filled-room travesty.”</p> <p>The reviewer, Owen Gleiberman, suggested that the film could spur a dramatic reevaluation of the Liberal Lion of the Senate:</p> <q> <p>Ted Kennedy should, by all rights, have stood trial for involuntary manslaughter, which would likely have ended his political career. The fact that the Kennedy family — the original postwar dynasty of the one percent — possessed, and exerted, the influence to squash the case is the essence of what Chappaquiddick means. The Kennedys lived outside the law . . . those are the facts, and they are facts that liberals, too often, have been willing to shove under the carpet.</p> </q> <p>If you’re a Kennedy critic, or just fume at a famous senator enjoying the sort of legal unaccountability usually reserved for Heisman Trophy–winning USC running backs, this film will constitute a form of justice, correcting the record and tearing down the mythical façade. But it’s a rather convenient one for Ted Kennedy, as he died in 2009. Considering the ongoing reverence for the Kennedy family in so many powerful circles in this country, Chappaquiddick is a brave film. But it would have been much braver — perhaps impossible to make — a decade ago.</p> <p>If the spring brings a reevaluation of Ted Kennedy, it will probably come on the heels of a sudden and dramatic reevaluation of Bill Clinton as a consequence of the explosion of sexual-harassment and assault allegations in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. New York Times opinion columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote Tuesday:</p> <q> <p>Of the Clinton accusers, the one who haunts me is [Juanita] Broaddrick. The story she tells about Clinton recalls those we’ve heard about Weinstein. She claimed they had plans to meet in a hotel coffee shop, but at the last minute he asked to come up to her hotel room instead, where he raped her. Five witnesses said she confided in them about the assault right after it happened. It’s true that she denied the rape in an affidavit to Paula Jones’s lawyers, before changing her story when talking to federal investigators. But her explanation, that she didn’t want to go public but couldn’t lie to the F.B.I., makes sense. Put simply, I believe her.</p> </q> <p>A New York Times columnist declaring in print that she believes the 42nd president of the United States is a rapist ought to make people stop and think. But since we’re seeing a tide of slime from predatory men gradually oozing out of Hollywood studios, television networks, and state capitals, it seems fair to ask whether Clinton’s experience left many powerful and abusive men convinced that they could escape serious consequence.</p> <q> <p>It seems fair to ask whether Bill Clinton’s experience left many powerful and abusive men convinced that they could escape serious consequence.</p> </q> <p>Another New York Times columnist, David Brooks, asked a question on Charlie Rose a week ago that should leave Democrats awake at night: “How much did tolerance of Bill Clinton create the environment in which the rest of this was given permission?”</p> <p>The United States had seen infamous and widely covered allegations of sexual harassment before, most notably in the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas and the forced resignation of Oregon GOP senator Bob Packwood. But in January 1998, the Monica Lewinsky scandal set off a year-long national discussion, one that occasionally noted the mounting pile of accusations of sexual misconduct: Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones. The Clinton machine smeared the women viciously, with James Carville nastily declaring, “Drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park and you never know what you’ll find.”</p> <p>It’s worth remembering the infamous Clinton-finger-wagging moment, when he addressed a skeptical nation and vehemently denied the nature of his encounters with Lewinsky: “I did not . . . have . . . sexual . . . relations with that woman . . . Miss Lewinsky, and I never told anybody to lie.” He did so because in January 1998, admitting to even a consensual relationship with 22-year-old White House intern would have spurred bipartisan demands for his resignation. There was a time when there was a broad cultural consensus that a man in a powerful position is not supposed to look upon his female subordinates as a potential harem. And if Clinton saw Lewinsky as a sexual plaything in the workplace, it’s plausible he could have been less concerned about consent from other women in earlier years.</p> <p>A few days ago, Matt Yglesias of Vox articulated what was heresy on the Left during those years: “I wonder how much healthier a place we’d be in as a society today if Bill Clinton had resigned in shame back in 1998.”</p> <p>(One of the great ironies is that if Clinton had resigned and Al Gore had become president, Gore probably would’ve had a greater advantage in the 2000 election. Gore reportedly confronted Clinton forcefully after the 2000 recount and blamed Clinton for his defeat.)</p> <p>Was Bill Clinton a role model for how men can indulge their worst impulses and get away with it? Since the 1990s, how many men in powerful positions have seen Bill Clinton in that light? After all, all sorts of powerful people — from prominent feminists to powerful lawyers to the leaders of Clinton’s party — came to the consensus that the whole Lewinsky mess was a “private matter.” Perhaps the affair with her was — although Americans are right to expect better from a president — but the claims of Jones, Willey, and Broaddrick were not private matters in the slightest.</p> <p>After the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, Lee Smith, writing in The Weekly Standard, asked a difficult question that few Democrats will really want to confront. Would the enormously consequential New York Times article detailing the accusations about the Hollywood producer have been published if the 2016 election had ended differently and Weinstein had the president of the United States on speed-dial?</p> <q> <p>The court over which Bill Clinton once presided, a court in which Weinstein was one part jester, one part exchequer, and one part executioner, no longer exists. . . . If the story was published during the course of a Hillary Clinton presidency, it wouldn’t have really been about Harvey Weinstein. Harvey would have been seen as a proxy for the president’s husband and it would have embarrassed the president, the first female president.</p> </q> <p>We’ll never know how events would have played out in that alternative reality. Considering Weinstein’s far-reaching and ferocious efforts to discourage reporting about his abuses, it’s easy to believe that he would seek out assistance from the Clintons as the Times reporters closed in.</p> <p>Right now, we are indeed having a reckoning about a longtime blind eye to powerful men abusing women, but it’s occurring on the most convenient terms for the Democratic party — when Kennedy is dead, Bill Clinton is retired and fading into memory, Hillary’s prospects are done, and her closest network of supporters now largely live on the ash heap of American political history. Funny how all of this worked out so conveniently for the party.</p> <p>READ MORE:</p> <a type="internal">Jim Geraghty</a> — Jim Geraghty is the senior political correspondent of National Review. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/@jimgeraghty" type="external">@jimgeraghty</a></article>

The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years.”</p> <p>“They are hungry for food &amp;amp; for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!” he added.</p> <p>The protests that have spread across Iranian cities over the past four days are the largest since 2009, when the country’s disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to mass protests known as the Green Movement.</p> <p>Thousands of people were arrested during the ongoing demonstrations in 2009, and official Iranian figures state more than 30 people were killed in the clashes. Unconfirmed reports from opposition supporters suggest the death toll was more than twice the number than that of the officially recognized figure.</p> <p>At the time, then-U.S. President Obama took a cautious approach to the demonstrations in Iran, warning that the administration should not be seen as “meddling” in Iranian affairs.</p> <p>“It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran’s leaders will be,” <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/01/politics/trump-obama-iran-protests/index.html" type="external">CNN reported</a> Obama stating in June 2009. “We respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran, which sometimes the United States can be a handy political football,” he added.</p> <p>Although Obama warned against violence toward protesters, and several days after the protests broke out condemned the shooting of one demonstrator, his initial reaction was perceived by some to be slow off the mark. Others argued that by failing to back the protests, Obama avoided giving Tehran an excuse to claim they were orchestrated by the U.S.</p> <p>The recent demonstrations have seen at least 10 people killed in violent clashes that have reportedly seen riot police open fire on demonstrators.</p> <p>Hundreds of people are believed to have been arrested, while access to social media appears to have been restricted by the government. Iranian citizens have been warned they will “face the nation’s iron fist” if demonstrations continue.</p> <p>Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Saturday also accused the U.S. of being “opportunistic” in its support for demonstrators, stating: “The great Iranian nation regards the opportunist and duplicitous support of the American officials for certain gatherings over the recent days in some Iranian cities as nothing but [part of] the deceit and hypocrisy of the U.S. administration.”</p> <p>“The Iranian people attach no value to the opportunistic remarks by American officials and [President Donald] Trump himself,” he added, according to the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency, calling U.S. statements “cheap, worthless and invalid.”</p></article>
	<article id="0000931" published-at="2017-01-31" title="Gun Stories of the Week"><p>'Social Security gun grab’ to be ditched in CRA review of 'midnight regs’</p> <p>Congress this week will review and potentially repeal some of the “midnight” regulations installed during the last 60 days of the Obama Administration under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Among them: The Social Security Administration rule labeling some Supplemental Security Income and Disability (SSI) recipients as “mental defectives” and reporting them to the FBI’s gun ban database.</p> <p>Under the rule, possession of firearms by these “mentally defective” individuals — as many as 75,000 law-abiding citizens, including veterans — could be prosecuted as a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p> <p>There’s bipartisan support for removing the rule which, even the SSA has acknowledged, may be an example of regulatory over-reach exceeding intent. The poorly written rule could potentially affect anyone who receives benefits and has a representative payee who helps them manage their SSA funds.</p> <p>More than 91,000 comments were submitted on the rule, the overwhelming majority of them in opposition to it.</p> <p>NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox, in a Jan 26 press release, praised Congress’s intent to review the rule under the CRA. “Congress’ decision to review the Obama administration’s back-door gun grab is a significant step forward in protecting a fundamental constitutional right for law-abiding gun owners,” he said.</p> <p>Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-La.) said reviewing these types of “midnight” regulations” is the reason why the CRA makes sense.</p> <p>“This issue really can be boiled down to one point: No American should be denied their constitutional rights because someone else handles their finances,” Abraham told The Daily Signal in a statement. “Allowing bureaucrats at the Social Security Administration to determine whether or not beneficiaries are fit to exercise their Second Amendment rights is a clear violation of due process, and I’m pleased the Congressional Review Act will give us the opportunity to right this wrong with passage of this joint resolution.”</p> <p>For more, go to:</p> THEN THERE WERE 3 … OR 2 <p>Trump to name Supreme Court nominee to succeed Scalia on Feb. 2</p> <p>In August, Donald Trump’s campaign released a list of 21 judges from which he would select his nominee to succeed the late Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court if he won November’s Presidential election. In mid-January, President Trump announced that he would submit the name of that nominee to the Senate on Thursday, Feb. 2.</p> <p>According to numerous sources, the ultimate nominee will be one of three finalists gleaned from that list of 21 judges. They are: 11th Circuit Judge William Pryor, 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch and 3rd Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman.</p> <p>All three were appointed to the federal appellate bench by President George W. Bush, are described as Constitutional “originalists” — as Scalia was — and have met with Trump.</p> <p>On Jan. 26, Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that he has “made my decision pretty much in my mind" about which one of the three finalist he will select, but did not want tip his hand until Thursday. "That's subject to change at the last moment,” he added, “but I think this will be a great choice.”</p> <p>That same evening, Fox News’ Bill Mears, citing unnamed Trump administration sources, wrote that the short-list had been whittled down to two names — Gorsuch and Hardiman.</p> <p>Here are brief summaries of the final three, even if there are only two finalists:</p> <p>— Hardiman, 51, a University of Notre Dame graduate who received law degree from Georgetown University, he drove a taxi to pay for his college tuition and may benefit from an endorsement by Trump’s sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who sits on the 3rd Circuit Court in Philadelphia with him.</p> <p>Of the three, Hardiman has the most extensive record of pro-gun rights rulings. According to SCOTUS Blog, he dissented in a court ruling upholding a New Jersey law mandating potential gun owners show "justifiable need" to carry a handgun in public, backed a decision that said non-violent felons enjoy the Second Amendment right carry a weapon, and has written that the constitutional right "to keep and bear arms" extends beyond the home for self-protection.</p> <p>— Gorsuch, 49, graduated from Columbia University and studied law at Harvard and has a Doctorate of Legal Philosophy from Oxford University. He is the only Ivy League-educated lawyer among the final three.</p> <p>Gorsuch, whose late mother was President Ronald Reagan's EPA administrator, is notable for his "Scalia-ness,” with some legal scholars calling him as “the most natural replacement for late Justice Antonin Scalia,” according to SCOTUS Blog.</p> <p>— Pryor, 54, graduated from Northeast Louisiana University and received his law degree from Tulane University. Like Trump’s U.S. Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, he is a former Alabama State Attorney General.</p> <p>Of the three, Pryor has been the most outspoken proponent of conservative issues. While Alabama AG, he wrote a brief defending Texas’s anti-sodomy law that was later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court and he has called the Roe v. Wade ruling the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.”</p> <p>For more, go to:</p> <p>— <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/27/down-to-two-look-at-who-president-trump-might-tap-for-supreme-court.html" type="external">Down to two: A look at who President Trump might tap for the Supreme Court</a></p> <p>$10 ‘Mandatory Orwellian Device’ could thwart California ‘assault weapon’ law</p> <p>A California man has invented a simple part he hopes to sell for $10 that thwarts draconian (and blatantly unconstitutional) new “assault weapons” law.</p> <p>New gun laws in California have gun enthusiasts and companies looking for ways to make guns, like an AR-15, compliant with the law while still retaining a relatively quick and simple way to remove a magazine.</p> <p>A California law that went into effect Jan. 1 and defines “assault weapons” as any semi-automatic center fire rifle, such as an AR-15, that does not have a fixed magazine and features such as a flash suppresser and pistol grip.</p> <p>But inventor John Bastiani of Bastiani Arms says his firm has developed a product that can modify an AR so it is California compliant, while still allowing it to be disassembled quickly to take out the magazine, for $10.</p> <p>“Things that are on the market now cost upwards of $50, per gun to convert and make them legal,” he told Bob Owens of Bearingarms.com. “There needs to be a cheap solution. There might be people out there with 10 guns that they need to convert and at $50 per gun that’s cost prohibitive.”</p> <p>Bastiani and friend Mike Schroeder researched and designed parts that they could patent. Ultimately, like most good ideas, the solution was relatively simple: They replaced the bolt catch on the left side of the gun.</p> <p>“I cut some stainless steel… traced around, laid it out, cut it out with a dremel and a file, put it in the gun and said, ‘Oh my god, it actually does what I thought it would!’,” he told Owens. “We kind of lucked out because no one was thinking of the side of the gun we developed our lock for.”</p> <p>Bastiani said the part — which he has named MOD1 for “Mandatory Orwellian Device” — should only cost around $10 and would fit on any AR.</p> <p>“This is something that is legally necessary if you don’t desire to register your weapon as an assault weapon,” he told Owens. “It requires no skill at all to install.”</p> <p>Too bad uninstalling California’s “assault weapon” laws wasn’t equally as simple.</p> <p>For more, go to:</p> <p>— <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rubio-wants-to-let-guns-onto-dc-streets-why-not-let-them-into-the-capitol/2017/01/27/7a3f9ac4-e41a-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html?utm_term=.1e9a2802bbf8" type="external">Rubio wants to let guns onto D.C. streets.

	<article id="0000937" published-at="2017-07-17" title="Another Media Cover Up: Israel’s Attack on the USS Liberty">
Units of the US Sixth Fleet assist the USS Liberty after it was attacked and seriously damaged by the Israeli Air Force off the Sinai Peninsula on June 8, 1967. ( <p>The US downing of an Iranian commercial airliner in 1988, killing 290 civilians, is not the only story that our mainstream media have chosen to forget. In his recent FPJ piece (“ <a type="internal">The ‘Forgotten’ US Shootdown of Iranian Airline Flight 655</a>”), publisher and editor Jeremy R.Hammond notes that “in the rare instances when the media do mention it, to this day they tend to maintain official US government falsehoods about what occurred and otherwise omit relevant details that would inform Americans about what really happened.”</p> <p>The same can be said of the media’s treatment of Israel’s 1967 attack on the USS Liberty, which killed 34 American sailors and injured 174 more. A search of the New York Times archive reveals only two brief entries for the topic “USS Liberty.”</p> <p>A June 14, 1967 report of an LBJ press conference [six days after the attack] includes the following Q &amp;amp; A:</p> <q> <p>“Do you have any more facts you can release on the attack on the USS Liberty? A. “No, I think you know about as much about it as we do.”</p> </q> <p>Another article on June 5, 1982 refers to the attack and Israel’s apology, adding only that some survivors refuse to accept the official explanation of “mistake.”</p> <p>What could have inspired the virtual press boycott of such a major story involving American casualties?</p> <p>Believing that the 50th anniversary of the attack deserved appropriate remembrance, I emailed the following letter to editors of the New York Times, Washington Post and Guardian, US on June 5-6:</p> <p>“To the Editor,</p> <q> <p>June 8th marks the 50th anniversary of the brazen and deliberate attack by Israel on the USS Liberty, a lightly armed intelligence-gathering ship in international waters off the coast of Egypt.</p> <p>On that afternoon during the Six Day War in 1967 waves of Israeli jets attacked the Liberty without warning. A subsequent barrage from three torpedo boats nearly sank the ship, while the two attacks killed 34 American sailors and injured 174 others.</p> <p>According to Paul Craig Roberts of the Institute for Political Economy, who interviewed survivors and government officials, President Lyndon B. Johnson not only aborted an American rescue mission, but also ordered a cover-up of the whole affair. He reportedly said he “wasn’t going to embarrass an ally.”</p> <p>Notwithstanding the damning conclusions of the Moorer Commission in 2003, no subsequent US administration has dared break an apparent vow of silence.</p> <p>It’s time to honor both Liberty’s victims and remaining survivors. It’s time to tell the American people what happened on that day and why.”</p> </q> <p>None of those leading US journals included my letter above in their pages. In a June 27 email to Times Middle East correspondent Ben Hubbard, I noted that the 50th anniversary of the Israeli attacks on the USS Liberty had passed without recognition and “wondered why there was then and continuing to now no coverage by the major media.” I never received a response.</p> <p>Just as the Hammond piece broke the web of silence around the downing of the Iranian airliner, the regional Cape Cod Times newspaper fearlessly published my letter quoted above. A few days later the CCT included my second letter inviting readers who still regard the attack as an innocent mistake to view the online videos and survivor interviews.</p> <p>However, the purpose of this article is not to recount details of the attack or the differing interpretations it has generated. Interested readers can find examples of both in the more than a dozen books on the subject available on Amazon and in survivor-narrated videos available on the Internet.</p> <p>Rather, our purpose is to ask why the mainstream media continues to participate in a continuing official cover-up.</p> <p>While the New York Times and other American newspapers slept through the Liberty’s 50th anniversary and survivor events, the Israeli journal Haaretz on July11 cited a CIA document, still partly censored, that relates a conversation between an Israeli pilot and the Israeli Defense Force war room prior to the attack. The material language appears in article’s title: “‘ <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/us-news/1.800584" type="external">But Sir, It’s an American Ship.’ Never Mind, Hit Her! When Israel Attacked USS Liberty.</a>” That Haaretz published this story a week ago shows that the topic remains current fifty years on.</p> <p>The above cited FPJ article observes that “the lack of mention of the [Iranian shootdown] …illustrates an institutionalized bias in the media.” By failing to report on the Liberty affair and subsequent investigations, the New York Times and other mainstream journals have committed a similar sin of omission.</p></article>

With an estimated 8 million listeners, this long-time radio host gives encouragement to listeners who call her with their requests.</p> <p>Delilah tells people, “I love sharing my life with you as much as I love hearing about yours.” Many times she will listen to someone’s story and then choose the song she feels best speaks to their situation.</p> <p>What we all too often fail to realize though, is Delilah, and others who publically help people with their problems such as Dr. Phil, have lives of their own. They face the same day-to-day realities the rest of us do.</p> <a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/Delilah/photos/a.484768880336/10155668217315337/?type=3" type="external"/> <p>Delilah is the mother of 13 children. Her huge brood of kids is relatively unknown to her fans.</p> <p>TRENDING: <a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/l/ashleysexton/broke-mom-on-last-20-kids-pray-to-god-for-miracle-then-mom-finds-envelope-on-doorstep/" type="external">Broke Mom on Last $20, Kids Pray to God for Miracle. Then Finds Envelope with Check on Doorstep</a></p> <p>Now, instead of Delilah soothing the emotions of a distraught caller, she is in need of the same type of comfort she regularly doles out. Life has dealt her a bad hand.</p> <p>One of her children, Zachariah, <a type="internal">recently died by suicide</a>. “He was being treated, counseled, and embraced fiercely by family and friends while battling depression for some time now,” she said of her now-deceased child.</p> <a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/Delilah/photos/a.420491190336/10155874110920337/?type=3" type="external"/> My dear friends, I need to share some devastating news with you. In the early morning hours, Tuesday, October 3, my son, Zachariah, took his life. <p>There are over 1 million recorded suicides per year, but when they hit as close to home as Delilah’s son, just one of them is enough to destroy the emotional well-being of the people left behind to mourn their loss. Questions go unanswered, and though often unwarranted, feelings of guilt relentlessly invade their psyche.</p> <p>Delilah said her heart is broken beyond repair and she cannot fathom how to go on. She also believes her son is at peace and is resting with the Lord.</p> <p>Ten of Delilah’s 13 children are adopted. She lost another child, Sammy, in 2012 from sickle cell anemia.</p> <a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/Delilah/photos/a.10150774398345337/10155170410125337/?type=3" type="external"/> <p>If you are a fan of Delilah’s and have called her show concerning whatever was on your mind at the time, please remember there are sometimes people who are going through worse things than you are. This is a classic example.</p> <p>Delilah will be taking an “indefinite break from radio.” She will also be absent “on social media for a time as [she grieves and tries] to process this loss with [her] family.”</p> <p>Just as many people are experiencing, or have experienced, an insurmountable tragedy in their life, being famous does not exempt radio, television, or movie personalities from what life is going to do. Good, or bad.</p> <p>However, the strength Delilah is showing in the face of despair should be an example for all of us to follow. While this is one of the most difficult challenges she has ever had to face, life for Delilah goes on.</p> <p>We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

As <a type="internal">we’ve written before</a>, negative coverage, or even misreporting, really don’t rise to the what the understanding of what we’ve long considered to be propaganda (or “”fake news.”) Though President Trump has had some success in redefining the term.</p> <p>Enter CNN’s Jim Acosta into the White House Press Briefing today, who has held something of an inimical role to the White House communications department. Given that the Second Amendment is in the ether after Sunday night’s deadly Las Vegas shooting, Acosta challenged Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Trump’s tweet.</p> <p>Acosta opened by noting the news outlined above, stating “the president tweets this morning he’d like to see the Senate intelligence committee investigate news outlets and I guess this quest to go after fake news.” He then asked “Does he value the First Amendment as much as he values the Second Amendment?”</p> <p>Huckabee Sanders, to her credit, did not demur in her reply, saying “Absolutely. The president is an incredible advocate of the First Amendment.” She then pivoted to pointing out the <a type="internal">vast amount of negative coverage</a> that this White House has endured, saying:</p> <q> <p>We’ve seen recent information that says only 5% of media coverage has been positive about this president and this administration while at the same time you have the stock market and economic confidence at an all-time high, ISIS is on the run, unemployment at the lowest it’s been in 17 years, weave cut regulations at historic pace, fixing the VA. With you’ve only found 5% of your time to focus on those big issues. No a lot of the things you cover, not a lot of the petty palace intrigue that you spend your time on, I think we need to move towards a certainly more fair, more accurate and frankly a more responsible news media for the American people.</p> </q> <p>Sanders is citing <a type="internal">reports of negative coverage for Trump as evidence of bias</a>. But that ignores many variables, namely the shaky first nine months that the Trump administration has endured and the departure of many senior officials (Michael Flynn, Mike Dubke, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Anthony Scaramucci, etc) as well as numerous investigations, an FBI Director firing and inflammatory comments made after a deadly protest of racists and white nationalists. Again, a lack of positive coverage does not prove bias, especially for an administration that has so uniquely struggled.</p> <p>Acosta tried to go back for another follow up, but was predictably shut down by Ms. Sanders.</p> <p>Watch the clip above, courtesy of CNN.</p> <p>–image via screen capture–</p> <p>Have a tip we should know? <a href="mailto:tips@mediaite.com" type="external">tips@mediaite.com</a></p></article>

The junior Democrat senator serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and has been one of the loudest voices in advocating against the GOP’s attempts at Obamacare repeal.</p> <p>Murhpy’s full comment went as follows:</p> <q> <p>“[Trump] is literally setting the entire health care system on fire — just because the president is upset that the United States Congress won’t pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public… The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the american health care system, trying to has put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill that the American public doesn’t want us to repeal.”</p> </q> <p>The “sabotage” that Murphy mentioned is a reference to Trump cutting an Obamacare subsidy program that aimed to cut out-of-pocket charges for low-income and working class Americans. With help and advice from Senator Rand Paul, Trump made the decision to cut these subsidy payments in an attempt to allow small businesses access to the same kind of coverage as large group plans.</p> <p>However, critics — like Murphy — argue that Trump’s executive order will actually hurt the Americans that it’s designed to help, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/14/news/economy/trumps-executive-order-pre-existing-conditions/index.html" type="external">specifically</a>ones with pre-existing conditions.</p> <p>Watch above via Fox News.</p> <p>[featured image via screengrab]</p> <p>Follow Caleb Ecarma on <a href="https://twitter.com/calebecarma" type="external">Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Have a tip we should know? <a href="mailto:tips@mediaite.com" type="external">tips@mediaite.com</a></p></article>

Thank God they failed there, but they apparently didn’t think that was enough.</p> <p>They took away net neutrality, which was enforced to solve a problem that didn’t exist, and decided to give it back to the free market rather than keep it under the control of the executive branch, where it could safely be in Donald Trump’s capable, though very tiny hands.</p> <p>That should have been enough, but they were out for more blood. Despite the fact that the Republicans were warned that ending net neutrality would kill millions, enslave the LGBT community, and do untold damage to the remaining minority communities, they ended it and they still sought more.</p> <p>This brings us to the tax reform package.</p> <p>It looks like there will be a vote on Tuesday to get the conference committee’s bill through the legislative branch and quickly bring it to Trump’s desk. This bill, if passed, is set to do incredible damage to the American way of life.</p> <p>For starters, thanks to heartless robot Marco Rubio, people will be able to receive bigger tax credits for having more kids. Do you know what that means? It’s a bigger incentive to have more children. In a world that Republicans are apparently trying to destroy, it is morally reprehensible to willingly bring children into it just to save a bit on your tax note.</p> <p>What’s worse, however, is that there are cuts to business tax bills, meaning that some major companies could move back to American soil, and bring their big corporate dollars with them. More business here means more opportunities for major corporations to pollute our earth and create jobs for Americans. That means more people going to work, and their cars will only exacerbate the pollution problem.</p> <p>On top of all that, this bill repeals the individual mandate, so millions of people will die by not being forced to buy insurance, just like the GOP really intended all along.</p> <p>The Republicans have to be stopped. I think. Because according to Twitter, all of this stuff is not cool, and the Republicans are monsters.</p></article>
	<article id="0000946" published-at="2018-01-04" title="Steve Bannon’s Tactical Retreat"><p>“Soon…”</p> <p>Once a man on top of the world, Steve Bannon is now fighting for his life.</p> <p>He was President Donald Trump’s closest advisor, as well as the driving force behind the biggest and most pro-Trump outlet that isn’t Fox News. He was also a self-styled kingmaker, looking to push candidates who would fulfill the same agenda Trump’s presidency was supposed to aim for.</p> <p>However, Bannon lost the job of advisor. His outlet’s influence does not appear to be reaching as far as it used to. His candidates fail. It’s difficult to tell who fell out of love with who first, but Bannon and the White House do not appear to be in love anymore.</p> <p>I won’t re-hash all of the details, but the latest drama seems to stem from writer Michael Wolff’s unfettered access to the White House and its staff as he wrote a book on the tumultuous presidency. Some of the key quotes from the book indicate that Trump was aware of the Russian meetings. Others show Bannon insulting Ivanka’s intelligence.</p> <p>If Bannon was hoping to lay low after the complete debacle that was the Roy Moore candidacy, it looks like he’s out of luck. This story is going to get a lot of airtime, and why wouldn’t it? Trump’s closest advisor from the early days basically admitted there was something to this Russia story that keeps plaguing the administration. What will stop any media outlet from talking about that, as well as having panels talking about that.</p> <p>Bannon is not a complete dummy. His actions from the moment of Andrew Breitbart’s death were calculated to make Bannon into a political playmaker – someone who could change the face of Washington. It wasn’t an ideological urge, either. Every action he’s taken indicates he just wants to be remembered as the guy who orchestrated the cleaning of the swamp.</p> <p>It’s all blowing up in his face, however, so he’s having to sound a tactical retreat. The statements against the Trump family are designed to help him wash his hands of the Trump Administration should there be something to these Russia allegations. Looking at his website, it appears he is easing off that plan, and will instead focus on the good of the Trump Administration.</p> <p>Because, even if you were fired from the White House, you still want your contacts and pushers in D.C. helping you out.</p> <p>However, he is not fighting from a position of strength anymore. Bannon has been forced to go defensive now, and you can tell from the editorial direction at his site currently that they don’t want to fight Trump right now. There is a simple reason for that, too: They built this monster, and they know the monster will turn and consume them if they don’t watch out.</p> <p>If you’re looking for the good news, however, please note that Trump and Bannon taking swings at each other was a fantastic last-minute Christmas gift.</p></article>
	<article id="0000947" published-at="2017-12-23" title="Andrew McCabe’s Retirement Is a Chance for the FBI to Regain Its Reputation and Integrity">
Photographic evidence of Andrew McCabe engaging in an in-your-face violation of the Hatch Act. <p>Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe will take early retirement from the FBI in March, according to a report in the Washington Post.</p> <p>This is long overdue. It was obvious long before Christopher Wray was confirmed that McCabe was part of the problem and not part of the solution. McCabe is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice IG for his blatant violation of the Hatch Act. When his wife was running for a state senate seat in Virginia, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-ally-aids-campaign-of-fbi-officials-wife-1477266114" type="external">she received $675,000</a> either directly from Clinton bagman, ally, and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe or from entities over which McAuliffe exercised total control. These two things are not illegal, though for a “non-political” law enforcement official to be in this position skirts the edge of the “appearance of misconduct rule.”</p> <p><a type="internal">I posted a detailed account of McCabe’s Hatch Act violations</a>–they aren’t “gray area” violations, they are blatant “the law doesn’t apply to me” violations–back in June. In short, he used his official FBI biography as part of her effort to be selected as the preferred Democrat candidate, he appeared in her campaign literature wearing her campaign gear, he posted images of him holding supportive messages, and he used his official FBI email <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-doj-mccabe-2-production-01494-pg-24-25/" type="external">to promote his wife’s candidacy</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-doj-mccabe-ethics-01494-pg-10-11/" type="external">According to FBI documents</a>, McCabe was in charge of the Hillary Clinton email investigation from February 2016 until he recused himself on November 1, 2016.</p> <p>And, of course, as deputy director, McCabe was up to his eyebrows in the Trump dossier. As the guy running the day-to-day business of the FBI, it is impossible that the proposal to pay retired British spy Christopher Steele some $50,000 to continue his investigation escaped his notice.</p> <p>Since the firing of Peter Strzok, we’ve learned that McCabe and Strzok, on at least one occasion, spoke at some length about the presidential race, and, given the tenor of the text messages, we can presume they all talked about the necessity of Hillary Clinton winning. What makes this conversation so damning is that McCabe cleared Strzok to work on Mueller’s Russia probe.</p> <p>As I noted earlier today, <a type="internal">the FBI’s general counsel met with a reporter who was actively promoting the Trump dossier</a>.</p> <p>While there was no fire, per se, there was enough smoke and stench that it was clear that McCabe was not going to survive in the long run. McCabe’s actions, and those of a lot of other senior FBI staff, left the casual observer the option of believing he was stupid or that he just didn’t care about rules and thought he was bulletproof…or that the Deep State is real and had been accidentally revealed.</p> <p>Before his testimony this past Tuesday, <a type="internal">Trey Gowdy had this to say</a>:</p> <p>GOWDY: I’m still trying to figure out why three FBI agents are discussing politics in the deputy director’s office. Because you’re not supposed to discuss politics on federal ground and FBI agents aren’t supposed to engage in politics for Hatch Act reasons. Remember, we were supposed to interview Andy McCabe yesterday on another committee. It was all set up and ready to go, then, at the last minute, they said he can’t come Tuesday, he’s going to come next week. I’ll be shocked if he comes next week. I’ll be a little bit surprised if he’s still an employee of the FBI this time next week.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/facing-republican-attacks-fbis-deputy-director-plans-to-retire-early-next-year/2017/12/23/b4802b8c-e67a-11e7-a65d-1ac0fd7f097e_story.html?utm_term=.9dea9fb13880" type="external">Washington Post</a>, McCabe will retire in March:</p> <q> <p>Andrew McCabe, the FBI’s deputy director who has been the target of Republican critics for more than a year, plans to retire in a few months when he becomes fully eligible for pension benefits, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> </q> <p>McCabe turns 50 on May 5 and this, under the peculiarities of the federal retirement system for FBI agents, allows him to retire at full benefits (1.7% of the average of his high-three pay years, times 20). I’m assuming in March that he’ll sign out on leave and not come back.</p> <p>Of course, the anti-Trumpers who were crying in their beer over James Baker’s demotion are putting a brave face on it</p> <q> <p>A word of caution on the Andrew McCabe story. I have always assumed that McCabe would retire in March to let Wray build his own team. So I would not see this as part of any purge. The question about McCabe was always whether he would be forced out early.</p> <p>— Benjamin Wittes (@benjaminwittes) <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/944656933507739654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">December 23, 2017</a></p> </q> <p>McCabe’s ouster is a very good thing. The FBI had become highly politicized under Comey. Political loyalties drove major investigations, not the law or the evidence. Wray inherited an executive staff that was not only loyal to Comey but was hostile to the current administration. Pushing the general counsel aside and forcing the retirement of McCabe is a great chance for Wray to build his own team. A professional and non-partisan team. For a change.</p></article>

When he asked the fan if she liked Kim Chungha, she replied that she had been a fan since “Produce 101 Season 1.” She had even gone to Kim Chungha’s fan meeting and concerts. The fan also revealed that she was selling the goods not because she stopped stanning the singer, but because she needed money to study music herself.</p> <p>Kim Chungha, who had been listening hidden behind a tree, let out a sigh of relief.</p> <p>The staff then showed the fan the autographed polaroid of the artist they had prepared earlier. The fan immediately realized that the autograph was fake, questioning, “Isn’t this different from how she usually signs her autographs?”</p> <p>Kim Chungha then showed up right next to the fan, completely shocking her. The fan couldn’t hide her excitement and hugged her favorite artist repeatedly.

	<article id="0000949" published-at="2015-06-19" title="The Boy Named Jihad: From the Ashes of the Arab Spring to the Battlefields of Syria"><p>AMMAN, Jordan—Umm Jihad’s desktop background is a photo of her son Jihad smiling over his shoulder in a forest, superimposed on a sparkly pastel backdrop. “This was in Syria right before he died,” the 44-year-old mother said (she asked to be referred to as Umm Jihad, or “Mother of Jihad,” rather than by her formal name). Umm Jihad clicked on a folder labeled “Jojo” to show more pictures: Jihad leading a protest for government reform at Amman’s al-Dakhiliya circle; Jihad giving a speech at the University of Jordan; Jihad dressed in white for a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia; Jihad taking a selfie with his younger brother; Jihad with a full beard, holding a gun, wading through a stream, and waving a black flag inscribed with Jabhat al-Nusra’s white letters: “There is no God but God. Muhammad is the prophet of God.”</p> <p>The last file in her folder is an amateur diptych, two photos of Jihad in the same pose: sprawled on the floor, chest forward, arms outstretched. On the right, he’s asleep at home on a pile of books and papers, exhausted from studying for tawjihi, the Jordanian college-entrance exam. On the left, blood is pooling from the bullet holes in his bare back. He’s 20 years old, a foreign fighter in Syria, dead.</p> <p>Jihad Ghaban was one of at least 2,000 Jordanians who have joined factions in the Syrian civil war since it began in 2011, according to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/foreign-fighters-flow-to-syria/2014/10/11/3d2549fa-5195-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_graphic.html" type="external">analysts’ estimates</a>. As the war enters its fifth year, neighboring Jordan finds itself caught up in the conflict—hosting more than <a type="internal">a million refugees</a> from Syria and Iraq while participating in the <a type="internal">U.S.-led military coalition</a> against ISIS. Jordan is now <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/04/jordan-king-abdullah-views-is-syria-iraq-terrorism-coalition.html" type="external">the only Arab country</a> left in that coalition.</p> <p>Still, Jordan’s more acute fight is internal. Its stability is evidence of its strong security, as tightened borders and surveillance prevent Jordanians from joining or forming domestic cells of groups like the Islamic State. And ISIS’s filmed killing of the captured Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, broadcast in February, helped <a type="internal">shift Jordanian public opinion</a> against the Islamic extremist group. But Jordanian opposition to ISIS doesn’t necessarily indicate a broader rejection of militant jihad. Instead, many Jordanians are engaged in a debate about the boundaries and legitimacy of violent extremism.</p> <p>Umm Jihad’s son left Jordan to fight back in 2013, before the rise of ISIS and subsequent strife between militant jihadist groups in Syria. But the lack of democratic reform after the Arab Spring, along with the spread of religious extremism amid regional instability, continue to undermine many Jordanians’ belief in the country’s political leaders and religious institutions. Interpretation of Islam, and particularly the concept of jihad, is in flux, leaving an exegetical gray zone for passionate, disempowered youth like Jihad Ghaban.</p> <p>Mo’men Jaabo was 23 when he first met Jihad as a 16-year-old in 2011, the first year of the Arab Spring. Jaabo, who was a schoolteacher at the time, marched next to Jihad through downtown Amman, shouting slogans about freedom and political reform. They used to protest at al-Dakhiliya circle in the daytime, then spend nights writing graffiti in the East Amman neighborhood of Hay Nazzal, where Jihad lived. The neighborhood is poor, conservative, and mostly Palestinian, with a growing Syrian population including older people who fled the Assad government’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/01/hama-syria-massacre-1982-archive" type="external">Hama massacre</a> in the 1980s and new refugees from the latest conflict. Jaabo showed me a wall bearing Jihad’s handwriting, partially covered over with red paint but still visible: “Why does the king live in a castle while the people die of poverty?”</p> <p>A few streets away, Jaabo pointed out a large mosque overlooking Hay Nazzal’s main traffic circle. “That’s where Jihad prayed,” Jaabo said, adding that the mosque was well known for Salafi preaching that called for a fundamentalist return to Islam as practiced by the first generations of Muslims. Preachers there interpreted jihad as literal warfare in defense of the Muslim community.</p> <p>Jihad was an early participant in <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/jordans_youth_avenues_activism.pdf" type="external">Herak</a>, Jordan’s largest youth-activist movement. During the Arab Spring, its members protested weekly for democratic change, constitutional reform, and action against corruption. “All the young guys, we were full of hope that we would make lots of changes,” Jaabo said. “We saw the Egyptian revolution, Syria, Tunisia—the governments were scared. We were the strong side.”</p> Jihad Ghaban (far right) in 2012 (Mo’men Jaabo) <p>Four years later, the Jordanian government’s promised reform initiatives have largely <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/01/29/jordan-reforms-fall-short" type="external">fallen short</a> of the activists’ demands. Freedoms of expression and assembly are more limited than before the region’s uprisings, especially with expanded anti-terrorism laws that authorities can use to arrest and try dissidents in military court. Herak still exists, but as the Arab Spring gave way to chaos across the region, many of its most ardent followers became disillusioned, Jihad included.</p> <p>“When things went down after the first year in Syria, then Libya, we lost hope. It felt like our effort was nonsense,” Jaabo said. “In Jordan, we felt everyone was laughing at the youth. The government and parties were all laughing. Nobody was serious about making reform.”</p> <p>Jaabo is now 26 and works as the manager of a falafel restaurant. Other Herak members, many from more privileged backgrounds in West Amman, left to study abroad or work in Gulf countries, he said. But Jihad was still a teenager, the son of a factory worker, and struggling to afford his first year of college tuition. Aside from studying, Jihad worked in Jordan’s Sharawi chewing-gum factory. He’d get off work and cross Amman on foot to attend Herak protests, walking for hours because he couldn’t afford taxi fares. His friends nicknamed him Abu Sharawi for the gum he’d pass around every time he arrived.</p> <p>When Bashar al-Assad’s regime cracked down on Syrian protesters, Umm Jihad said, Jihad spent hours watching Al Jazeera and crying. In the middle of winter, Jaabo said, he and Jihad walked to the Syrian embassy to protest in the snow, waving Free Syria flags to demonstrate Jordanian solidarity against Assad.</p> <p>As the situation in Syria worsened and Jordan’s activists lost traction, Jihad started thinking about joining the fight. He’d ask his friends what they thought was the best way to help Syrians, said Jihad’s 22-year-old friend Laith Alawneh. “He started thinking that our fight in Jordan is not the priority,” Alawneh said. “There is no bloodshed here, but people in Syria were being killed.” In June 2013, Jihad went on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia with a group of young people from his local mosque. When he came back, Umm Jihad said, Jihad told her he wanted to spend a few days in Cairo with friends before returning to school. Jihad flew from Jordan to Egypt to Turkey. After a few days, he called his mother from the Syrian city of Aleppo and told her he’d joined Jabhat al-Nusra.</p> <p>At the time, ISIS was a <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/tracing-rise-isis-menace-terror-n214266" type="external">fairly low-profile</a> group operating as al-Qaeda in Iraq. In Syria, it had recently announced a short-lived merger with Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda’s Syrian branch and one of the most prominent rebel groups fighting the Assad regime. Nusra enjoyed considerable popular support. But it had also been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/world/middleeast/us-designates-syrian-al-nusra-front-as-terrorist-group.html" type="external">designated</a> a terrorist organization by the U.S. government.</p> <p>During his first year in Syria, Jihad worked for Jabhat al-Nusra’s media office. He had once dreamed of being a journalist; he’d interned at a community radio station in Jordan and filmed youth protests during the Arab Spring. Now he filmed Nusra fighters, spread the footage on social media, and peppered Facebook with increasingly extremist posts.</p> <p>“Jihad changed then,” Jaabo said. “I couldn’t believe the things he started to say.” In Jordan, Jihad had had friends of all stripes: Muslim Brotherhood supporters, communists, even conservatives who weren’t politically active. He’d swung across the political spectrum, considering joining the Brotherhood, then the leftist parties, but rejecting them all in the end. “The parties can’t criticize the [Jordanian] king because they are part of the system. Jihad wasn’t satisfied with this,” Jaabo said. “He’d rather be independent than compromise.”</p> <p>Jihad was religious before going to Syria, his friends and family said, but not radical. “He loved Islam,” said Alawneh, Jihad’s leftist friend. “But he was also talking to girls and going out. He wasn’t strict at all.”</p> Jihad Ghaban and his brother at home (Umm Jihad) <p>After Jihad went to Syria, he changed his Facebook profile photo from the Free Syria flag to the Jabhat al-Nusra flag. His purist tendencies took a religious bent, manifesting in his Facebook declarations that communists were kuffar, or infidels, and had to be killed. Did that mean, Jihad’s friends in Jordan wondered, that he would fight them if they were in Syria? Jihad was getting caught in an ideological and religious war, his friends told him, not a freedom fight. “Still he didn’t change his mind,” Jaabo said.</p> <p>“He’d tell us, ‘You’re not helping people. You’re in the house while people are suffering,’” said Jihad’s Syrian childhood friend Mulham al-Ahdab. He thought Jihad was being abrasive on Facebook, but then again, Syria was burning. At least Jihad was doing something. “I hate this world that stays silent while young guys like Jihad sacrifice themselves,” Ahdab said. “We all still loved him.”</p> <p>Eventually, Jihad took up arms for Nusra. In October 2014, one year and four months after entering Syria, he was shot by Syrian government forces and killed.</p> <p>From the Jordanian government’s perspective, combating extremism requires a combination of security policy—guarding the country’s borders to prevent fighters from flowing in or out of the Kingdom—and ideological persuasion. “Our strategy is to secure people’s way of thinking,” said the Ministry of the Interior spokesperson Ziad al-Zoubi. “We must support moderate ideologies before extremist ones become popular.” Jordanian authorities attempt to do so by holding dialogues and workshops with youth via civil-society organizations, Zoubi said, and by promoting moderate Islam through the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, the government entity that manages Islamic property.</p> <p>Ashraf al-Kilani, the director of the Jordanian civil-society organization Friends of National Security, said his organization recruits religious leaders, often from the state institution Dar al-Ifta, to engage young people in dissecting ISIS material and to point out why the group’s interpretation of Islam is wrong. Sometimes participants are then brought to the King Abdullah Special Operations Training Center (KASOTC), a <a type="internal">military training ground</a> in the desert outside Amman, where they meet with officials from the public-security directorate.</p> <p>“The youth are happy to have real talk with us and to meet with security officials,” Kilani said, adding that many request photos with the KASOTC officers. “We as Jordanians really adore the army, the security forces, and the king.”</p> “Our strategy is to secure people’s way of thinking,” a government spokesperson said. “We must support moderate ideologies.” <p>On the religious side, Minister of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Hayel Daoud said that there are 6,300 mosques in Jordan delivering some 5,000 Friday sermons every week. The country’s mosques are all overseen by the government, Daoud added, so every message preached on Fridays should adhere to an Awqaf-approved version of moderate Islam. “We want them to talk about mutual topics that everyone agrees on, not anything that causes division,” Daoud said. “We want topics that encourage people to live in unity and peace.” Fifty ministry employees monitor the mosques and report any preachers who stray from approved content. Since the Muath al-Kaseasbeh video in February, Daoud said, the ministry has relieved 50 preachers of their duties.</p> <p>But critics say the Jordanian government’s attempts to control the religious sphere have had a limited impact, if any at all. “I’ve never met anyone who changed his mind from extremist ideas because of someone from the Awqaf,” said the Amman-based Islamist expert Hassan Abu Hanieh. Official religious institutions lack credibility among the people, he said, because they’re seen as part of the political system. At the University of Jordan, Alawneh laughed at the idea that government monitoring could stop extremist ideas. “Awqaf stopped 50 people who support extremist ideas in the whole country?” he said. “Go walk on our campus for 10 minutes and I’ll find you 50 more.”</p> Jihad Ghaban as a freshman at the University of Jordan (Umm Jihad) <p>Fewer Jordanian youth are going to fight in Syria now than when Jihad went, Alawneh observed, but that’s not necessarily because the government has changed young people’s minds about the merits of jihad. The interpretation of jihad, a duty to literally “struggle” for Islam, is disputed. Some Muslims understand the struggle as spiritual and internal; others speak in terms of social justice, of educational, missionary, intellectual, or economic endeavor; and still others of holy warfare.</p> <p>“When Jihad died, all these Salafi guys were making speeches at his wake, saying how he was brave and martyred,” Jaabo said. “Nowadays the situation is very different with Daesh [an Arabic term for ISIS], but even so, people believe in the war in Syria. There’s no problem [with most Jordanians] if anyone goes to fight.”</p> <p>A university memorial service for Jihad was filled with youth who supported Jihad’s decision to go to Syria, according to Alawneh. “They were all praying for God to take revenge on the Shi’a and help the mujahideen,” Alawneh said, referring to Sunni rebel groups fighting the Shiite Assad regime. The reasons young people aren’t crossing the border to fight these days are often not ideological but practical: tightened security, no way of returning to Jordan, and reservations about the chaos and uncertainty in Syria.</p> “There is an extremely thin line between being a very good Muslim who follows the prophet’s rules and becoming extremist.” <p>“Jihad was brave. We are weak,” said Ahdab, explaining why he didn’t go to Syria as well. “We are creating different excuses for ourselves, but in the end we know that he is a hero and that he did the right thing.”</p> <p>Alawneh, for his part, believes waging war in Syria isn’t the best way to help the Syrian people. “Syria is a game. You have the Saudis, Turkey, Iran, America, Qatar—why would I let myself be an instrument in the hands of these people?” he said. Young fighters on every side are being manipulated in a cycle of weapons, blood, and money that only advances the political interests of the big powers, Alawneh added. “I wouldn’t join the Jordanian army and become a tool for America either.”</p> <p>Nasser Abu Abdulrahman, a 48-year-old Salafi sheikh from the conservative Jordanian town of Rusaifeh, said he wouldn’t encourage the younger generation to fight in Syria—not because doing so conflicted with his interpretation of jihad in Islam, but because of the split between jihadist groups there. “This is a time of fitnah [infighting and division among Muslims]. The mujahideen are split,” Abu Abdulrahman said, referring to the schism between ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra that first developed in the summer of 2013. It’s better for Jordanians to stay home for now, Abu Abdulrahman said, rather than exacerbate internal Islamic disunity by joining factions that are battling one another.</p> <p>Abu Abdulrahman characterized ISIS as an overly zealous group that had made serious mistakes in ideology and action, particularly in burning to death Muath al-Kaseasbeh. “But no one says that Daesh is not Muslim. We don’t call them infidels,” he said. Even if the Islamic State employs illegitimate methods of Quranic exegesis, he added, people will support the Sunni group out of desperation amid war, oppression, and suffering. “If a drunk man protects your son from being raped, you will defend [the drunk man]. He is better than others because he protected your son,” Abu Abdulrahman explained. Likewise, people suffering in Syria and Iraq, especially Sunnis, will overlook ISIS’s theological illegitimacy to support its military success, especially given the seeming lack of international will to end Syria’s war.</p> Jihad Ghaban (left) and Mo’men Jaabo protest against the Syrian regime at the Syrian embassy in Amman. (Mo’men Jaabo) <p>According to his friends, Jihad was driven to join Nusra for many of those same reasons: intolerance of injustice, frustration with international inaction, and a determination to make a difference. “Jihad was the Arab Spring personified. He wasn’t a spectator,” said Ahdab.</p> <p>“Jihad was like a white page that anyone could write on. It was easy to affect him because he was so passionate,” Alawneh noted. He had argued with Jihad about the legitimacy of extremist religious ideology. But bring up the chemical-weapons attacks, dying children, and raped women in Syria, and Jihad would cry.</p> <p>“Jihad had fire in his chest,” Umm Jihad said. She recalled the time she and Jihad passed a man beating his donkey on the street. Her son stopped and rebuked the man even though Umm Jihad insisted it was none of their business. “If that’s how he cared about donkeys, what about Syria?” she mused. “Jihad was tired from Jordan and the government. He was always talking and no one listened to him. He wanted action, not words.” Jihad went to Syria to die, Umm Jihad said, and she had no choice but to accept it.</p> <p>On the streets of Amman, bold signs in patriotic red, green, and black declare, “Raise your head, you are Jordanian.” The state’s message is clear: Jordan is one; Jordan is strong; Jordan is proud to stand against the terrorists.</p> <p>The death of the pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh has made this government message more of a reality, according to a recent <a href="http://www.jcss.org/Photos/635663460639723359.pdf" type="external">survey</a> by the Center for Strategic Studies (CSS) at the University of Jordan. In December 2014, 72 percent of respondents considered ISIS a terrorist group; in February 2015, after video of the Islamic State burning the pilot came out, that number went up to 95 percent. Meanwhile, 37 percent of respondents considered Jabhat al-Nusra a terrorist organization in December 2014 compared with 55 percent in February 2015 and 62 percent in April 2015. “Kaseasbeh changed one-fifth of the population’s opinion in two weeks,” said Walid al-Khatib, CSS’s head of public-opinion polls and surveys. “That’s more than what the government did after campaigning against ISIS for four months.”</p> <p>Still, the best way to describe how many Jordanians view Islamic extremist groups is in shades of gray, according to Khatib. “There is an extremely thin line between being a very good Muslim who follows the prophet’s rules and becoming extremist,” he explained. The government may try to convince people that it knows where these lines are, but state-affiliated voices lack legitimacy on the Jordanian street. “The government places its personal interests above religious correctness,” Abu Abdulrahman said.</p> <p>While Jordanians often trust and depend on the government to preserve national security, they are not so quick to believe its opinions on God’s will. Umm Jihad, for example, doesn’t have faith in official talk about nonviolent jihad. “Look at how barrel bombs are destroying hospitals in Syria. Look at how Muslims are being killed in Burma. Isn’t this injustice?” she asked. “Our religion is clear. If a Muslim needs help, you must go and fight for them.”</p> <p>At the same time, Umm Jihad hadn’t known Jihad was going to Syria, nor was she able to make him come back. “I want to tell you I believe he made the right decision,” she said. She’d cried and begged her son to return every time he called, despite believing that jihad is a duty and that her son’s motives were pure. “Those without much faith will say, ‘Stay here with me and don’t go.’ She with strong faith will tell her son, ‘You must go and fight,’” Umm Jihad said. “But as a mother, this is difficult. This is right, but difficult.”</p> Graffiti scrawled by Jihad Ghaban in his neighborhood reads, “Why does the king live in a castle while the people die of poverty?” (Alice Su) <p>The real conversations in Jordan on religion and the nature of jihad are happening not at state-sponsored dialogue sessions, but on the Internet and social media, according to Abu Hanieh, the expert on Islamism. He opened Facebook as an example, scrolling down his news feed through an endless stream of posts: a video message from extremists establishing the “state of Sinai,” a photo of the Islamic State creating roads in the Sinjar Mountains in Iraqi Kurdistan, congratulations for the ISIS victory in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, condemnation of Muslims being burned in Burma, and so on. “If the state wanted to silence the jihadis, they’d have to silence everyone,” Abu Hanieh said.</p> <p>Abu Hanieh noted that after the release of the Kaseasbeh video, he didn’t see many Jordanians rejecting extremist groups outright; instead, he witnessed Jordanians discussing nuanced questions about the permissibility of burning as a punishment in Islam. “The ideology of extremism has become more flexible,” Abu Hanieh said. “People are thinking about jihad more than before, and the discussions are loud, passionate, and spreading.”</p> <p>If the Jordanian government can’t fight extremism through ideological control, what can it do? The opposite, Abu Hanieh suggested: democratic reform and political opening. “Jordan is moving away from democracy in the name of combating extremism,” he said, citing state crackdowns on communists, Herak, and the Jordanian wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. “If you let the moderates back into the light, that will push the extremists to the margin.” Jihad’s friends agreed. “We need bread, freedom, and social justice,” Alawneh said.</p> <p>As a 16-year-old, Jihad had once demanded those exact things. “Jihad cared so much, but he felt like nobody was listening in Jordan,” Jaabo said. “If he had found real reform here, I think he never would have gone.”</p> <p>Reporting for this article was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.</p></article>
	<article id="0000950" published-at="2017-10-14" title="The Glaring Hypocrisy of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck’s Harvey Weinstein Statements">
Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast <p>In a damning New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories?mbid=social_twitter" type="external">report</a> published Tuesday, three women alleged that Harvey Weinstein <a type="internal">raped them</a>, and four more women cited unwanted touching from the recently ousted superproducer.</p> <p>But as the list of women accusing Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault lengthens, only a handful of powerful male celebrities have condemned the Hollywood heavyweight outright. Given Hollywood’s propensity to forgive and forget when it comes to <a type="internal">male abusers</a>—Woody Allen, Mel Gibson, and Roman Polanski, to name just a few—this is a crucial moment in which Weinstein will either be permanently cut off from the movie business or ceremoniously vanquished only to quietly resurface in a few years.</p> <p>Weinstein’s professional viability is directly tied to the A-List collaborators who have historically <a type="internal">adored him</a>. The longer celebrities remain silent on Weinstein, the more likely the story is to blow over, the disgusting allegations against the producer fading away until they’re just footnotes, his alarming history of harassment transforming back into an unspoken Hollywood secret.</p> <p>So far, women have been more likely to <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/all-the-celebrities-who-have-commented-on-harvey-weinstein.html?utm_campaign=thecut&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=s1" type="external">condemn Weinstein</a> than their male counterparts, with actresses like Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain, and Julianne Moore speaking out in support of his accusers. On Tuesday even more victims went on the record with The New York Times, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie. Both alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed them near the beginning of their careers, with Paltrow <a type="internal">recalling that</a>, “I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified.”</p> <p>While actresses like Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd have become the voices of Weinstein’s outing, there are a few men in the industry who have supported these women by amplifying their statements and issuing their own.</p> <p>George Clooney condemned Weinstein to <a type="internal">The Daily Beast</a>, calling his behavior “indefensible.” He <a type="internal">elaborated</a>, “I’ve heard rumors, and the rumors in general started back in the ’90s, and they were that certain actresses had slept with Harvey to get a role. It seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn’t get the jobs based on their talent, so I took those rumors with a grain of salt. But the other part of this, the part we’re hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn’t hear anything about that and I don’t know anyone that did. That’s a whole other level and there’s no way you can reconcile that. There’s nothing to say except that it’s indefensible.”</p> <p>Underlying every official statement and every demand for this or that A-Lister to speak out is the question of who knew what—who was truly in the dark, and who was actively covering for an abuser (or simply looking the other way). As actress Emma de Caunes told The New Yorker, “I know that everybody—I mean everybody—in Hollywood knows that it’s happening… He’s not even really hiding. I mean, the way he does it, so many people are involved and see what’s happening. But everyone’s too scared to say anything.”</p> <p>It’s entirely unfair to hound actresses for Harvey Weinstein statements or blame them for working with a man who was, by all accounts, too powerful to offend or take down. Better to focus our collective ire on powerful men who fueled the culture of silence, paving the way for Weinstein’s decades of nearly unobstructed abuse. As Jessica Chastain <a href="https://twitter.com/jes_chastain/status/917376854868332544" type="external">tweeted</a> Monday, “I’m sick of the media demanding only women speak up. What about the men? Perhaps many are afraid to look at their own behavior…”</p> <p>In a recent New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/opinion/harvey-weinstein-lena-dunham-silence-.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1" type="external">op-ed</a>, Lena Dunham wrote that, “Mr. Weinstein may be the most powerful man in Hollywood to be revealed as a predator, but he’s certainly not the only one who has been allowed to run wild… why the deafening silence, particularly from the industry’s men, when one of our own is outed as having a nasty taste for humiliating and traumatizing women?”</p> <p>Dunham <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/opinion/harvey-weinstein-lena-dunham-silence-.html?smid=tw-nytopinion&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=1" type="external">continued</a>, “The reason I am zeroing in on the men is that they have the least to lose and the most power to shift the narrative, and are probably not dealing with the same level of collective and personal trauma around these allegations. But here we are, days later, waiting for Mr. Weinstein’s most powerful collaborators to say something. Anything.”</p> <p>Dunham’s appeal for an end to male silence was retweeted by her frequent collaborator Jenni Konner, who <a href="https://twitter.com/JenniKonner/status/917525111598604289" type="external">added</a>, “A call to arms (but also a call to Matt Damon?).” Konner isn’t the first person to specifically call out Damon who, alongside Ben Affleck, got his first big break courtesy of Harvey Weinstein.</p> <p>When Weinstein’s Miramax bought the rights to 1997’s Good Will Hunting, Damon and Affleck were far from household names. With the powerful producer’s help, the beloved film went on to gross <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/02/weinstein-miramax-200402" type="external">$138 million</a>, taking home two Oscars and nine Academy Award nominations. A 2004 Vanity Fair <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/02/weinstein-miramax-200402" type="external">article</a> detailed Affleck and Damon’s bittersweet relationship with Weinstein and Miramax. “The exchange is: They’ll spend money promoting the movie, they’ll spend money on an Academy campaign, they’ll win you an Oscar, and their reputation is they make better movies. But they’re a nightmare to make a deal with,” Affleck <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/02/weinstein-miramax-200402" type="external">explained</a>, concluding, “O, yeah, we kind of got screwed, but, when it came right down to it, it worked out great for us.”</p> <p>Regarding the infamously intemperate Miramax co-chairman, Damon said <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/02/weinstein-miramax-200402" type="external">this</a>: “It’s the old tale of the scorpion and the frog. The scorpion’s sitting on the bank of a river, and a frog walks by, and the scorpion says, ‘Take me to the other side.’ The frog replies, ‘No, because when we get to the other side and you have what you want, you’re going to sting me.’ The scorpion says, ‘I would never do that. Please, I’m asking you for a favor—I can’t swim. I need your help.’ The frog finally agrees, takes him across on his back, and just as they get to the other side, the scorpion stings the frog. As the frog is dying, he says, ‘Why did you do that?’ The scorpion just looks down at him and says, ‘Because I’m a scorpion, it’s my nature.’ It’s the same with Harvey. It’s his nature.”</p> <p>As revelations about Weinstein’s alleged “nature”—predatory, exploitative, vindictive, small—continue to make headlines, Damon’s days-long silence was seen as evidence of his continued loyalty. On Monday, Rose McGowan, who reportedly received a $100,000 settlement after a hotel-room incident with Weinstein, tweeted, “Hey @Mattdamon what’s it like to be a spineless profiteer who stays silent?” McGowan also called out his Good Will Hunting pals Ben and Casey Affleck, writing, “how’s your morning boys?”</p> <p>Unlike other actors who merely worked with Weinstein, reaping in the profits and awards, Damon allegedly played a role in the culture of silence that allowed the producer to maintain his position of power. The Wrap founder Sharon Waxman says that she was working on a <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/media-enablers-harvey-weinstein-new-york-times/" type="external">story</a> for The New York Times about Weinstein’s alleged misconduct back in 2004. According to <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/damon-crowe-reportedly-helped-kill-nyt-weinstein-article.html" type="external">Vulture</a>, “Waxman alleges in The Wrap that Matt Damon and Russell Crowe called her ‘directly’ to dispel the reports she was following about Miramax’s Italian head Fabrizio Lombardo, who was allegedly hired ‘to take care of Weinstein’s women needs.’ She says that because of their influence, and interference from Weinstein, whose company was a big advertiser in the Times, the article was edited to remove the more salacious details.”</p> <p>When Damon finally did comment on the Weinstein controversy on Tuesday, it was in large part to defend himself against these accusations. The actor <a href="https://deadline.com/2017/10/matt-damon-harvey-weinstein-russell-crowe-sexual-abuse-scandal-interview-1202185574/" type="external">insisted that</a> while he did speak to Waxman at Harvey’s behest, it was only to detail his professional experience with Lombardo. “Harvey had called me and said, they’re writing a story about Fabrizio, who I knew from The Talented Mr. Ripley,” he <a href="https://deadline.com/2017/10/matt-damon-harvey-weinstein-russell-crowe-sexual-abuse-scandal-interview-1202185574/" type="external">recalled</a>. “He has organized our premiere in Italy and so I knew him in a professional capacity and I’d had dinner at his house. Harvey said, Sharon Waxman is writing a story about Fabrizio and it’s really negative. Can you just call and tell her what your experience with Fabrizio was. So I did, and that’s what I said to her…I’m sure I mentioned to her that I didn’t know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn’t. And I still don’t know anything about that and Fabrizio. My experience with him was all above board and that’s what I told her.”</p> <p>“For the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that. I just wouldn’t do that. It’s not something I would do, for anybody,” Damon <a href="https://deadline.com/2017/10/matt-damon-harvey-weinstein-russell-crowe-sexual-abuse-scandal-interview-1202185574/" type="external">continued</a>, adding, “I did five or six movies with Harvey. I never saw this. I think a lot of actors have come out and said, everybody’s saying we all knew. That’s not true. This type of predation happens behind closed doors, and out of public view. If there was ever an event that I was at and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn’t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it.”</p> <p>Ben Affleck also issued a <a type="internal">statement</a> on Tuesday, writing that, “I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass, and manipulate many women over decades… This is completely unacceptable, and I find myself asking what I can do to make sure this doesn’t happen to others. We need to do better at protecting our sisters, friends, co-workers, and daughters. We must support those who come forward, condemn this type of behavior when we see it and help ensure there are more women in positions of power.” (Affleck and Damon did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment on this story.)</p> <p>Affleck’s performative condemnation thoroughly backfired on social media. Just hours after the actor released his statement, a Twitter user wrote, “He also grabbed [One Tree Hill actress] Hilarie Burton’s breasts on TRL once. Everyone forgot though.” Burton herself quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/HilarieBurton/status/917927823674953728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fben-affleck-is-accused-of-groping-actress-hilarie-burton" type="external">jumped in</a> to confirm the incident, responding, “I didn’t forget.” She then tweeted an outtakes clip from her TRL appearance, in which she appears to reference Affleck’s groping, saying, “He comes over and tweaks my left boob.” Burton recalled, “I had to laugh back then so I wouldn’t cry.” She was 21 years old at the time.</p> <p>Rose McGowan also responded to Affleck on Tuesday, seemingly asserting that the actor knew more than he’s letting on: “‘GODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT’ you said that to my face. The press conf I was made to go to after assault. You lie.” She later added “Ben Affleck fuck off.” McGowan and Affleck co-starred in the 1998 film Phantoms, which was released by Weinstein’s Miramax one year after an alleged incident with Weinstein and McGowan at a hotel suite during the Sundance Film Festival resulted in the aforementioned financial settlement.</p> <p>Damon and Affleck’s statements feel disingenuous, and not just because they waited days to issue them, finally speaking out when the pressure to do so (from both the public and their peers) became unbearable. Both of the actors purport to support victims and condemn abusers. Affleck’s statement in particular is focused around the concept of doing more, with the star seemingly challenging himself to work toward dismantling the systems of power that elevate abusers and silence their victims. One wonders where Ben Affleck, male ally, was back in 2016, when he was a major player in his brother Casey Affleck’s Oscar campaign.</p> <p>As Lainey Gossip’s Lainey Lui <a href="http://www.laineygossip.com/Ben-Affleck--Matt-Damon-mobilise-behind-Casey-Affleck-at-LA-premiere-of-Manchester-By-The-Sea-to-help-him-campaign-for-Oscar/45487" type="external">pointed out</a> at the time, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were incredibly visible during the campaign, posing as a trio with Casey at premieres as the Best Actor race heated up. Damon, who produced Manchester by the Sea, praised its star in multiple interviews, <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/casey-affleck-manchester-by-the-sea-1201891603/" type="external">calling Casey</a> “one of the best actors I’ve ever met”—someone “I grew up with and loved dearly.” In an <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/11/why-the-casey-affleck-sex-harassment-allegations-wont-stick.html" type="external">article</a> for The Cut, Allie Jones proposed that it was Casey’s proximity to these A-List stars that protected his career after 2010 sexual harassment allegations resurfaced. “Luckiest for Affleck, he is the brother of a major movie star and the childhood friend of another,” Jones <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/11/why-the-casey-affleck-sex-harassment-allegations-wont-stick.html" type="external">wrote</a>. “This brotherly posing makes prestige outlets hesitant to ask the younger Affleck tough questions, for fear of losing access to all three stars. His cruise to the Oscars continues undeterred because of his privileged position in Hollywood.”</p> <p>As The Daily Beast previously reported, two women who worked with Affleck on the set of his documentary I’m Still Here <a type="internal">alleged</a> that they were subject to a spectrum of unprofessional behavior, ranging from verbal harassment and inappropriate comments to unwanted touching and physical intimidation. The film’s director of photography Magdalena Gorka <a type="internal">described</a> the experience as “the most traumatizing of her career.” According to Gorka’s <a type="internal">complaint</a>, she was staying with other crewmembers in New York for a shoot one night when she was woken up by Affleck’s presence. She <a type="internal">alleged that</a> the actor was, “curled up next to her in the bed wearing only his underwear and a T-shirt. He had his arm around her, was caressing her back, his face was within inches of hers and his breath reeked of alcohol.” When Gorka ordered her married boss to leave, Affleck <a type="internal">allegedly responded</a>, “Why?” and then asked if she was “sure.”</p> <p>Producer Amanda White also sued Affleck with <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/Entertainment/White%20Complaint.pdf" type="external">similar claims</a>. As The Daily Beast <a type="internal">reported</a>, “[White] described an instance where she was prevented from returning to her bedroom during shooting, because Affleck and Phoenix had locked themselves in her room with two women where they had sex with them [Affleck was married with two children to Phoenix’s sister, Summer, at the time—though the couple recently split]. She also alleged that Affleck attempted to manipulate her into sharing a hotel room with him. When she resisted, White claimed, he grabbed her threateningly and attempted to scare her into submission.” Both White and Gorka’s <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/Entertainment/Gorka_complaint.pdf" type="external">lawsuits</a> ultimately ended in settlements.</p> <p>After a slew of fawning profiles and rave reviews, Affleck won an Oscar for Best Actor, proving once again that allegedly abusing women does not <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/casey-affleck-oscar-win-affirmed-that-harassing-women-isnt-disqualifying_us_58b3c336e4b0a8a9b783abc1" type="external">disqualify men</a> from the entertainment industry’s highest honor.</p> <p>Harvey Weinstein and Casey Affleck are not the same, but they’ve both benefited from the same system: one in which powerful men protect other powerful men, and reporters are pressured not to publish certain stories or ask certain questions. Casey Affleck’s career flourished even after two women came forward to accuse him of sexual harassment. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon actively threw their support behind him, and it’s safe to say that that A-list backing helped accelerate the collective amnesia that allowed Hollywood to forgive Casey’s alleged misconduct. After Casey Affleck <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/casey-affleck-manchester-by-the-sea-1201891603/" type="external">seemingly dismissed</a> the claims against him, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon testified to his talent and stood beside him literally and figuratively, all but ensuring that Casey’s career would continue along its upward trajectory.</p> <p>It seems like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon take no issue with the culture of silence when it is convenient to them, and are quick to harness their power in order to protect family and friends. But when it is no longer permissible to be associated with a known abuser, they distance themselves with vague statements, performing disgust and horror, evoking their wives and daughters. Condemning Weinstein now that he is too toxic to collaborate with does not an ally make; particularly when we’re dealing with men like Damon and Affleck who have historically aided alleged abusers and worked to preserve their Teflon reputations.</p></article>

NBC <p>Steve Bannon will be stepping down as Chairman and CEO of Breitbart News, days after he suffered a stunning backlash for his comments in Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.”</p> <p>“I’m proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform,” said Bannon in a terse statement first reported on <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/09/stephen-k-bannon-steps-breitbart-news-network/" type="external">Breitbart Tuesday.</a></p> <p>The former White House chief strategist blasted Donald Trump Jr’s meeting with a Russian lawyer as “treasonous” in the Wolff book, but later backtracked by saying he was not criticizing the president’s son, and was actually <a type="internal">criticizing the political insiders</a>, including Paul Manafort, who allowed him to take the meeting.</p> <p><a type="internal">Steve Bannon Responds to 'Fire and Fury,' Says Support of Trump is 'Unwavering'</a></p> <p>The backtracking didn’t work. Key allies have abandoned Bannon, including Breitbart backer Rebekah Mercer, whose family also supported Trump’s presidential campaign. President Trump has not amended a blistering denunciation of Bannon, his former confidant and campaign manager.</p> <p>Despite Bannon’s departure, former Breitbart spokesperson Kurt Bardella said it probably would not be the last we heard of him. He said Bannon — who Trump detractors sometimes called “President Bannon” because of his influence — has even considered his own political career.</p> <p>“I don’t think he’ll be quiet or silent for very long. Acceptance fate or defeat is not in his DNA,” Bardella told TheWrap. “Someone who entertains running for president doesn’t just retreat and shrink away into anonymity. He will try and reinvent himself. He will try and finish what he started.”</p> <p>“I’m very surprised,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who speaks with Bannon regularly. “I thought everything subsided after the weekend.”</p> <p>Former Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos told TheWrap that people lacing into Bannon now were “hypocrites,” and he too predicted another act.</p> <p>“The people knifing Steve now are cowards and hypocrites,” said Yiannopoulos. “They were perfectly happy to suck up to him when he had the President’s ear. Steve is one of the most brilliant political operatives of his generation. You’re a fool if you think this is anything but the opening of his next chapter.”</p> <p>Breitbart CEO Larry Solov, praised the outgoing newsroom chief.</p> <p>“Steve is a valued part of our legacy, and we will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish,” he said.</p> All 18 Movies and Shows Steve Bannon Wrote, Directed or Produced (Photos) <p>1 of 25</p> <p>Bannon produced Hollywood movies in the 1990s, but most of his efforts have gone to making polemic, conservative documentaries</p> <p>Before he had the ear of the president, former White House Chief Political Strategist Steve Bannon tried his hand at Hollywood. As a producer, he was behind several small movies, but he really hit his movie-making stride writing and directing conservative documentaries aimed at Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

	<article id="0000954" published-at="2017-12-31" title="Seeking refuge by submission"><a type="internal"/> <p>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</p> <p>Dhimmi refers to the status of non-Muslims living in an Islamic state. The word literally means “protected person by submission.” But what are they protected from? The wrath of <a type="internal">Islam</a>! It can be likened to the mobsters who collect money from people for “protection.” Non-Muslims are allowed to live in Islamic states, but with many restrictions. If these non-Muslims behave themselves and practice their own religion under the guidelines of sharia, they will not be persecuted or killed. Otherwise, the local imams and the religious leaders incite Muslims to harm the dhimmis.</p> <p>We have our own pro facto dhimmis in the United States. They are people who believe that if they support and promote everything Islamic, they will escape being labeled Islamophobes or attacked by Muslims. They are paying dearly for this benefit.</p> <p>President Trump, by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, told the world that he would not be a dhimmi. One would think when he decided to move the U.S. embassy that he had given the city to Israel, but Jerusalem has been Israeli land since the war of June 1967 and a decisive and miraculous victory. That victory led to the reunification of the Jewish people with their holy city after 2,000 years of exile.</p> <p>Mr. Trump, in moving the embassy to Israel’s proclaimed capital and honoring the U.S. Senate vote of 1995, refused to submit as a dhimmi to the intimidation and fact twisting of the Muslim nations, who are themselves backed by the dhimmis of the United Nations. He did what nine American presidents before him were afraid to do.</p> <p>The Muslim nations, after their humiliating defeat in the war of 1967, refused to acknowledge the loss, and the U.N. helped them to solidify their pathological denial by issuing the infamous United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. Since then, they have continued to push that lie down the throats of the international community. Those who object to the lie and acknowledge the truth are threatened by the wrath of all ages: either be a dhimmi and support the lie, including the other famous lie that <a type="internal">Islam</a> is the religion of peace, or you will be slaughtered.</p> <p>If moving the American embassy to Jerusalem triggers a global Muslim outrage, regardless of race, country of origin or sect affiliation, that proves without any doubt that <a type="internal">Islam</a> is a political movement that is adamant and relentless to push its ideology on all other religions and all other nations. They seek domination above all else; historical facts be damned.</p> <p>The mainstream media, giving a platform to people like Hillary Clinton, blame Mr. Trump’s lack of submission to <a type="internal">Islam</a> for a predicted rise in jihad around the globe. They claim, and try to convince us, that his lack of being dhimmi causes harm to our soldiers and to our country, and that his comments cause an increase in ISIS recruits. How many times have we heard this lie from the media and Hillary Clinton?</p> <p>Dhimmis are submitting to <a type="internal">Islam</a> for one reason: their own personal safety. In the long term, their submission means they are giving up their country and their freedom. It begins with closing their eyes to Muslim kids who come to school with black and blue marks after being beaten by their parents and not reporting it. It goes on to police departments who call honor killings “domestic abuse,” or excusing rapes and molestation as “cultural norms;” to not hosting Christmas events or wearing a cross necklace because it might offend a Muslim.</p> <p>Yes, there is a growing population in the U.S. who have already become dhimmis, and if their choices only affected themselves, that would be their choice. The problem, however, is that most of these people are in places of power, either economically, politically, or religiously, and they are dragging a host of others into the dhimmi spiral with them.</p> <p>My heart sinks when I think America could go the way of all those countries in the Middle East that used to be Christian, like my home country of Egypt. I see what is happening in Europe and I see <a type="internal">Islam</a> knocking at our door as well. If you study history as I have, you know their methodology and their goals; they have never changed. We have a choice: we can either stick our heads in the sand or we can take a stand. I choose to take a stand and pray for God’s wisdom and grace to do His will in all things.</p> <p>• Mark Christian, a physician, is an ex-Sunni Muslim, counter-terrorism expert and a frequent speaker and lecturer on all aspects of political <a type="internal">Islam</a>.</p> <p>The Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im, our third-party provider.

	<article id="0000955" published-at="2018-01-06" title="A small-R republican gripe: Can we stop capitalizing ‘president’?!"><a type="internal"/> National Park Service workers clear snow on the North Lawn of the White House, Thursday, Jan. 4, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) <p>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</p> <p>Somewhere along the way of writing up information about the president — that’s president with a small “p” in this context, not capital “P” — grammar-tarians lost their grammatical compass. Or maybe it was political hacks, either unschooled, unconcerned or undisciplined about the finer points of proper punctuation, or worse, purposely trying to turn the president into a All Hail the President with a capital “P,” no matter the context.</p> <p>Who knows.</p> <p>Either way, what’s happened is they started writing President when it should be president. It’s been going on for some time, pre- <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a>, pre-Barack Obama, even. But it’s becoming more common-place. And it’s time to nip it in the bud.</p> <p>This is not simply a Grammar Police matter.</p> <p>This is a particular gripe because it places the president in a spot of honor he just doesn’t deserve — really, in a place of respect that better belongs with the People, or the Citizens, or maybe even the Taxpayers.</p> <p>Better to capitalize those words than “president.”</p> <p>You see, when president is President, even when grammar says he should be president, the message to the reader is this: The President is a Very Important Person — so important that even his title must always be capitalized.</p> <p>But lookie here. We don’t even do that with God.</p> <p>Why so with president-slash-President?</p> <p>In a January 3 email from the White House Office of Communications, a statement from President <a type="internal">Trump</a> read this way: “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency.”</p> <p>Wrong. It’s presidency, small “p.”</p> <p>In a December email from the same office, it was more of the same, with a message that opened, “The President,” that should have read “The president.”</p> <p>This isn’t just coming from the ideological right.</p> <p>In a January 4 email from the left-leaning pro-immigrant nonprofit, America’s Voice, a statement read: “For some Republicans … the strategy is pretty clear: pretend you want a deal (because the President has said he wants one … “</p> <p>Again, it’s “the president,” people.</p> <p>It’s not just emailed notifications. It’s official WhiteHouse.gov communications, notifications and posts.</p> <p>“Which President served as a lieutenant colonel in the Spanish-American war?” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/" type="external">asks</a> the WhiteHouse.gov post on “Presidents.”</p> <p>And this, the most recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-sarah-sanders01042018/" type="external">posting</a> from the White House’s James S. Brady Press Briefing Room site, a transcript of Sarah Huckabee Sanders during her January 4 press conference: “The President’s economic agenda … “</p> <p>The official White House Twitter feed is <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse" type="external">filled</a> with even more of the maddening capitalization errors.</p> <p>From January 5: “and, the President’s emphasis …”</p> <p>From January 3: “In speeches over the past year, the President has called …”</p> <p>From January 2, a retweet from Pence’s own account: “This President has delivered.”</p> <p>From December 28, against from @WhiteHouse’s account: “The President’s FY 2018 Budget requests another $500M.”</p> <p>No. No, no, no, no, no and no once more. These are not simple faux pas, the work of grammar-challenged entities. They’re elevations of importance that should not be.</p> <p>It’s President <a type="internal">Trump</a>, but <a type="internal">Trump</a>, the president — just like it’s God is God, but the president is not a god.</p> <p>And perhaps, that’s a good way to remember it.</p> <p>The president of the United States, no matter how honorable, no matter how great, no matter how awesome of all awesomeness in policy, politics and partisan bent, is still, here in America, a servant. A servant of the people.</p> <p>A servant of the American people.</p> <p>His title is not one of reverence. His name isn’t spoken in hushed whispers. Moreover, America is not a nation that regards titles with awe or reverence. We’re all equal here — no caste system in sight.</p> <p>So let’s remember: The White House chief is just a dude. He’s not God, or even a god. Let’s put the “p’s” into proper grammatical context. If anyone deserves a consistently capitalized letter — outside of God, that is — it’s the citizens who elect, the taxpayers who employ, the patriots who defend.</p> <p>Cheryl Chumley may be contacted at cchumley@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter, @ckchumley.</p> <p>The Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im, our third-party provider.

	<article id="0000956" published-at="2018-01-07" title="Trump’s opportunity to shine"><a type="internal"/> Illustration on aiding freedom in Iran through discontinuing the JCPOA deal by Alexander Hunter/The Washington Times more &amp;gt; <p>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</p> <p>The Iranian election of 2009, re-electing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was so obviously fixed that the results ignited a near-revolt that threatened the terror-sponsoring regime of the ayatollahs.</p> <p>The <a type="internal">Green Movement</a>, led by prominent Iranians including former premier Hossein Mousavi, seriously threatened the regime that has been an implacable enemy of the United States since it came to power in 1979. The rebellion’s failure was assured by President Obama.</p> <p>Instead of helping the protesters, Mr. Obama criticized them, saying that they didn’t represent “fundamental change.” He spoke meekly, saying that, “The world is watching and inspired by their participation, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election was.”</p> <p>Mr. Obama did far worse. We know, from Wall Street Journal reporter Jay Solomon’s book, “The Iran Wars,” that the <a type="internal">CIA</a> approached Mr. Obama seeking permission to engage in a secret campaign to help the Greens overthrow the ayatollahs. Mr. Obama ordered the <a type="internal">CIA</a> to sever contacts with that movement and not take action against the Iranian regime. The <a type="internal">Green Movement</a> was suppressed.</p> <p>In his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama spoke often of his willingness to negotiate with Iran. His administration first made contact with Iran in 2011. As those negotiations proceeded for the next four years, Mr. Obama feared negative publicity about Iran that could have interfered. To minimize it, he stopped a long-standing DEA investigation called “Operation Cassandra” investigating drug trafficking and money laundering by Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed terrorist network that governs Lebanon.</p> <p>In September 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry signed the Iran nuclear weapons deal. It was, as President <a type="internal">Trump</a> has said repeatedly, the worst possible deal. Not only did it enable Iran to continue its nuclear weapons development in secret, it reduced or eliminated the international sanctions that forced it to the bargaining table.</p> <p>Iran, like every other despotism, is neither monolithic nor stable. On Dec. 28, 2017, massive protests broke out across Iran threatening the ayatollah’s regime. This time the protesters are demonstrating against unemployment, a weak economy, the corruption of the regime and its military adventurism in Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere.</p> <p>Some protesters have chanted “death to Khamenei,” the ruling ayatollah, and have attacked Basij militiamen sent out to quash the protests, both unheard of even in the 2009 nascent rebellion.</p> <p>These events give <a type="internal">Mr. Trump</a> the opportunity to remedy his predecessor’s mistakes. He can, and should, seize that opportunity quickly.</p> <p>President <a type="internal">Trump</a> has already done better than his predecessor. On Jan. 1 he tweeted, “Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food &amp;amp; for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!”</p> <p>Iran’s enmity toward us is no less than it was in 2009. Its sponsorship of Islamic terrorism across the globe has, if anything, increased. The president can, and should, do a lot more than engage in a Twitter exchange with current Iranian President Rouhani.</p> <p>There will be escalating violence against the Iranian protesters. The regime’s police and Basij militia have already killed dozens. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the regime’s military arm, is likely to soon move against the protesters. Many more will die, probably resulting in the complete suppression of the current protests.</p> <p>But as these protests and the <a type="internal">Green Movement</a> of 2009 proved, the ayatollahs’ regime is vulnerable. Regardless of what happens to the Iranian protesters in the next weeks, <a type="internal">Mr. Trump</a> needs to act decisively.</p> <p>What Mr. Obama forbade in 2009 <a type="internal">Mr. Trump</a> should authorize in 2018. The <a type="internal">CIA</a> will have plans to fund and help the opposition organize fomenting revolution in Iran to oust the ayatollahs and return Iran to a semblance of freedom. That covert action can be authorized by a secret “presidential determination,” which <a type="internal">Mr. Trump</a> should sign as soon as possible.</p> <p>Later this month, <a type="internal">Mr. Trump</a> will again face the problem of certifying Iran’s compliance with Mr. Obama’s nuclear deal. Last October he refused to do that. Now he can do more.</p> <p><a type="internal">Mr. Trump</a> again said, correctly, that the deal as one of the worst and one-sided deals America has ever made. This month, he will be strongly advised against revoking the deal by a host of senators, diplomats from Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, as well, in all likelihood, by his national security adviser.</p> <p>Those opposing revocation of the deal will argue that the “international community” stands behind it, pointing to the U.N. Security Council’s action approving the deal. Mr. Obama substituted that action for ratification by the senate, which would have made it a treaty. The Security Council’s action neither binds <a type="internal">Mr. Trump</a> nor has any legal effect under U.S. law.</p> <p>Mr. Obama’s deal was not only the worst deal he could have made. It was — like his refusal to authorize the <a type="internal">CIA</a> to topple the regime and his order stopping the DEA’s Operation Cassandra — an action directly in contravention of our most important national security interests.</p> <p>By revoking Mr. Obama’s deal, <a type="internal">Mr. Trump</a> can both take strong action in our national security interests and pressure our allies to open their eyes to one of the gravest dangers we all face. It’s time for him to do so.</p> <p>• Jed Babbin, a deputy undersecretary of defense in the George H.W.

My, how lib regressives change their narrative…..lost souls that can never be healed! In other words mentally unstable. <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/10/chelsea-clinton-tries-to-bash-republicans-in-tweet-but-actually-destroys-michelle-obama-instead/" type="external">GEEZ!</a></p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Did you hear? Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of YOUR former President Bill Clinton and his crazy wife Hillary Clinton has just inadvertently ripped former lady Michelle Obama a new one, and it’s all over Twitter. Chelsea hit her Twitter this week to give her two cents on a recent study that showed that kids learn better and are far more attentive and retain their learning when they are not hungry and eat foods that are of nutritional value to their brains and growth.</p> <p>“Research again confirms kids pay more attention in class &amp;amp; better retain what they’re taught when they’re not hungry,” Clinton wrote.</p> <q> <p>When one Twitter user replied and said the study’s results were obvious, Clinton used the opportunity to bash Republicans, writing that Republicans have been trying to repeal free lunches and block nutritional food requirements.</p> </q> <p>“Sadly, many Republicans continue to argue against free school lunches &amp;amp; breakfasts &amp;amp; against nutritional support for families,” Clinton wrote.</p> <p>Now of course, her goal was to hit at Republicans, but what Chelsea ACTUALLY did was throw shade at former First Lady, Michelle Obama. While Obama was in office, Michelle Obama took it upon herself to overhaul school lunches on a national level and expanded the free and reduced lunch program. The problem was the changes that they implemented were not received well at all and the proof is on social media where students have posted pictures of the unappetizing and small lunches they had started receiving under Obama’s plan. With captions that were anything but complimentary.</p> <p>So, you can imagine the response Chelsea got right?</p> <p>Chelsea has been getting more than the usual amount of news coverage lately even if it is negative and in reaction to some of her amazingly dumb statements. Here she is making statements about things I doubt she can be called an expert on. I wonder if she’s being programmed by people who can’t wait to slap ”Chelsea 2024” on their bumpers. If this is the case, then her advisers aren’t any brighter than the masterminds of ”Hillary 2016.”</p> <p>Chelsea Clinton should just go away while she’s behind. Same for her mommy.</p></article>

	<article id="0000960" published-at="2017-12-27" title="Boom: CBS News Report, Bernie Sanders Comments Confirm Sweeping Benefits of GOP Tax Law"><p>We've been <a type="internal">having some fun</a> at the expense of Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party's literally <a type="internal">apocalyptic hyperbole</a> and rhetorical overreach about the new tax reform law, <a type="internal">showcasing examples</a> of businesses -- large and small -- that are celebrating passage of the landmark legislation by paying out employee bonuses, raising wages, expanding, and making charitable investments. For what it's worth, here are a <a href="https://twitter.com/guypbenson/status/944667972966248449" type="external">few</a> additional <a href="https://twitter.com/guypbenson/status/944669206284591106" type="external">examples</a> that have <a href="https://twitter.com/business/status/944333015597056000" type="external">cropped up</a> since our last pre-Christmas post <a href="https://twitter.com/StewSays/status/945784360103497728" type="external">on the matter</a>. As we await more announcements from corporations and small businesses across the country in the new year, I'd like to go back and underscore two significant developments that Matt covered over the holidays -- they're <a type="internal">both</a> really <a type="internal">important</a>.</p> <p>First, in a video I flagged as " <a href="https://twitter.com/guypbenson/status/944287211889012737" type="external">must watch</a>" on Twitter, CBS News delved into the personal finances of three families across the country to determine how the new tax law will impact them. Each household cut distinct profiles; a low-income single mother in North Carolina, a pair of middle-income married educators in Rhode Island, and married small business owners with three kids in California. One thing that all three families had in common: Anxiety about the GOP plan. None of them were optimistic about how the new system will affect their pocketbooks, with two families explicitly anticipating a tax hike. This reflects widespread public opposition to the bill, driven by <a type="internal">aggressive misinformation</a> from the Left. When an accountant ran the actual numbers, however, all three households discovered that their tax burden was going down. Watch the entire thing:</p> <q> <p>Breaking news: <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSThisMorning?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">@CBSThisMorning</a> asked three families for their tax returns and found that all three would receive tax cuts next year because of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TaxCutsAndJobsAct?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">#TaxCutsAndJobsAct</a>. <a href="https://t.co/xnGvTgV3bJ" type="external">pic.twitter.com/xnGvTgV3bJ</a></p>— Senate Republicans (@SenateGOP) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenateGOP/status/944278505805811713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">December 22, 2017</a> </q> <p>This really should not be a surprising outcome in the least, given that <a type="internal">80 percent of filers</a> will see tax reductions under the bill -- yet this number cruncher's mathematical verdicts came as happy relief to these taxpayers, who'd succumbed to <a type="internal">relentless</a> <a type="internal">propaganda</a> and <a type="internal">media malpractice</a>. But reality did not comport with Democratic talking points. National Review's David French <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/454930/what-revealing-video-shows-us-about-tax-reform-debate" type="external">analyzes</a> the importance of the CBS news segment:</p> <q> <p>Please watch this. The surprise and relief on these taxpayers’ faces is palpable. I wonder why they’re so surprised that their taxes are going down? <a href="https://t.co/23GR6auqWj" type="external">https://t.co/23GR6auqWj</a></p>— David French (@DavidAFrench) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidAFrench/status/944289909820583937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">December 22, 2017</a> </q> <q> <p>This is exactly the dynamic Republicans are hoping for in 2018. Democrats and many members of the media relentlessly claimed the bill would hurt the middle class. They called it a “giveaway” to corporate America and to the very rich. Polls indicated that large numbers of Americans actually thought their taxes would increase. In other words, the public debate served mainly to obscure the truth and conceal the benefits to working families. So what happens when reality intervenes and Americans by the millions see their take-home pay increase? The GOP’s hope is that it will lead to a public reconsideration and a rebound in Republican fortunes at the polls. And that’s certainly possible. There has been an enormous amount of doom-mongering in the media and online, and if Republicans can keep America safe and prosperous in the coming year, and if family fortunes continue to improve, then some of the hysteria may lose its bite.

Meanwhile, Vermont Socialist Bernie Sanders -- who falsely described the Republican tax bill as a "massive attack" on the middle class -- was <a type="internal">forced to admit</a> that actually, 91 percent of middle class earners will receive a tax cut under this "massive attack," calling it a "very good thing." What a rhetorical shift:</p> <q> <p>. <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketapper?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">@jaketapper</a>: “Next year, 91% of middle income Americans will receive a tax cut. Isn’t that a good thing?” <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">@BernieSanders</a>: “Yeah, it is a very good thing. And that’s why we should’ve made the tax cuts for the middle class permanent” <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CNNSOTU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">#CNNSOTU</a> <a href="https://t.co/ei8xTHGo1E" type="external">https://t.co/ei8xTHGo1E</a></p>— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/944932787265695751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">December 24, 2017</a> </q> <p>Ninety-one percent. Bernie's complaint about the law is that the individual rate cuts were not made permanent. Republicans built in a "sunset" date for the tax cuts (a point <a type="internal">we've addressed</a> multiple times) so that they would hit certain revenue and budgetary targets in order to comply with reconciliation rules. Permanent tax cuts would have shown up as more lost revenue, thus growing deficits larger than their budget rules would allow. Senate Democrats, well aware of this dynamic, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2017/12/01/democrat-tax-bill-amendment-fails-senate/108195414/" type="external">offered an amendment</a> to make the cuts permanent, which would have blown up the bill (yes, Republicans could have radically altered the bill, trading away other measures they believe will spur economic growth to make the individual rate cuts permanent). Republicans voted it down. But remember: The only reason that the GOP was forced to play these numbers games was because they needed to pass the bill with a simple majority. Why? Zero Democrats <a type="internal">in either chamber</a> were willing to go along with their plan. Now that the bill has been passed and signed into law, and considering that Democrats got a lot of mileage out of the "corporate cuts are permanent, but individual cuts expire" attack, Rich Lowry <a href="https://twitter.com/RichLowry/status/944981035619618816" type="external">has a good idea</a>:</p> <q> <p>First thing Republicans should do when they are back is make Democrats vote on extending all the middle-class tax cuts <a href="https://t.co/YVSd9q8XLy" type="external">https://t.co/YVSd9q8XLy</a></p>— Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichLowry/status/944981035619618816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">December 24, 2017</a> </q> <p>We've been arguing all along that the "expiration date" exploited by liberals to advance deeply misleading and cherry-picked claims about the legislation was always a fiction. Recent experience and strong political incentives <a type="internal">each dictate</a> that middle class tax cuts will not be allowed to disappear eight years down the line. Sanders just confirmed that on CNN. If one of the most liberal members of the Senate wants those cuts to be permanent, Republicans should oblige him with a vote. Tailor a new bill very narrowly to permanently extend the new law's tax cuts that benefit working class and middle income Americans. Bring it up as a stand-alone bill, " <a type="internal">fill the tree</a>" on Senate amendments, then let the Democrats vote on it. If they vote yes, they'll explode one of their only reasonably-defensible arguments against the bill (their alleged concerns about deficits -- <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/454818/tax-cuts-were-spoonful-sugar-now-spending-cuts-are-medicine" type="external">a serious issue</a>, I might add -- are laughable) while essentially conceding how helpful the law really is to middle income Americans (contra their entire mendacious messaging strategy). If they vote no, they'll be opposing their own idea, confirming that they cynically offered it just a few weeks ago solely as a means to derail the legislative process; they'd also highlight how the Democratic Party is the only party standing in the way of avoiding the future middle class tax hike about which Congressional Democrats say they're so terribly worried. Jam 'em, Paul and Mitch.</p> <p>I'll leave you with a few additional examples of the misperceptions and lies that have taken root, which bear no resemblance to reality. First, I had a liberal relative in California inform me over the holidays that the majority of Californians will see tax increases because of the Republican law. In fact, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/12/18/california-voters-down-on-gop-tax-bill-poll-finds/" type="external">87 percent of Californians</a> will receive a tax cut in 2019, with a vast majority (67 percent) still in the "winner" column even in 2027 -- after the unlikely "expiration" of cuts. The story I linked cites a poll showing a majority of California voters opposing a law that will directly benefit nearly nine in ten taxpayers. And then there's this <a href="https://twitter.com/Brian_Riedl/status/944682091631009793" type="external">bonkers column</a>, which attempts to recast a sweeping tax cut -- benefiting 80 percent of households, and reducing taxes on average across every income group -- as "by far" the "largest tax increase" in American history. This is upside-down, pants-on-fire, utterly false, propaganda:</p> <q> <p>Criticisms of the tax bill are growing increasingly unhinged and bizarre.Apparently the bill's legitimate criticisms (of which there are several) are not sufficiently apocalyptic. <a href="https://t.co/8dNxZZCXcC" type="external">https://t.co/8dNxZZCXcC</a></p>— Brian Riedl (@Brian_Riedl) <a href="https://twitter.com/Brian_Riedl/status/944682091631009793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">December 23, 2017</a> </q> <p>The column's author and his editors should be embarrassed to have run these lies.

	<article id="0000961" published-at="2017-10-18" title="Criminal Minds - Blue Angel - Review: “Retribution”"><p><a type="internal">AN</a> <a type="internal">Criminal Minds</a> <a type="internal">Reviews</a></p> <p>Don’t let the title of this review fool you. Despite its ominous tone, it’s only in reference to this episode’s case. Yes, just like with our last episode, this is another typical case of the week outing, with all the drama being confined only to the case itself. Unlike the previous case, however, this one wasn’t quite so clear-cut and predictable. That’s a good thing, too, as it kept me, and likely many other viewers guessing for much of the episode, and gave us some intriguing and genuinely unsettling moments along the way.</p> <p>This episode also gave us a glimpse into new team member Matt Simmons’ home life. Since those who watched “Beyond Borders” got to know him pretty well on there, they kept the “personal life” bits fairly brief, but even then, it was a nice bit of light, fluffy distraction, which, given all we’ve seen these characters go through thus far, was a welcome change of pace.</p> <p>The moments with Matt were also a nice balance to the dark and creepy nature of the case itself. Thankfully, the show spared us seeing any grotesque images this week, but our imaginations weren’t quite as lucky, if the descriptions we heard throughout are anything to go by. Brace yourselves as we prepare to wade through this messed up nightmare.</p> <p>The Case:</p> <p>Things start off on a mysterious note, as we see a car driving into a dark, wooded area. A person decked out in black, their face completely shrouded, grabs some sharp instruments, so it’s pretty clear at this point that something nefarious is afoot.</p> <p>Sure enough, that winds up being true, as the mystery person enters some sort of building, where there’s even more sharp instruments, along with a wheelchair. They seem to be examining if the place is ready, and evidently it is, as they return to their car shortly afterward, only to reveal somebody is being held captive in the trunk. A poor guy’s already crappy night is about to get even worse.</p> <p>That poor guy’s name, as we soon learn is Curtis, and Emily informs us, and the team, of the nightmare he suffered. Garcia tries to be as delicate as possible as she helps fill in the details, but even then, the facts are still pretty graphic. Curtis was hung in the warehouse, after having suffered all sorts of severe injuries – cuts and bruises and the like.</p> <p>Oh, yeah, and the unsub completely chopped off his entire manhood as well. So that’s disturbing. Reid’s reaction to this unpleasant bit of news was pretty similar to mine.</p> <p>As is par for the course with this show, this is clearly not the unsub’s first kill, either. A man named Darrel had been found dead recently as well, and sure enough, he was murdered the same way Curtis was. Tara and Matt throw out a few potential theories regarding the graphic nature of these murders; she suggests potential drug cartels, while he wonders if this is the work of the Chaldean Mafia, a brutal and notorious organization based out of Detroit. Matt had become familiar with their crimes when he worked in that state years prior. As the team prepare to head out to Detroit, we see another man being held captive and pleading for his life, so yep, there’ll soon be a new body waiting for the team when they arrive.</p> <p>Judging from what little info the team can gleam about Curtis and Darrel, they don’t seem like obvious targets. Curtis was an attorney, and that job comes with its own risks, but this sort of murder seems a bit over the top in terms of potential retaliation. And Darrel was about as mild-mannered as they come. However, both men did recently withdraw nearly ten thousand dollars, which, naturally, gets the red flags up. People generally don’t pull that large an amount of money just for the heck of it. Later, when Matt and Emily interview Curtis’ wife, they get a better idea of just why Curtis could’ve been using that money. According to her, Curtis handled the family finances, and her reaction to the transactions indicates she suspected her husband was sneaking around on her. Combine that suspicion with him blowing tons of money on a woman, and the team’s been down this road enough times to know what’s likely going on. Curtis, and Darrel, were paying for escorts.</p> <p>“They were honest relationships. More honest than marriage, I’d say.”</p> <p>With Garcia’s help, the team learns about a site called Blue Siren, which initially looks like your average dating site, but is quickly revealed to be an escort service website. And the woman Curtis and Darrel met up with was named Dasha. Clearly a professional name. After finding out where the Blue Siren headquarters are (apparently it’s in a college sorority house, which is interesting), JJ and Luke head out there to interview a woman who works for that site. She’s not there when they arrive, but another woman who worked with her tells them that her real name is actually Kimberly. She’s no longer part of the Blue Siren group, but the woman confirms that Curtis and Darrel did visit the Blue Siren site, and were likely involved with Kimberly at some point. Kimberly insists that her relationships with the men she saw were purely innocent and safe, though.</p> <p>Emily and Matt later track down Kimberly herself, and they inform her about the murders. She’s understandably horrified, and starts to fear that she might be a target as well. As a result, Emily sets up a protective detail for her, and Matt does his part by staying and keeping her company for the night. She discusses how easy it is for married men to be lured in by women like her, because of the forbidden nature of the encounter, and even attempts a slight flirtation of her own. Matt ain’t biting, though. He's got a job to do, dagnabit.</p> <p>Elsewhere, JJ and Luke talk to Kimberly’s mom, Janel. She’s not happy about the life her daughter’s been living, and expresses concern about her well-being. She also reveals that Kimberly’s dad died when she was young, and she doesn’t have any siblings, or other extended family. Seems it’s pretty much just been Kimberly and her mom against the world all this time. And as Garcia soon discovers, the men in Kimberly’s family all tended to die young. Odd.</p> <p>“Sick bastard made a snuff film.”</p> <p>While all this is going on, Reid is busy examining some videotapes that had been sent to the local police. These tapes contain footage of the poor men being mercilessly tortured, and they’re pretty gruesome, if the reactions of everyone watching are anything to go by. The local officers are puzzled about the means by which the tapes were sent - they were recorded on cassette, of all things. What this means about their unsub, they’re still not entirely sure, but in the meantime, Reid does manage to get a few audio and visual clues as to where this warehouse is.</p> <p>As the team arrives to investigate the warehouse, things get even creepier and more surprising. The unsub, upon seeing the team show up, decides to destroy and set fire to the entire place, causing just enough of a distraction for them to escape. In the aftermath of the fire, the team finds a symbol related to the Chaldean Mafia, indicating Matt’s initial assumption is right, and they also discover a woman’s skull in the backyard as well. It’s soon revealed that the skull belongs to a woman named Cynthia, and that she’s apparently been dead for quite some time. This discovery comes on the heels of the recent murder of a third man named Philip. What initially looked like a relatively simple string of murders targeting men who visited escorts is becoming an increasingly complex mystery with each passing moment, as the victim type continues to change and shift.</p> <p>That becomes even more apparent when the unsub soon targets Janel and Kimberly themselves, managing to overpower and get past the protective detail before kidnapping them. It’s at this point we finally see who our unsub is, and it turns out it’s a man – and one Janel and Kimberly are apparently familiar with, if the man’s chilling “Welcome home” greeting to them is any indication.</p> <p>Both women attempt to placate this guy, but he doesn’t seem all that interested in listening to them. At least, not at first. Soon, though, he starts to get emotional, apologizing to Janel for abandoning her. Janel doesn’t seem to like where this conversation’s going and tries to stop it, but the cat slips out of the bag anyway. Kimberly soon learns the same thing the team recently discovered: Janel isn’t her mom. She’s her aunt. And the unsub, whose name is Gabriel, is Kimberly’s father. Quite a couple big bombshells to drop at a time like this, no? Gabriel soon reveals that his main reason for his killing spree is a chance to “fix everything”. Once he’s gotten rid of the men who took advantage of his sweet, innocent daughter, he can try and work on starting a new life with Kimberly. Second chances are all well and good, but in this particular case, yeah, thinking that’s gonna be a hard sell for her, buddy.</p> <p>Janel soon confirms Gabriel’s story, and when she goes to talk to him, Kimberly attempts to escape. A scuffle occurs, during which Janel stabs Gabriel in the back, and while he’s distracted with the knife, Kimberly flees. Thankfully, before Gabriel can off Janel for good and chase after his daughter, the team arrives, pulling Kimberly and Janel to safety. Gabriel attempts his own escape, but after a brief but intense wrestling match between him and Matt, Matt gains the upper hand and takes him in.</p> <p>This of course begs the question: if Janel was really Kimberly’s aunt, then what happened to her mother? Well, remember poor Cynthia and her skull? Yep. There’s your answer. After their daughter was born back in 1996, Cynthia obviously didn’t want Gabriel's mafia lifestyle to impact their child, so she’d planned on leaving him. What’s more, she also threatened to alert the authorities to his crimes. Gabriel couldn’t have that, so he killed Cynthia and then turned Kimberly over to his sister, Janel, allowing her to raise the girl. Janel was so disturbed by her brother’s criminal history that she decided to keep all of this a secret from Kimberly for years in an attempt to protect her.</p> <p>Unfortunately, for all Gabriel’s attempts to stay out of prison, he did wind up serving some time for his crimes. After being released, he attempted to turn over a new leaf and tried to reconnect with Kimberly. Once he found out what she was doing for a living, however, he couldn’t help sliding back into his old criminal ways in his own twisted attempt to protect her, and as a result, a lot of men wound up paying the ultimate price.</p> <p>“You’re not like him.”</p> <p>Kimberly is understandably shaken by the events of the case and all the new information she’s learned, to the point where she expresses regret to Matt that he didn’t kill her father. So much for any hope of a family reunion, then. She does, however, point out that Matt reminded her that good men do exist out there, and is bolstered by his kind and supportive words about herself and her aunt.</p> <p>Kudos to the show for giving us an unpredictable case this go-round. When I first saw the promos and sneak peeks for it, and even while observing Kimberly and Janel’s behavior throughout early on, I’d initially assumed our unsub would be one of those women. Maybe somebody in this organization had had enough of some shady stuff that had been going down, be it within the organization itself or with the men the women met up with, and wanted to fight back. Maybe Janel was a bitter woman whose husband had left her for, or had an affair with, a prostitute, and she wanted to destroy that system from within. Then when Garcia mentioned the fact that the men in Kimberly’s family died young, I started wondering if this wasn’t some sort of family affair. Perhaps Janel and Kimberly were a criminal duo.</p> <p>Honestly, I still kind of wish the episode had gone with that kind of premise, because I think it could’ve been a rather interesting route to go, and because I feel like the story about the men in Kimberly’s family dying young was a tantalizing tidbit that was ultimately left danging when it should’ve been explored further. That said, I do appreciate that Gabriel’s motive wasn’t as clear-cut as one would initially think. The mafia aspect, while perhaps adding a little too much clutter to an already complex case, certainly provided a powerful motive for some of his murders, as well as a plausible explanation for how he became such an effective killing machine.</p> <p>I particularly liked the push and pull between Gabriel wanting to redeem himself and start anew with his daughter and his sister and being lured back into his old criminal ways. I wish the show had explored that struggle a little more, instead of waiting until late in the episode to bring it up, especially given how he didn’t seem to show much remorse when he was holding Janel and Kimberly captive. At the same time, though, it was clear that Gabriel was a very broken and confused man, and I do think those aspects of his personality and mindset did come through well enough during his family confrontation, to where you could see his struggle to some degree.</p> <p>Kimberly and Janel made for intriguing characters, too. Even when Kimberly did try and come on all alluring while talking with Matt, it came off more as her just falling back on her usual means of communicating with men. I thought that was a good, subtle way to show just how much this job has affected her. And considering her comfort in knowing that Matt was a good, trustworthy man, it was clear some of her behavior towards him had been a test, too. I like that she got to see an example of a decent man in action.</p> <p>And I felt for poor Janel, with the thought of just how many secrets she was carrying on her shoulders for so long. I like that her protectiveness wasn’t so overt, that for the most part, it came out in very realistic, quiet ways. That helped make the moment when she tried to stab Gabriel all the more shocking and powerful. Janel definitely came off as one of those “beware the quiet ones” sorts. I liked seeing both women doing what they could to fight back, and that they were both savvy and had strong self-preservation instincts, both in regards to the case and their lives in general.</p> <p>My biggest gripes were these four aspects:</p> <p>1) Could’ve done without Gabriel’s whole “this is why I’m doing what I do” speech towards the end. I get that that was supposed to be part of what unsubs like him do, but it just came off way too much like one of those “bad guy stops to give a speech to the good guy about their plans” moments you see in movies. I think the reveal might’ve come off more intimidating and unsettling if he’d forced Janel to be the one to confess everything to Kimberly, and hadn’t said a word himself.</p> <p>2) Much as I liked seeing Matt’s physical abilities when taking Gabriel down in that alleyway, ummm...where, exactly, was his backup? Given all the team’s been through lately, you’d think that nobody would be going anywhere without at least one person tagging along. Matt should’ve had somebody behind him the whole time.</p> <p>3) Gabriel pulling the knife out of his back felt a little “super strength”-y, no? Maybe if he hadn’t spent so much time yammering on about why he was killing people to Janel and Kimberly, he could’ve avoided being stabbed in the first place.</p> <p>4) Why, exactly, was the episode called “Blue Angel”? Nothing in the episode gave a nod to it, except for the Blue Siren website, but even then, there was no indication that it had any angelic undertones. I’m presuming the “angel” part could’ve been referring to Kimberly, given her family’s concerns about somebody as innocent as her getting caught up in this sleazy business, but even then, it feels a bit of a stretch, so...yeah. Go figure.</p> <p>Those issues aside, though, I think this case generally worked pretty well overall. Everyone played a role of some sort in it, the variety of potential suspects added to the mystery and suspense, and we got to sympathize with the victims along the way. Even the men who visited the website weren’t necessarily evil bad guys (with the exception, perhaps, of Curtis, ‘cause of the whole “cheating on his wife” thing, but yeah). This is how I want to see the cases of the week going forward – not so over the top that they become ridiculous, but with just enough zigzags throughout to keep us guessing and wondering how it will all play out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back at Quantico:</p> <p>Not a whole lot to report on here, honestly. Reid talked to Garcia and Luke about possible ideas of things to discuss in his upcoming seminars, and we got brief peeks at Matt’s home life. “Beyond Borders” viewers know that Matt's married and has a gaggle full of kids, and sure enough, we got to see the whole brood this episode. The kids don’t show up until the end, when they all crowd into bed with their parents, but it was a cute scene nonetheless.</p> <p>And I liked what we saw of Matt’s wife, too. Her name is Kristy, and she seems pretty darn happy with her husband’s new job. When Matt was with the International Response Team, he was away a lot, but apparently, now that he’s at the BAU, he has better hours and more time at home with his family. Which is interesting, considering how often this team seems to be away from home, and how common an issue this job was for other team members’ relationships and families over the years. I suppose, though, it’s easier to deal with the separation that comes from being in another part of the U.S. as opposed to being in another part of the world altogether.</p> <p>We also learned that nearly ten years into their marriage, Matt and Kristy are still as lovey-dovey as ever, to the point where he managed to tempt her back to bed for a little morning fun before work. I hope the show continues to let this marriage last. The guys on the team generally haven’t had much luck in the romance department, after all – either their wives or girlfriends died, or in the case of Stephen, he was the one to be killed off. Morgan was the only male team member to go off to a happy life with Savannah. So it’d be nice to have Matt and Kristy’s relationship play out as well as Morgan’s did. Buck the trend a little more.</p> <p>As for Reid, I enjoyed seeing him discussing his seminars. He was excited about them in a way that showed the old Reid spark was back (or at least, on its way back), and we also got to learn about an interesting fallacy known as “the Linda problem” in the process. Long story short, it’s a conjunction fallacy that deals with people’s assumptions that two separate events may be connected, when it’s just as probable, if not more so, that they happened completely independent of each other. It’s just the sort of problem that I could see Reid being interested in, and what made it all the more fun was that Garcia was as knowledgeable about it as he was, and that they got to chat about it a bit. Always fun to be reminded of just how much Reid and Garcia have in common.</p> <p>It was nice to see Luke showing interest in their discussion as well, even if he agrees with Garcia that it might be a bit over most agents’ heads. I personally think it’d be a perfect topic to cover, given that the conjunction fallacy is something that can and has come up in this line of work before. Whether Reid does wind up discussing “the Linda problem” in his seminars or not, I hope we get more glimpses at what he wants to teach, and eventually, what he does decide to teach. It’s just good to see Reid acting like himself again, and having something to look forward to to boot.</p> <p>So that’s that. Another week, another normal outing. How long this trend will continue to last, I don’t know, but for now, I’m fine with the peace and quiet.</p> <p>What did you think of the episode? Did the case play out as you’d predicted, or did it provide some surprises along the way? Did you enjoy the glimpse into Matt’s home life? Do you have any fun ideas regarding topics for Reid to cover in his seminars?

Our streets!” they shouted. Police dogs inside a K9 unit wagon barked loudly.</p> <p>Police sirens and flashers filled the summer night air after the protesters regrouped at City Hall, then headed in the direction of the police station to bail out an arrested demonstrator. At least two more protesters were arrested on the march to the station. Police sirens drowned out the anti-police chants as the marchers passed Mechanics Hall.</p> <p>The main rally was a family-friendly event. Parents and children with homemade signs staked out spots around the plaza. “Hate has no home here,” one sign read. “Teach love,” read another. One woman wore a “Resist Fascism” kerchief on her head.</p> <p>Loree Burns, 47, of West Boylston, held a handmade sign that read “On the Side of (Love),” with a large heart. She was attending with her daughter, Catherine, 15, and friend Marissa Gardner, 14.</p> <p>“I think what happened in Charlottesville was reprehensible,” Ms. Burns said. “The only thing that I could do right now is stand up in solidarity with the people of Charlottesville.”</p> <p>The girls’ signs read, “Warrior of Love,” and “Love Makes the World Go Round.”</p> <p>“When I saw on the news what happened in Charlottesville, I was really disgusted and upset at what people thought was OK and was right,” said Ms. Gardner. “I think it’s really important to organize and show the actions of a few do not really stand for all of us.”</p> <p>Said the younger Ms. Burns: “We just need to keep the love going.”</p> <p>Nearby, a couple in colorful tie-dyed shirts stood with their son and their collection of signs. Aimee Ledwell, 42, of Maynard, was penning “End Racism Now” on the back of a piece of poster board. Husband Joshua, 44, held their Black Lives Matter lawn sign. And son C.J., 8, had drawn a sign reading “Let Love and Kindness Grow,” with a picture of his cat.</p> <p>“We of course are always standing on the side of love,” Mrs. Ledwell said. “After the violence this weekend, we could not just stay at home and not come and stand up for what’s right. So here we are.”</p> <p>Mrs. Ledwell was asked what she hoped would be the takeaway from the anti-racism rally.</p> <p>“The more people who stand up the better,” she said. “The more we have big crowds gathering and saying, ‘No, this is not normal,’ ‘This is not OK,’ the more people will come and join them, too.</p> <p>“There is still a lot of fear. People have a hard time standing up. The more people do, you get momentum. And hopefully that momentum can make a difference every time.”</p> <p>Not 20 feet away from the family group, on the fringe of the crowd, stood several Antifa protesters, some wearing kerchiefs and black masks on their faces, holding signs that read “Resist Racism: Solidarity with Charlottesville.”</p> <p>“Don’t take my (expletive) picture,” one man with a kerchief around his face told an elderly woman who was taking a photo of the rally.</p> <p>The masked people, who were standing over an American flag on the ground, refused to be interviewed by the Telegram &amp;amp; Gazette.</p> <p>“I’m not going to answer any of your questions,” said a man with a black mask covering his face who was standing over the American flag.</p> <p>A woman with the group told the reporter: “This is harassment.” Asked what they planned to do with the flag, she said: “Please stop harassing them.”</p> <p>“What are you doing with a notepad?” asked another woman with the group. “If they don’t want to talk to you, you can probably just (expletive) off.” Asked why the others were covering their faces, she said: “You really should leave.”</p> <p>Asked if she felt non-violence was the way, she declined to speak.</p> <p>The Antifa protesters, numbering perhaps a couple dozen, were a small percentage of the crowd for the main rally, which drew hundreds.</p> <p>Matt Vahallas, 41, of Holden, held a sign picturing the Blues Brothers, with a quote from the movie: “I Hate (expletive) Nazis.” Mr. Vahallas said he was inspired to attend by the weekend’s swastika-waving demonstration in Charlottesville. “I thought World War II solved that problem,” he said.</p> <p>Toward the end of the rally, the crowd was encouraged to join in chants. “No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA,” they shouted. Then: “What do we want? Justice! If we don’t get it? Shut it down!”</p> <p>Soon thereafter, the Antifa people scaled the City Hall stairs, hung their banner from the balcony, and the mood turned.</p> <p>The main Rally Against Racism was organized by the Worcester chapter of the activist organization Showing Up for Social Justice in response to the events in Charlottesville.</p> <p>“Part of (our) cause is to call out racism and call white people into action when things like that happen,” said an organizer, Etel Haxhiaj, 37, of Worcester.</p> <p>Ms. Haxhiaj, interviewed in advance of the rally, was asked about Antifa. She declined to comment on the group.</p> <p>Seven members of the group Worcester Antifa - short for Worcester Anti-Fascist Action — were arrested in February during a protest in downtown Worcester in which they blocked traffic while chanting profane slogans against police, the Ku Klux Klan and fascism.</p> <p>The Antifa movement nationally and internationally describes its approach as “a confrontational response to fascist groups, rooted in militant left-wing and anarchist politics,” according to the magazine The Nation.</p></article>

Credit:Windover Way Photography <p>To attend the Indianapolis Colts game where the number of the legendary Peyton Manning was to be retired, Vice President Mike Pence, a former governor of Indiana, flew back from Las Vegas.</p> <p>With him in the stadium was his wife Karen. In honor of Manning, she wore a No. 18 jersey as “The Star Spangled Banner” began.</p> <p>The Pences stood, hands over hearts. A dozen San Francisco 49ers took a knee. When the national anthem ended, Pence walked out. His limousine took him back to the airport to fly to LA.</p> <p>“A stunt! That plane trip cost taxpayers $250,000,” wailed a media that was rarely critical of Michelle Obama’s million-dollar junkets with Sasha and Malia.</p> <p>The president took credit for Pence’s walkout, tweeting, “I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled.”</p> <p>Pence’s statement: “I left today’s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.”</p> <p>As Pence had left his press pool in the motorcade, and said he might not be too long, the walkout may not have been entirely spontaneous. But the game had been on Pence’s calendar for weeks.</p> <p>What does this episode tell us?</p> <p>In the culture wars, Trump has rejected compromise or capitulation and decided to defend the ground on which his most loyal folks stand.</p> <p>Example: While The Washington Post was reporting Monday that Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, and Denver had now joined Los Angeles in replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous People’s Day, Trump issued a Columbus Day proclamation of bristling defiance.</p> <p>“Five hundred and twenty-five years ago, Christopher Columbus completed an ambitious and daring voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. … a remarkable and then-unparalleled feat that helped launch the age of exploration and discovery. The permanent arrival of Europeans to the Americas was a transformative event that … changed the course of human history and set the stage for the development of our great Nation.”</p> <p>Columbus, said Trump, was a “skilled navigator and man of faith, whose courageous feat brought together continents and has inspired countless others to pursue their dreams and convictions — even in the face of extreme doubt and tremendous adversity.”</p> <p>The Admiral of the Ocean Sea “was a native of the City of Genoa, in present day Italy, and represents the rich history of important Italian American contributions to our great Nation. … Italy is a strong ally and a valued partner,” said Trump.</p> <p>His proclamation failed to mention indigenous peoples.</p> <p>How did CNN receive it? Not at all well.</p> <p>“Trump’s Praise of Columbus Omits Dark History,” ran the CNN headline. Lede sentence: “Never mind the disease and slavery wrought by Christopher Columbus’ voyage — or the fact that he didn’t actually ‘discover’ the New World.”</p> <p>Trump’s proclamation closed a week in which he rolled back the Obamacare mandate requiring employers and institutions, against their religious beliefs, to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing pills to employees.</p> <p>Religious groups cheered. The ACLU fumed. The in-your-face defiance of the dictates of political correctness has solidified Trump’s base behind him.</p> <p>And Americans are coming to accept our new reality: On the essentials of nationhood — ancestry, morality, faith, culture, history, heroes — we really are no longer one nation and one people.</p> <p>All weekend, viewers of cable TV were treated to self-righteous wailing from the acolytes of Colin Kaepernick, patron saint of the 49ers, that “taking the knee” to protest racism and racist cops is a most admirable exercise of the First Amendment right to protest.</p> <p>What Trump’s folks are saying in response is this:</p> <p>“You may have a First Amendment right to disrespect our flag, or even to burn it, but you have no right to make us listen to you, or respect you, or buy tickets to your games, or watch you on Sunday.”</p> <p>And with shrinking audiences watching NFL games, declining attendance, and advertisers beginning to bail, the NFL appears belatedly to be getting the message.</p> <p>Jerry Jones, owner of one of the most valuable franchises in the league, has told players that anyone who does not show respect for the flag during the national anthem does not play that day for the Dallas Cowboys.</p> <p>“President Trump has a duty to unite us, not divide us” is the mantra of our elites. Yet since the ’60s, it is these elites who have been imposing the social, moral, and cultural revolution the American people never voted for and which has by now divided us irretrievably.</p> <p>Call them “deplorables” if you will, but Trump does seem to relish going out to defend the views, values, and beliefs of the people who put him where he is. He does not recoil from political conflict.</p> <p>People who stand by you in a fight are not all that common in politics. When Trump exhibits this quality, he receives in reciprocity the kind of loyalty even his enemies concede he has.</p> <p>Patrick J. Buchanan is the author of a new book, “Nixon’s White House Wars: The Battles That Made and Broke a President and Divided America Forever.”</p></article>

I reproduce it here with his permission, and with the names of the people involved and the school redacted:</p> <q> <p>Dear [Principal],</p> <p>Raising little ones is hard these days, particularly because — even by ages five and six — kids on the playground are educating them about topics I didn’t even know much about until I was a preteen. Consequently, my wife and I began talking to the girls about sexuality in age-appropriate ways last year. It’s a sensitive area, but we wanted to go ahead and introduce our values to them early on, before a kid at school did and potentially caused confusion.</p> <p>In that spirit, last weekend I decided to talk to the girls about the topic of people who identify as transgendered. Shortly after starting the conversation, however, I learned that [their teacher] had already talked to [our daughter] and her classmates about it. This involved her reading a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/I-Am-Jazz-Jessica-Herthel/dp/0803741073/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503582608&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=i+am+jazz" type="external">“I Am Jazz”</a>and conducting a classroom discussion on the topic.</p> <p>First of all, let me say this: [my wife] and I think a lot of [the teacher]. She has been an excellent teacher and [our daughter] has seen great progress in her class. Furthermore, she has made a point to encourage us and compliment [our daughter’s] progress anytime she sees us. She’s a good and professional teacher, and I suppose that’s part of the reason we were so disappointed. We wouldn’t have expected it from her. And even though I’m sure she meant well, those good intentions don’t make [our daughter’s] experience any more appropriate, especially because I had already let the school know my wishes about any such discussion with the students.</p> <p>Before enrolling the girls, I explicitly told you that if there was any reason the school felt the need to discuss topics including sexuality, marriage norms, or gender identity, I wanted to be notified so that my children could be excused, giving me the opportunity to decide when they were ready for that discussion. You assured me that the school would never even broach these subjects with the kids. Just to be on the safe side, however, at our home visits, I also explicitly told the teachers the same.</p> <p>The classroom was not the place to conduct a discussion like this with first graders — the home is. [Our daughter] was confused by the discussion and book, and it required me to spend 20 minutes just to undo the odd and incorrect conclusions she drew about transgendered individuals from [the teacher’s] lesson and even the storyline of the book. That confusion could’ve been avoided by giving parents notification beforehand or not even discussing it at all with first graders.</p> <p>The sad thing is that I would’ve never even known it happened if I hadn’t decided to have this conversation that, quite frankly, I thought might be a little too mature for their ages. But we can’t unspill the milk, so I am asking you to do the following to make things right: (1) notify all parents about what happened so they can have a chance to discuss this with their own children; (2) apologize to all of us for exploring this topic with our kids without seeking our permission; (3) inform all parents of any other instances in which such a discussion happened or any comments were made regarding gender identity, marriage norms, and sexuality; and (4) let us know what remedial measures the school will take to ensure this will not happen again.</p> <p>Despite the excellent job you all are otherwise doing, this was a violation of every parents’ trust and rooted in the assumption that we are all in agreement with the ideology of the staff members. But more importantly and fundamentally, even if parents are in agreement with the ideology of staff members, this decision assumed that the school, rather than parents, is in the best position to decide when to approach hard topics like this with our children.</p> <p>It is not my intent to discourage [the teacher] at all — again, we have otherwise been so pleased with her work with [our daughter] this year; but I just can’t overlook this breach of trust and I think other parents also have a right to know it happened so they can address it at home as necessary. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p> </q> <p>Having not heard from the principal, the father wrote:</p> <q> <p>[Principal], [my wife] and I were hoping to hear back from you about our email to you. Maybe it would be better if we met in person. When are you available in the next two weeks?</p> </q> <p>The principal responded:</p> <q> <p>We are the height of planning for school opening. My apologies I did not respond sooner.</p> <p>As a mother and school leader, I can empathize with the challenge of keeping up with what our children are exposed to and wanting to be their first teacher on so many issues.</p> <p>I also think well of [the teacher]. She has shown herself to be a proficient teacher and student advocate.</p> <p>I do not recall a conversation about how we would handle conversations about transgender issues, but I cannot imagine agreeing either to censure such material or inform you in advance. I am sorry if [the teacher] or I led you to believe such a request would be honored.</p> <p>The book used is one that is a respected text in honoring the diversity of our children. It is a text that explains a real situation that many children face in self-acceptance, acceptance by others and being true to themselves. We feel the classroom is the appropriate place to share such messages.</p> <p>We would not request that these themes require permission, or clearance with families. (Different than courses on sexual education, for which we do require permission.) Quite the contrary, families have asked that we enhance our curriculum to be more inclusive of all the different groups our children and families represent, and we feel that this book achieves this purpose.</p> <p>I stand by [the teacher’s] use of the book in class, her decision to share the text, and the importance of these texts in the elementary classroom.</p> <p>I am happy to meet with you to listen or answer any other questions you might have. My time is limited in this month, but I will do my best.</p> </q> <p>The father replied:</p> <q> <p>Thanks for getting back in touch with me, [principal]. I realize that you are busy, but do you mind meeting with [my wife] and me briefly before the week is over? We would like to tie up the discussion, but we think it might contribute to mutual understanding if we do it in person.</p> </q> <p>The principal replied:</p> <q> <p>I am not available until the school year begins as we are feverishly working to train teachers, prepare the building and open school.</p> <p>I am copying [my assistant] who can help us set up something for the first week of school.</p> </q> <p>To which the father wrote:</p> <q> <p>We still want to get together with you, but if we aren’t able to talk before the school year begins, we would at least like to make sure we understood your email correctly.</p> <p>[My wife] and I would like our children to be exempt from any classroom discussions or instruction relating to the topics of gender identity, marital norms, or sexuality. We would also like to be informed before any such discussions take place in the classroom. I would like to know if the school will honor that request.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for letting us know. We know that these are sensitive topics that require great care, which is why we want to be the first ones to talk to our children about it.</p> </q> <p>The principal did not respond. Six days later, the father wrote:</p> <q> <p>[Principal], I appreciate how busy you are right now, but if you could please answer the question I emailed last week, I would appreciate it. Good luck with school prep!</p> </q> <p>The principal responded:</p> <q> <p>Thank you for understanding that this is an extremely busy time. I will not exempt any child from classroom discussions or instruction relating to the topics of gender identity, and ‘marital norms’.</p> <p>As it relates to formal instruction regarding sexuality, and sexual reproduction I will ask for your permission before these concepts are introduced in 4th grade. When they are introduced, I can say they are conducted with cultural humility and inclusivity– thoughtful of all our children and all their families.</p> </q> <p>The parents removed their two children from this public charter school last week in light of the principal’s refusal to respect their wishes or even to tell them when gender identity is going to be discussed in their elementary school classes.</p> <p>I asked the father if he wanted to go public with this, naming the school — in which case I would need to use their names, and call the principal and the teacher for comment. He said no, that they don’t want a public fight over this issue:</p> <q> <p>We just want to raise awareness and encourage parents to ask their children direct questions about this kind of stuff. If I hadn’t brought up this topic with my daughter, I would’ve never known what she was exposed to, nor would I have known that the school was systematically indoctrinating kids and doing so behind the backs of parents who had asked them to do otherwise.</p> </q> <p>Let this be a lesson to you, reader. Do you know what your child’s school’s policy is? Do you know what your child’s teacher thinks about introducing gender ideology to little children? You had better.</p> <p>Note too, per Joy Pullman, that the campaign to institute gender ideology in elementary schools is not stopping at public schools or at public charter schools. Via the accreditation process, they’re going after private schools. Pullman writes:</p> <q> <p>The leftists harping on this topic are essentially demanding a religious litmus test — the adoption of the moral belief that every sexual practice must be affirmed — as a precondition for educating children. It is starting with public and private schools, but will eventually encompass “outliers” such as homeschoolers. None of us are safe unless we band together and stop this crazy train in its tracks.</p> <p>A key problem is that Republican-led statehouses are the ones guarding school choice programs, and these same statehouses can barely muster the votes to protect children in public schools from being forced into unisex shower and sleeping quarters.</p> </q> <p>I have been told by people involved in this fight that Republican state legislators are getting hammered hard by the big business lobby, which wants to see liberalization of the schools on the SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) front. If these legislators do not hear from their constituents, they will rightly assume that the people they represent don’t care about the issue — and they’ll cave. If this matters to you as a parent, educate yourself — and call your state legislator. If you homeschool or have your kids in a private religious school, do not think that you are safe. (If you don’t belong to the <a href="https://www.hslda.org/" type="external">Homeschool Legal Defense Association</a>, join it now.)</p> <p>The other side is not playing around — and it has deep pockets (e.g., The Gates Foundation). In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Benedict-Option-Strategy-Christians-Post-Christian/dp/0735213291/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1498066936&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=benedict+option" type="external">The Benedict Option</a>, I call on Christians to prepare themselves, their communities, and their children to hold on to the truth a world in which this moral insanity is the norm. There is no way to avoid it. I also urge them to use whatever political power we have left to fight for religious liberty, which includes the right to have control over what their children are taught in the classroom on matters as fundamental as what it means to be male and female.</p> <p>Social and religious conservatives have lost many battles on this front, but they have not yet lost this one. But you had better be clear that the battle is here — and, as these parents above have learned, in some places it has been joined without parents even knowing what was happening. You cannot afford to be ignorant, nor can you afford to be indifferent. Never, ever forget that the Law Of Merited Impossibility is an infallible guide to progressivist culture war tactics: “It will never happen, and when it does, you bigots will deserve it.”</p> <p>If your child’s teacher has read I Am Jazz to her, and she wants to know whatever happened to Jazz Jennings, you may want to know that Jennings spoke about this in the media earlier this summer, and has been on the I Am Jazz reality show <a href="http://people.com/tv/jazz-jennings-sex-vagina-talk-parents/" type="external">discussing vaginas at the dinner table</a>. This is the culture we live in now:</p> screen shot <p>UPDATE: Reader Brendan:</p> <q> <p>I understand the call to arms on this, I really do, but I think that the battle on this has already been quite well and truly lost. The cultural Zeitgeist on this issue has a very “year before Obergefell” feeling to it — in other words, the battle was already over in everything but a formal and official way, and most everyone knew it. It’s the same for this issue — for all practical purposes this is over.</p> <p>Are there more people squeamish about MTF transwomen in the ladies room today than there were about gay marriage in, say, 2013? Probably. But that sentiment is being very exceptionally and forcefully forced into silence, just as the sentiments about SSM were.</p> <p>The reason is more or less the same as it was for SSM: corporate America wants it, for several reasons ranging from not wanting to alienate customers who are millenials (who are extremely pro-trans) to not wanting to seem like bigots to their socio-economic peers at the cocktail party. LGBT is a main corporate, capitalist priority currently, and it’s getting pretty much the full support of almost all big enterprises. This makes the issue politically impossible, because the Democrats of course are in bed with LGBT, while the Republicans will generally do what big business wants, which in this case (as in the case of SSM) is pro-LGBT. In that context, there really isn’t any way a fight can really be won here on this issue at this point.</p> <p>At the end of the day, what parents think on this issue doesn’t matter. What matters is what big business thinks, what the mainstream media thinks, what the Academy thinks and so on. Parents don’t rate, and they will be made to comply with their betters. Just watch.</p> </q></article>

The conservative ones formulate opinions and make arguments based on ideas and principles. The liberal ones, though, base their arguments (such as they are) on an assertion of identity (e.g., “Speaking as a lesbian of color, I believe that…”). Lilla goes on:</p> <q> <p>Conservatives complain loudest about today’s campus follies, but it is really liberals who should be angry. The big story is not that leftist professors successfully turn millions of young people into dangerous political radicals every year. It is that they have gotten students so obsessed with their personal identities that, by the time they graduate, they have much less interest in, and even less engagement with, the wider political world outside their heads.</p> <p>There is a great irony in this. The supposedly bland, conventional universities of the 1950s and early ’60s incubated the most radical generation of American citizens perhaps since our founding. Young people were incensed by the denial of voting rights out there, the Vietnam War out there, nuclear proliferation out there, capitalism out there, colonialism out there. Yet once that generation took power in the universities, it proceeded to depoliticize the liberal elite, rendering its members unprepared to think about the common good and what must be done practically to secure it—especially the hard and unglamorous task of persuading people very different from themselves to join a common effort.</p> <p>Every advance of liberal identity consciousness has marked a retreat of liberal political consciousness. There can be no liberal politics without a sense of We—of what we are as citizens and what we owe each other. If liberals hope ever to recapture America’s imagination and become a dominant force across the country, it will not be enough to beat the Republicans at flattering the vanity of the mythical Joe Sixpack. They must offer a vision of our common destiny based on one thing that all Americans, of every background, share.</p> <p>And that is citizenship. We must relearn how to speak to citizens as citizens and to frame our appeals for solidarity—including ones to benefit particular groups—in terms of principles that everyone can affirm.</p> </q> <p>And:</p> <q> <p>Black Lives Matter is a textbook example of how not to build solidarity. By publicizing and protesting police mistreatment of African-Americans, the movement delivered a wake-up call to every American with a conscience. But its decision to use this mistreatment to build a general indictment of American society and demand a confession of white sins and public penitence only played into the hands of the Republican right.</p> <p>I am not a black male motorist and will never know what it is like to be one. If I am going to be affected by his experience, I need some way to identify with him, and citizenship is the only thing I know that we share. The more the differences between us are emphasized, the less likely I will be to feel outrage at his mistreatment.</p> <p>The politics of identity has done nothing but strengthen the grip of the American right on our institutions. It is the gift that keeps on taking. Now is the time for liberals to do an immediate about-face and return to articulating their core principles of solidarity and equal protection for all. Never has the country needed it more.</p> </q> <p>The essay is adapted from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Once-Future-Liberal-Identity-Politics/dp/0062697439/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502471919&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=once+and+future+liberal" type="external">The Once And Future Liberal</a>, the new book by Lilla, which will be out next week. I’ve read it. It’s short, punchy, and challenging. I think we conservatives have a lot to learn from it too. I’ll be writing about that next week.</p> <p>The Damore debacle at Google is a perfect example of what Lilla disdains in his book. Google engineer James Damore wrote an impolitic memo criticizing the way diversity is handled at Google. He said there are scientific reasons why Google’s diversity initiatives aren’t working to change Google’s male-female employee ratio. He said clearly that he favors diversity, but thinks that science shows there are more effective ways to achieve it. And he criticized Google for being the kind of place where people who disagree with cultural progressivism cannot speak out.</p> <p>This got him fired. It also energized the mob of left-wing witch hunters, who piled onto Damore for his alleged sexist bigotry. Much of the hysteria had nothing to do with Damore’s actual arguments. It bashed him on identity politics grounds. Never mind that Damore said in the memo that he favors diversity, and that he thinks racism and sexism are real problems. Never mind that he simply complained that the way Google pursues diversity is unfair to men. And never mind that Google provided the internal forum precisely so that its workers can discuss workplace issues. (These three facts, by the way, are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/james-damore-may-win-nlra-legal-case-google-2017-8" type="external">why Damore might well be vindicated</a>in his complaint filed against Google with the National Labor Relations Board.)</p> <p>Very few of us outside of the scientific community are in a position to discuss intelligently the science involved in this dispute. True, some scientists have weighed in to say that Damore is on solid scientific ground in his memo (which doesn’t mean it was a wise thing to share, given the cultural politics of the workplace). My guess is that most ordinary people see this case and wonder why it is that we can’t discuss Damore’s actual argument. Why was a guy who agreed with his company’s diversity goal but not with how the company goes about trying to achieve that result fired simply for arguing — based on science! — that there is a better and more just way to achieve that goal?</p> <p>How does this relate to Lilla’s argument? In this way. James Damore made a reasoned argument in his memo. <a href="https://diversitymemo.com" type="external">Read it for yourself and see.</a> That doesn’t mean James Damore’s conclusions are correct. Perhaps his premises are mistaken, or maybe his logic is wrong. That did not matter to Google, whose vice president for diversity denounced Damore for advancing “incorrect assumptions about gender.” Google’s president fired him for “advancing harmful gender stereotypes.”</p> <p>Sacramento Bee columnist <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/ben-boychuk/article166515342.html" type="external">Ben Boychuk points out how old-fashioned liberalism doesn’t stand a chance anymore:</a></p> <q> <p>Any conservative who read James Damore’s memo recognized at once that he holds fairly conventional liberal views of the world. But even conventional liberal viewpoints are no longer safe.</p> <p>Damore did not claim women are “biologically unsuited” to work in tech (as, I regret to report, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article166174322.html" type="external">The Bee’s editorial asserted this week</a>). He didn’t even argue against racial or gender diversity per se. On the contrary, he took pains to make clear in his opening paragraph that he values “diversity and inclusion,” does not deny “sexism exists” and doesn’t “endorse using stereotypes.”</p> <p>Then what did he say? In brief, that Google’s efforts to achieve 50-50 parity between male and female programmers were unlikely to succeed because a lot of women simply aren’t interested in science and technology fields.</p> <p>And why aren’t they interested? Not because they’re “biologically unsuited” but rather because there are biological differences that lead men and women down different paths.</p> <p>Mind you, Damore doesn’t say he’s against the company’s goals for greater gender diversity; he simply argues that the executives are going about it the wrong way.</p> </q> <p>And that is still enough to get him fired. Why? Because of the left’s identity politics, which keeps expanding the boundaries of things you cannot say, even if you can demonstrate that they’re true, or might well be true. So, when Lilla says that “the politics of identity has done nothing but strengthen the grip of the American right on our institutions,” the Damore debacle provides him with a great example.</p> <p>In her <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-google-memo-women-tech-20170811-story.html" type="external">superb commentary on the matter,</a> Megan McArdle talks about her own experience working as a tech consultant in the finance world, an industry heavily dominated by males, and how yes, it was more challenging as a woman because of the bros. But that’s not why she left that career. She left because the guys were a lot more committed to techie things than she was. She was good enough to do that kind of work, but she just didn’t have the same passion for it that her male colleagues do. So she went to work in a field that she did love with the same kind of passion.</p> <p>And that, she said, is what’s at the core of James Damore’s argument: not that women are biologically unable to do tech work, but that the kind of detailed work tech personnel at Google do disproportionately attracts males — and that is bound to affect diversity efforts. Yet McArdle says that even if you concede Damore’s point, it’s still probably the case that a lopsided workplace culture can be an unfriendly place for women — and this is a problem.</p> <p>She ends like this:</p> <q> <p>And yet, you still have to ask whether shamestorming Damore and getting him sacked was really the best way to convince him — or anyone else — that he’s mistaken. Did anyone’s understanding of the complex quandaries of gender diversity advance? If there were guys at Google wondering whether the women around them really deserved their jobs, did anyone wake up the morning after Damore’s firing with the revelation: “Good God, how could I have been so blind?” No, I suspect those guys are now thinking: “You see? Women can’t handle math or logic.”</p> <p>The mob reaction did prove that women indeed have some power in tech. But the power to fire people is not why most people get into engineering. Good engineers want to make things. The conversation around Damore’s memo hasn’t made the world a better place, as they say in Silicon Valley. It has just made a lot of people angry.</p> </q> <p>Yes, and it has probably made a lot of people more likely to vote Republican next time. Mark Lilla can explain why.</p></article>
	<article id="0000966" published-at="2017-01-30" title="Is President Trump's Immigration Order a 'Muslim Ban'?">
Carlos Barria / Reuters <p>Imagine the following scenario.</p> <p>A new presidential administration announces that “political turmoil and terrorism” in the Middle East requires new immigration rules.</p> <p>From now on, visitors, immigrants and refugees from Israel will not be admitted.</p> <p>With one exception, that is—believers in “minority religions” within the Jewish state (this is, most prominently, Christians and Muslims) will be allowed to enter, because they are being persecuted at home.</p> <p>Accused of anti-Semitism, the new administration is aghast. How could you even suspect that? Look—Jews from elsewhere in the world are free to enter—even from other countries with large Jewish populations! It’s purely geographic! (With a small humanitarian exception, of course.) No religious test at all, just a desire to keep America safe. Move along, nothing to see.</p> <p>Are you buying it so far?</p> <p>Okay, what if we throw in these additional facts:</p> <p>The new president ran for office on a pledge to bar Jews from entering the United States. And the proclamation makes no mention of Judaism but specifically mentions that one of the problems with immigrants from Israel (except, of course, Christians and Muslims) is that they discriminate against women and look down on other religions.</p> <p>What if a presidential adviser states that the president asked him to write a ban on Jewish immigrants that would seem legal?</p> <p>Does “purely geographic” still pass the laugh test?</p> <p>The constitutionality of Trump’s order shutting down refugee admissions, and barring any immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations, is a complicated question. Immigration is a highly specialized constitutional area. But a constitutional lawyer would first ask: Is this, as the president has claimed, a “geographic” order, targeting certain countries “compromised by terrorism”? Or is it a “religious test,” intentionally singling out one religion for adverse treatment?</p> <p>The answer can be constitutionally quite important. In order to violate the Constitution’s requirement of “equal protection of the laws,” a government measure must intentionally discriminate on the basis of a given trait. In this case, the question is whether the order intentionally discriminates against Muslims.</p> <p>Over the years, the courts have developed a set of tests to find “intentional discrimination.” They are necessary because governments often deny any intent to discriminate against a group or on the basis of a trait. (Certainly the administration denies that now.) Lawyers first look at the precise terms of a government regulation; then they look at its structure and exceptions; then they look at statements made by decision-makers; then they look at the events and procedures surrounding its adoption.</p> <p>The executive order fails every one of these tests. This is a religious “classification” that intentionally discriminates against Muslims—because of hostility to their religion.</p> <p>These facts of my hypothetical precisely match Trump’s order. The order states as a reason for its restrictions a desire to exclude “those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including ‘honor’ killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own).” Though “honor killings” is not linked to any religion, its inclusion here is a dog whistle, because the term has been used by Islamophobes who claim (falsely) that it characterizes Muslim society generally.</p> <p>"The order also allows immigration officials to continue to admit refugees--including refugees from the seven predominantly Muslim countries otherwise banned––on a “case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest—including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution.” <a type="internal">*</a> In case that last clause was unclear, Trump then announced that it was intended to give priority to Middle Eastern Christians, because they have been “horribly treated,” and so “we are going to help them.”</p> <p>Candidate Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-the-united-states/?utm_term=.80a675f31664" type="external">loudly proposed</a> a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” Trump adviser Rudolph Giuliani has <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-giuliani-trump-muslim-ban-20170129-story.html" type="external">proudly boasted that the new president asked him to come up with a way of implementing a “Muslim ban” that would be “legal.”</a></p> <p>In a 1977 case called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_of_Arlington_Heights_v._Metropolitan_Housing_Development_Corp." type="external">Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp</a>., the Court laid out a set of procedural tests of a government decision: Is there a history of discrimination leading up to it? Were the specific events leading to the decision unusual? Did the new policy represent a sudden change in procedures and substance?</p> <p>Anti-Muslim discrimination (and hate crimes) are very much a part of recent American history. The specific events leading up to the surprise order were not just unusual but bizarre. Press reports indicate that the officials responsible for refugee policy (e.g., the secretary of homeland security, Gen. John Kelly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/politics/donald-trump-rush-immigration-order-chaos.html" type="external">) were not consulted or notified</a>. The new criteria represent a radical change in immigration and refugee policy.</p> <p>The fact that it does not exclude all Muslim immigrants doesn’t make it “neutral.” A rule barring Jews, but not others, from only one place still discriminates against Jews. Discrimination does not disappear simply because it is partial. The test is the intention, and the evidence of intent is plentiful here.</p> <p>Whether it’s legal, and constitutional, is a different question. But let’s not confuse ourselves:</p> <p>Yes, it’s a “Muslim ban.”</p> <p><a type="internal">*</a>This article originally stated that the executive order allowed immigration officials to admit refugees from the predominantly Muslim countries on a case-by-case basis; that provision applies to all refugees.

Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan slammed the "sanctuary state" practices going into law in California, saying that ICE will not back down and will enforce the federal immigration law in the state without apology. (Image Source: YouTube screenshot) <p>Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan slammed California for its “sanctuary city” policies that went into effect Jan. 1.</p> Here’s the interview from Fox News: Here’s what he said: <p>“Well look, if he thinks he’s protecting the immigrant community, he’s doing quite the opposite, because if you think ICE is going away, we’re not,” Homan said of California Gov. Jerry Brown.</p> <p>“There’s no sanctuary from federal law enforcement, as a matter of fact, we’re in the process now. I’m going to significantly increase our enforcement presence in California,” he explained. “We’re already doing it. We’re going to detail additional enforcement assets to California.”</p> <p>“California better hold on tight — they’re about to see a lot more special agents,” he added. “A lot more deportation orders in the state of California.”</p> <p>“If the politicians in California don’t want to protect their communities, then ICE will.”</p> <p>Homan went on to claim that the “street cops” in California are completely against the sanctuary state law, and offered an example of an illegal immigrant that committed murder after a city ignored a detention request from ICE.</p> <p>“We’re gonna be all over the place, and we’re going to enforce the law without apology,” he continued.</p> <p>“What I’m also doing is working with the Department of Justice — with these sanctuary cities that knowingly shield and harbor an illegal alien in their jail and don’t allow us access,” he added. Tthat is in my opinion, of 8 USC 1314, that’s an alien smuggling statute. I’ve asked the Department of Justice to look at this.”</p> <p>“Are these sanctuary cities? Can we hold them accountable? Are they violating federal law?” he asked. “So there’s more to come on that.”</p></article>

The publicist describes the lawyer as a "Russian government attorney" who has dirt on Clinton as "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump." In one response, Trump Jr. says he would "love" to hear more.</p> <p>President Donald Trump says his eldest son is "a high-quality person," and he applauds "his transparency."</p> <p>In a tweet Tuesday night, the president promoted his son's appearance on Fox News and called him a "great person who loves our country."</p> <q> <p>My son, Donald, will be interviewed by <a href="https://twitter.com/seanhannity" type="external">@seanhannity</a> tonight at 10:00 P.M. He is a great person who loves our country!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/884931352201756672" type="external">July 12, 2017</a> </q> <p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a brief statement from the president Tuesday in response to revelations that Trump Jr. agreed to hear damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's effort to help his father.</p> <p>Trump Jr., who was deeply involved in his father's presidential campaign, released the emails along with a statement describing the disclosure as an effort "to be totally transparent." The emails with publicist Rob Goldstone show that Trump Jr. was told that the Russian government had information that could "incriminate" Clinton and her dealings with Russia.</p> <q> <p>Here's my statement and the full email chain <a href="https://t.co/x050r5n5LQ" type="external">pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ</a></p>— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789418455953413" type="external">July 11, 2017</a> </q> <p>The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said sought to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. As congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, investigate, the emails will almost certainly be reviewed for any signs of potential campaign collusion with the Kremlin, which the White House has repeatedly denied.</p> <p>Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the emails, citing the ongoing investigation.</p> <q> <p>Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). <a href="https://t.co/z1Xi4nr2gq" type="external">pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gq</a></p>— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/884789839522140166" type="external">July 11, 2017</a> </q> <p>In the emails, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that the information "would be very useful to your father." Goldstone was working to connect Trump Jr. to Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who later met with Trump Jr. in New York at Trump Tower.</p> <p>Veselnitskaya has denied that she ever worked for the Russian government and said on Tuesday that she doesn't represent the Russian government, only herself. She also said she "couldn't have had" information on Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer," Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges the younger Trump posted to Twitter.</p> <p>The emails, dated early June, show Goldstone telling Trump that singer Emin Agalarov and his father, Moscow-based developer Aras Agalarov, had "helped along" the Russian government's support for Trump. The elder Agalarov was involved with Trump in hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. The two men also had preliminary discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow that fell through. Trump also appeared in a music video with the younger Agalarov.</p> <p>Goldstone at one point said he could send the information to Trump's father first directly "via Rhona," an apparent reference to the elder Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff.</p> <p>The email release followed days of evolving accounts from Trump Jr. about the nature of the meeting and its purpose. The president's son posted the emails only after they were obtained by The New York Times.</p> <p>On Saturday, Trump Jr. described the encounter as being a "short introductory meeting" focused on the disbanded program that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended the adoptions in response to Magnitsky Act sanctions created in response to alleged human rights violations in Russia.</p> <p>A day later, Trump Jr. changed his account, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information "helpful" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton.</p> <p>In his third description of what occurred, on Tuesday, Trump Jr. said he had believed the information he would hear about Clinton would be political opposition research. He said that he first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didn't work out, he was told that the attorney would be in New York "and I decided to take the meeting."</p> <p>"The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official," Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. "And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act."</p> <p>The Trump Organization has confirmed the authenticity of Trump Jr. posts on Twitter releasing the email chain.</p> <p>Associated Press writers Nekesa Mumbi Moody in New York and Julie Bykowicz in Washington contributed to this report.</p> Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

james damore google <p>He claimed that women are not "biologically" suited for leadership positions.</p> <p>If you’re not familiar with the name “James Damore,” you probably haven’t been on social media recently.</p> <p>If the name still doesn’t ring a bell, perhaps you know him better by the headlines he’s inspired — headlines like <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google" type="external">“Google Employee's Anti-Diversity Manifesto Goes 'Internally Viral'”</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/business/google-women-engineer-fired-memo.html" type="external">“Google Fires Engineer Who Wrote Memo Questioning Women in Tech.”</a></p> <p>The story was <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google" type="external">first reported on Vice’s Motherboard site</a> earlier this week — a software engineer, later revealed to be James Damore, posted a 10-page manifesto document to an internal discussion group for employees which criticized recent diversity hiring initiatives at <a type="internal">Google, one of the biggest technology companies in the world.</a></p> <p>The memo argued that “ideological diversity” was more important than gender diversity and that women are not as “biologically” suited for work in technology or leadership positions.</p> <p>Perhaps predictably, many people at Google objected to the suggestion that female employees were biologically inferior to male employees, inspiring several of them to lambast Damore’s arguments on social media and share the manifesto with news sites.</p> <p>You can read Damore’s full document, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320" type="external">titled “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber” here,</a> but the primary cause for the backlash against his memo stems from his argument that diversity hiring initiatives hurt men (rather than helping women).</p> <p>Here are some excerpts from his memo:</p> … women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. … This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up, and leading. … humans are generally biased towards protecting females. … Once we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve problems. … I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. <p>(Motherboard created an excellent breakdown of the sources that Damore cites in his argument, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evzjww/here-are-the-citations-for-the-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-at-google" type="external">which you can read here</a>.)</p> <p>Following the reveal of Damore’s memo (and his identity), a number of things happened in quick succession:</p> <p>First, Danielle Brown, Google’s Vice President of Diversity, Integrity and Governance, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-google-memo-20170807-story.html" type="external">issued a statement, which criticized Damore’s document</a> for advancing “incorrect assumptions about gender.” She also stated that employees should “feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws.”</p> <p>Next, her statement was quickly followed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/google-fires-memo-author/" type="external">a company-wide email titled “Our Words Matter” from Google’s chief executive officer, Sundar Pichai,</a> who announced that Damore had been fired for violating the company’s code of conduct and “advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.”</p> <p>The announcement of Damore’s firing, however, swiftly became almost as divisive as the reaction to his original memo.</p> <p>Damore told various news outlet that he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/technology/google-engineer-fired-gender-memo.html" type="external">considering legal action, telling The New York Times that,</a> “I have a legal right to express my concerns about the terms and conditions of my working environment and to bring up potentially illegal behavior, which is what my document does.”</p> <p>While it remains unclear if Damore, as an at-will employee, did have the legal right to make his statements about gender without fear of repercussions from his employer — or how diversity programs can be seen as “illegal behavior” — his termination quickly turned the engineer into martyr figure for anti-censorship and <a type="internal">alt-right groups online.</a></p> <p>Here are just a few of the subsequent tweets and Reddit posts, which have labeled Damore as a wrongly maligned hero — largely from people who agree with his views on <a type="internal">diversity and gender.</a></p> <p>(Alternately, Gizmodo uncovered evidence that <a href="http://gizmodo.com/fired-google-memo-writer-took-part-in-controversial-s-1797658885" type="external">Damore took place in a “sexist” skit during his time at Harvard University,</a> which was considered offensive enough at the time that the administration issued a formal apology.)</p> <p>However, not all of Damore’s support has been coming from Twitter and Reddit lurkers. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange tweeted support of Damore and offered him a job:</p> <p>Additionally, alt-right crowdfunding groups <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/08/the_ascent_of_google_employee_james_damore_to_free_speech_martyr_was_inevitable.html" type="external">have begun raising money for Damore,</a> the conservative National Review <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/450237/google-anti-diversity-memo-threatens-political-correctness-religion" type="external">compared the engineer to Martin Luther,</a> and several other pundits have claimed that Damore was fired for deviating “from the talking points of the liberal left" ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-diversity-idUSKBN1AO1WY" type="external">to quote Andrea Torba,</a> CEO of Gab).</p> <p>The whole ugly incident is showing how divided we are, as a society, when it comes our opinions on gender and censorship.</p> <q/> <p>Some outlets are arguing that all Damore did was “point out <a type="internal">the differences between men and women,</a>” but others claim that Damore’s arguments aren’t based on fact and are discriminatory in nature.</p> <p>(One wonders what the reaction would’ve been if Damore argued that certain races — rather than genders — were more inclined to succeed in leadership and tech positions.)</p> <p>There definitely does not seem to be any scientific consensus backing the legitimacy of Damore’s biological claims that women aren’t suited for the tech industry (quite the contrary), so is posting specious theories about gender enough to justify his firing?</p> <p>Or does Google retain the right to fire any employee for any reason? Does a privately-owned company actually have to guarantee their employees the right to free speech on any topic, during company time, using company resources?</p> <p>One suspects these topics will be debated to death during any legal action Damore might bring against Google, but, in the meantime, his memo and his firing have ignited a social media firestorm about free speech and political correctness in the workplace.</p></article>
	<article id="0000972" published-at="2017-12-22" title="Bombshell Report Reveals Up To 30% Of Federal Inmates Are Illegal Immigrants"><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Alien_Incarceration_Report_OIS_FY17_Q4_2.pdf" type="external">its findings</a> on the immigration status of federal prison inmates, as mandated in a controversial Executive Order signed during the President Trump's first week in the White House. The report reveals that of the 37,557 confirmed immigrants in the federal prison system, 35,334 (94%) of them are in the United States illegally - which means out of a total of <a href="http://archive.is/Fas6u" type="external">185,507</a>, federally incarcerated individuals, over 19% are confirmed illegal immigrants - which, in 2014, cost U.S. taxpayers <a href="http://archive.is/5AUQw" type="external">$1.87 billion to house</a>.</p> <p>It should be noted that the 19% figure is based on known illegals in federal prison - while 58,766 individuals are "known or suspected" to be illegal. If we apply the 94% confirmed illegal rate to the "known or suspected" population, it brings the total number of potential incarcerated illegal immigrants to 55,240 - or 30% of federal incarcerations.</p> <a type="internal"/> (DHS Alien Incarceration Report , Q4 2017) <p>The report also points out that the federal prison population is roughly 10%, with state and local facilities containing the vast majority of incarcerated individuals in the U.S.</p> <p>"The American people deserve a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest," <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-homeland-security-release-data-incarcerated-aliens-94-percent-all" type="external">said Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a>, adding "But at the border and in communities across America, our citizens are being victimized by illegal aliens who commit crimes. Nearly 95 percent of confirmed aliens in our federal prisons are here illegally. We know based on sentencing data that non-citizens commit a substantially disproportionate number of drug-related offenses, which contributes to our national drug abuse crisis. The simple fact is that any offense committed by a criminal alien is ultimately preventable."</p> <p>Immigrant rights groups predictably had a major problem with the report, claiming racism and manipulated data.</p> <p>"The report proves one thing only: The administration will take any opportunity possible to twist facts to demonize immigrants," said Tom Jawetz, VP for immigration policy at the very liberal Center for American Progress, adding "The vast majority of immigrants in federal prison are there for crimes that only immigrants can be charged with - illegal entry and illegal entry after removal. When you cook the books you shouldn't pretend to be surprised by the results."</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>The January 25th <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united-states/" type="external">Executive Order</a>, 13768; "Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States," was designed to use all available resources to deport incarcerated illegals and enforce existing immigration laws. The order states "We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States."</p> <p>The order calls for the hire of 10,000 additional immigration officers, allows for issuing fines and penalties to unlawful aliens, allows State and local law enforcement agencies to act as immigration officers, and yanks Federal grant money from sanctuary cities - which was later reversed nationwide by a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/sessions-can-t-deny-grant-money-sanctuary-cities-judge-says-n801846" type="external">Chicago judge</a> and ruled unconstitutional by Santa Clara County, CA judge William Orrick III.</p> <p>What wasn't killed by activist judges, however, was the Executive Order's mandate to provide quarterly reports on incarcerated immigrants. The EO reads:</p> <q> <p>To promote the transparency and situational awareness of criminal aliens in the United States, the Secretary and the Attorney General are hereby directed to collect relevant data and provide quarterly reports on the following:</p> <p>(a) the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons;</p> <p>(b) the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated as Federal pretrial detainees under the supervision of the United States Marshals Service; and</p> <p>(c) the immigration status of all convicted aliens incarcerated in State prisons and local detention centers throughout the United States.</p> </q> <p>The Order also sets out enforcement actions, which "shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress... ...removable aliens who:</p> <q> <p>(a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense;</p> <p>(b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;</p> <p>(c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;</p> <p>(d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;</p> <p>(e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits;</p> <p>(f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or</p> <p>(g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.</p> </q> <p>One oustanding question now is what will a seemingly sleepwalking Jeff Sessions do about it?</p> <p>In May, Sessions announced the expansion and modernization of the Justice Department's Institutional Hearing Program, which is responsible for deportation hearings of incarcerated individuals. The measures are intended to fast-track the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, which according to Sessions, will speed up the process by removing the criminal immigrant as soon as their sentence is complete - as opposed to sending them to another facility to await deportation.</p> <p>"We owe it to the American people to ensure that illegal aliens who have been convicted of crimes and are serving time in our federal prisons are expeditiously removed from our country as the law requires," Sessions said in a statement.</p> <p>Sessions' May proposal established 14 federal prisons and six contract facilities for deportation proceedings, which the Attorney General says is a top priority going forward.</p></article>

	<article id="0000976" title="How Trump Has Influenced Prevention Of Harriet Tubman’s Image On $20 Bill">
The bill to place Harriet Tubman’s face on the $20 is apparently in limbo. <p>Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary; recently said that he wouldn’t commit to executing the Obama administration’s agenda to feature Harriet Tubman’s image on the $20 bill. He claimed that he hadn’t yet decided on a cause of action on the matter.</p> <p>Mnuchin added that the decision would be more focused on how to design the $20 currency in a manner that prevents counterfeiting, than whose image is on the bill.</p> <p>“Eventually we will be looking into this issue,” Mnuchin stated. “It isn’t something I am focused on currently.”</p> <p>Mnuchin went saying “the issues of why we should change it will be mainly related to what we have to do for the security reasons.”</p> <p>Last year, President Barack Obama and Jacob Lew, the Treasury Secretary of that time—proposed to take the image of President Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill and then replace it with that of Harriet Tubman.</p> <p>Tubman is a famous abolitionist who assisted many enslaved people to escape. If everything goes as planned; Tubman would be the first Black-American and the first female to appear on U.S. currency, in more than a century. (Martha Washington was featured on silver certificates back in the late 19th century.)</p> <p>Lew’s plan explained that Tubman’s image would be placed on the front side of the $20 bill. And then that of Jackson would appear on the opposite of the currency.</p> <p>The America’s treasury department had earlier made an announcement that seemed to convince that they were ready to put Harriet Tubman portrait on the front of the $20 currency.</p> <p>However, President Donald Trump has made it clear that he is very fond of Jackson. He said it at times when he was remarking that his election was reminiscent of the populist campaign of 1829 that ascended Jackson into power. Trump even has an image of Jackson on the wall—in the Oval Office.</p> <p>In the last year interview with NBC, President Trump said that although Tubman was “fantastic,” putting her on the $20 currency was exemplifying “pure political incorrectness.”</p> <p>“Well. Andrew Jackson had an incredible history, and I think it is very harsh when you take somebody one off, the bill,” said Trump. “I think Tubman is fantastic as well, but I would love us to leave Andrew Jackson or figure out if we can maybe find another denomination.”</p> <p>Read the original story <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/treasury-secretary-won-t-commit-to-plan-to-put-harriet/article_c9a7b600-65d6-5557-8f89-d6f6808bbc3c.html" type="external">here</a></p></article>
	<article id="0000977" published-at="2017-09-21" title="Report: Samantha Power made 260 requests last year to “unmask” Americans in intel reports"><p>That’s … a lotta unmasking. The fact that Samantha Power is at the heart of the “unmasking” investigation in the House barely qualifies as news at this point, as her name has been floating around in connection with it <a type="internal">for months</a>. In fact, Trey Gowdy quizzed John Brennan about a mysterious ambassador and her strange unmasking requests at a House hearing all the way back <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4671896/gowdy-asked-us-ambassador-helped-unmask" type="external">on May 23</a>. By mid-July the Free Beacon’s sources had identified her as a <a href="http://freebeacon.com/national-security/fmr-u-n-amb-power-emerges-central-figure-obama-unmasking-investigation/" type="external">“central figure” in the probe</a>. Note this quote from that piece:</p> <q> <p>“Unmasking is not a regular occurrence—absolutely not a weekly habit. It is rare, even at the National Security Council, and ought to be rarer still for a U.N. ambassador,” according to one former senior U.S. official who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon.</p> </q> <p>Well, it wasn’t a weekly habit for Power, if <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/20/samantha-power-sought-to-unmask-americans-on-almost-daily-basis-sources-say.html" type="external">Fox’s sources</a> are to be believed. It was a daily habit:</p> <a type="internal"/> Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? <q> <p>Samantha Power, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was ‘unmasking’ at such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016 – and even sought information in the days leading up to President Trump’s inauguration, multiple sources close to the matter told Fox News.</p> <p>Two sources, who were not authorized to speak on the record, said the requests to identify Americans whose names surfaced in foreign intelligence reporting, known as unmasking, exceeded 260 last year. One source indicated this occurred in the final days of the Obama White House.</p> </q> <p>When asked for comment, Power’s spokesman noted that she wasn’t just the ambassador to the UN, she was a member of the National Security Council. But so what? Note again what the senior official told the Free Beacon — even at the NSC, unmasking is rare. The Council also includes the head of OMB and the head of the National Economic Council, incidentally. Should Mick Mulvaney and Gary Cohn be unmasking American citizens in intelligence reports at will just because they’re members?</p> <p>Here’s an easy way to gauge whether Power’s practices were appropriate: How did her volume of unmasking requests stack up to Susan Rice’s and John Brennan’s? Rice was national security advisor, Brennan was head of the CIA. If anyone in the Obama administration had reason to be unmasking U.S. citizens for valid intelligence purposes, it was them. You’d certainly expect Brennan to have made more unmasking requests than someone more peripheral to the intelligence process, like Power. So let’s know the numbers. How many unmasking requests per week on average were Rice and Brennan filing compared to her?</p> <p>Another question: How many of Power’s requests were actually granted? An official can ask to have the redacted name of an American in an intelligence report revealed but it’s up to the FBI and NSA to grant that request. And they don’t do it lightly, as Fox notes:</p> <q> <p>“We [the NSA] apply two criteria in response to their request: number one, you must make the request in writing. Number two, the request must be made on the basis of your official duties, not the fact that you just find this report really interesting and you’re just curious,” [Mike Rogers] said in June. “It has to tie to your job and finally, I said two but there’s a third criteria, and is the basis of the request must be that you need this identity to understand the intelligence you’re reading.”</p> </q> <p>What was a UN ambassador doing in her “official duties” that required her to know the identities of so many Americans who turned up in intelligence reports? If it turns out she did in fact “just find this report really interesting” and was “just curious” and the NSA or FBI *granted* unmasking requests made along those lines then this scandal will blow up far beyond Power herself. A lone official trying to go rogue on intelligence by making a ridiculous number of unmasking requests is one thing. The FBI and NSA abetting her by granting those requests and outing Americans to someone who may have had no legitimate intelligence purpose in knowing who they are is another thing entirely. *If* that’s what happened here, Comey and Rogers will become the center of the probe, not Power. Why were their agencies not more exacting in demanding proper justification for unmasking, investigators will wonder, particularly given the alarming number of requests from Power and the fact that her job didn’t obviously require her to have this information?</p> <p>One point in Power’s defense, though. What are the odds that she would be allowed to go on making hundreds of improper unmasking requests without it leaking and with no one stopping her? If the FBI and NSA were rejecting her applications daily, you would think someone would have stepped in at some point and either told her to cool it or whispered to the papers that she was abusing the process. And if the FBI and NSA were granting most of her applications, it’s hard to believe they were so systematically crooked that they would risk their institutional reputations and a major scandal to rubber-stamp requests made by a figure as tangential to the natsec process as Power. This wasn’t Brennan or James Clapper demanding the information, it was a diplomat who spent most of her tenure impotently defending Obama’s impotent Syria policy. Would Comey and Rogers gamble their careers by looking the other way at improper applications made by her for months on end?</p> <p>Maybe Power had reason to suspect there were Americans working at the UN, maybe even on her own staff, who were quietly double-dealing with foreign powers in the building? That would be a legitimate intelligence purpose for unmasking, but why the UN ambassador would be left to make those requests instead of Brennan or Rice, I have no idea. American double agents at the UN would be a big deal, worthy of attention from the big cheeses of natsec.</p></article>

That would be bad enough but Hanlon also downplays and excuses the reasons for those excessive costs, i.e. violent, far left protesters like Antifa.</p> <a type="internal"/> Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? <q> <p>In a typical year, the University of California, Berkeley, allocates around $200,000 to pay for security at campus protests. But since this past February, the school has spent some <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-09-14/uc-berkeley-under-tight-security-for-conservative-speaker" type="external">$1.5 million</a>. That enormous sum excludes the $1 million the administration expected to spend this week on Milo Yiannopoulos’s chaotic and disorganized “Free Speech Week.”…</p> <p>And it raises a thorny question for those who believe that free speech should trump all else: Should public institutions be spending taxpayer money allocated for higher education on speakers who aren’t there for teaching and learning?</p> </q> <p>Hanlon is correct that an absurd amount of money is being spent on security, though it’s worth noting that <a type="internal">a recent audit showed</a> there were other financial problems within the UC system that go well beyond the money spent on protecting conservative speakers. In any case, I think most people on the right and left would agree this is not an ideal situation. The question is this: Why is so much spending necessary? And here, Hanlon completely whiffs on the answer:</p> <q> <p>Undoubtedly, left-wing “antifa” groups have contributed to the security risks and costs at Berkeley, taking the bait that speakers like Mr. Yiannopoulos lay out and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/berkeley-at-center-of-political-battleground-reverses-decision-to-cancel-speech-by-conservative-pundit-ann-coulter/2017/04/20/75574a72-25ef-11e7-b503-9d616bd5a305_story.html?utm_term=.78a7da6bfc17" type="external">battling</a> far-right militia groups who <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/04/25/new-alt-right-fight-club-ready-street-violence" type="external">show up looking for a fight</a>. But we should keep in mind, as the historian Mark Bray <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/08/16/who-are-the-antifa/?utm_term=.8c41842629f3" type="external">points out</a>, that antifa groups form specifically to counter white supremacist and Nazi violence, having done so from the days of Hitler and Mussolini. Antifa groups are a symptom, not a cause, of the threat of white supremacist violence.</p> </q> <p>To say that Antifa has “contributed” to costs at Berkeley could be the understatement of the year. When Antifa shut down a previous speech by Yiannopoulos in February members of the group beat several people and did <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/At-Berkeley-Yiannopoulos-protest-100-000-in-10905217.php" type="external">$100,000 in property damage</a>. That doesn’t include the damage done to the school’s reputation as the home of the free speech movement. And that’s a pittance compared to the <a type="internal">$1 million in damage</a> Antifa did in Portland this year. Political violence is costly.</p> <p>When Ben Shapiro came to Berkeley earlier this month, the school felt it necessary to <a type="internal">close the balcony</a> of the theater where he was speaking (lest Antifa kill someone), shut down 7 nearby buildings, set up concrete barriers and spend $600,000 to keep the event safe. As I pointed out <a type="internal">here</a>, local banks closed early and boarded up windows. Does Professor Hanlon think they were worried about zealous capitalists trying to withdraw too much money?</p> <p>The bland reference to “historian Mark Bray” suggests Hanlon isn’t being remotely honest with his audience. Bray isn’t just a historian – he’s a far left former Occupy spokesman who is now the single most prominent defender of Antifa’s violence in the public sphere. Maybe that’s worth mentioning when using him as an expert on Antifa.</p> <p>But the most offensive thing here is the idea that Antifa is merely a “symptom.” This is an attempt to get violent kooks off the hook for their own inexcusable behavior. Hanlon does this by bringing up the historical reaction to the Nazis. But do Nazis explain the surge of <a type="internal">Antifa violence</a> that took place in Germany this summer or, for that matter, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/19/politics/trump-inauguration-protests-womens-march/index.html" type="external">in Washington</a> in January? You almost get the impression Antifa doesn’t need much of an excuse to get violent.</p> <p>Getting back to Berkeley, the amount of money spent to keep speakers safe is a proportionate response to the threat of left-wing violence. How do we know? Because in its response to a lawsuit brought against the school by the college Republicans this is the exact argument <a type="internal">Berkeley made</a> [emphasis added]:</p> <q> <p>The email explained that UCPD had, based on a “comprehensive review of potential sites and security arrangements,” “determined that, given currently active security threats, it is not possible to assure that the event could be held successfully—or that the safety of Ms. Coulter, the event sponsors, audience, and bystanders could be adequately protected—at any of the campus venues available on April 27th.”…</p> <p>Plaintiffs contend that Defendants enforced the “unwritten, High-Profile Speaker Policy against YAF and BCR,” while allowing Vicente Fox Quesada, the former president of Mexico, to speak on campus at 4:00 p.m. on April 17, 2017, and Maria Echaveste to speak on campus from 6:45 to 8:00 p.m. “without incident or interference from Defendants.” (Id. ¶¶ 78-79, 91.) Plaintiffs do not allege any threats to security accompanying the speeches of Mr. Fox or Ms. Echaveste.</p> </q> <p>In other words, there weren’t any right-wing mobs looking to shut down or shout down left-wing speakers. There were credible threats (and recent history) of mob action by the left against right-wing speakers. This is what you call a clue! Professor Hanlon seems to have missed it.</p> <p>Finally, the suggestion that Hanlon makes that Ben Shapiro is somehow a representative of the threat of white supremacist violence is absurd. He is a Jewish conservative who has been a frequent (in fact, the most frequent) target of alt-right anger over the past year. And yet, there were credible threats he would be shut down if not for the extensive preparations by law enforcement.</p> <p>The cost of protecting conservative speakers on campus is far too high, while the cost of protecting progressive speakers is minimal. The solution to this problem is not to suggest schools should give up trying but to demand that the people making the threats stop making them. It’s a shame so many contributors to the NY Times can’t seem to get that.</p></article>

	<article id="0000980" published-at="2017-10-02" title="“Outraged Democrats” don’t even wait 8 hours before calling for more gun control"><p>Well, this was sadly predictable, even when the day started with a lot of people calling on their fellow citizens to not jump into politicizing the Las Vegas shooting while the injured were still being tended to. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/angry-democrats-demand-action-guns-after-las-vegas-shooting-n806561?cid=eml_nbn_20171002" type="external">NBC News is reporting</a> that some of the usual list of Democratic suspects have taken advantage of this tragedy to immediately call for new gun control laws.</p> <q> <p>The worst mass shooting in modern American history was met with immediate calls for action on gun control Monday from some Democratic lawmakers.</p> <p>While most of their colleagues on both sides of the aisle stuck to sending condolences to victims and their families in the Las Vegas shooting, Connecticut’s senators expressed outrage that Congress has not done more to restrict access to deadly firearms five years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown.</p> <p>“Nowhere but America do horrific large-scale mass shootings happen with this degree of regularity,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a statement.</p> <p>“This must stop,” Murphy continued. “It is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren’t public policy responses to this epidemic. There are, and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference. It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.”</p> </q> <p>Murphy was joined by his Connecticut partners, Senator Richard Blumenthal and Congressman Jim Himes. Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren quickly got in on the act as well.</p> <a type="internal"/> Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? <p>Okay, then. Fine. Since we apparently have to go through this exercise every time there’s a tragedy, let’s talk about it. Right out of the gate I would ask these Democrats the same questions we need to wrestle with after every shooting. First of all, what went wrong in this instance and what specific laws would you like to suggest which might have prevented it and will hopefully prevent something like this from happening again in the future?</p> <p>Thus far we don’t have much in the way of rock solid details as to what weapons the shooter used. Allahpundit laid out pretty much all the possibilities <a type="internal">in an earlier post</a> and the raw laws of physics dictated that it was going to wind up being one of those options or possibly a combination of a couple. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/las-vegas-suspect-likely-used-automatic-rifle-in-massacre-1506966716?mg=prod/accounts-wsj" type="external">More details are leaking out and it now</a> sounds as if there were, in fact, one or more fully automatic weapons along with a bunch of semiautomatics, but the police aren’t providing an exhaustive list. Let’s go on the assumption that we won’t know for sure for a while and move forward from there. The path leading us to how the shooter and the firearms wound up in that hotel room should be able to guide you in your answers for what sort of new gun control laws you’d like us to consider.</p> <p>Let’s say it’s the most obvious choice based on the sounds we heard in the many witness videos… one or more fully automatic machine guns of some sort. If that’s the case, the shooter either purchased it legally prior to 1986 or he obtained it illegally by stealing it or buying it on the black market. If the former, then he passed one of the most rigorous federal background checks imaginable and was already on the radar of the FBI just for owning the weapon or weapons. He was also pretty well off since they would have cost him upwards of $10K each. (Though he had two really nice cars, so maybe he could afford it.) That means that someone who passed those most brutal of background checks went off the rails, became insane or developed some other issues later in life. What law would you propose to prevent that?</p> <p>Perhaps he stole them or bought them on the black market. Then no amount of background checks in the world would have stopped this because people dealing in illegal weapons don’t do background checks.</p> <p>Perhaps, as Allahpundit speculated, he had a brace of ten or more AR-15 style semiautomatics which he modified. Well, modifying them in that fashion is illegal already. If you’d like to suggest tougher penalties for people who do that, I suppose I can get onboard with the idea, but somehow it doesn’t seem like it would have stopped this guy. If your solution is to once again ask to ban all of the millions of legal owners of semiautomatic rifles from owning them in response to someone who broke the law by modifying them you’re not solving a problem, you’re creating a bigger one.</p> <p>Beyond that what would you suggest? Smaller magazine capacities? (Nevada doesn’t have a very restrictive limit.) The guy had ten or more rifles lined up by the window. And anyone with a day or so of practice can swap out a magazine in under three seconds. You might have slowed him down a fraction, but not much.</p> <p>That’s all I’ve come up with. So, dear Outraged Democrats, let me know if you’ve thought of something else. If your plan is to simply repeal the Second Amendment, bring that fight on. But I do have one actual solution you never seem to want to talk about. If, as it’s not unreasonable to suspect, the shooter got his guns illegally, why don’t you consider new or enhanced laws and more resources to crack down on the illegal gun market? Rather than chasing around and harassing the hundreds of millions of legal gun owners who don’t commit acts of violence, unleash the power of the legislature and law enforcement on improved ways to get illegal guns off the streets and lock up the people using or dealing in them for longer periods of time.</p> <p>Gee… what a novel idea, eh?</p></article>
	<article id="0000981" published-at="2017-10-17" title="Justice Department jamming shut the revolving door for illegal aliens"><p>One of the running complaints raised against opponents of border security is the proliferation of criminal illegal aliens who enter the United States repeatedly, are apprehended and then sent back to their home countries. That part of the formula would be fine were it not for the fact that so many of them keep crossing the border multiple times, only to be found committing additional crimes. In some of the worst cases, you wind up with a result along the lines of the murder of Kate Steinle. But less high profile situations clog the system on a regular basis.</p> <p>This year that destructive pattern has finally begun to change, albeit slowly. With new laws on the books and a more aggressive Attorney General, prosecutions are on the rise and sentences are at least somewhat more appropriate for the perpetrators. One such case came through this week in Louisiana, where Juan Carlos Rigoberto-Martinez had been caught in the country illegally multiple times after committing multiple crimes. The citizen of Honduras encountered a different sort of reception this time and found himself in federal court where he was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdla/pr/aggravated-felon-illegally-united-states-sentenced-more-10-years-federal-prison" type="external">summarily sent up the river for more than a decade</a>. (Justice.gov)</p> <a type="internal"/> Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? <q> <p>BATON ROUGE, LA – Acting United States Attorney Corey Amundson announced that yesterday U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles sentenced JUAN CARLOS RIGOBERTO-MARTINEZ, age 33, of Honduras, to serve 130 months in federal prison for illegally reentering the United States after removal. The defendant’s extensive criminal history, including his status as an aggravated felon, contributed significantly to the lengthy sentence.</p> <p>Yesterday’s sentence stems from the defendant’s federal conviction on April 12, 2017, for illegally reentering the United States after removal. Immigration authorities first removed the defendant from the United States on January 7, 2008, after he completed a state prison sentence in Georgia for burglary and theft.</p> <p>Several months later, on June 5, 2008, the U.S. Border Patrol found and arrested the defendant in Texas for illegally reentering the United States after removal. The defendant plead guilty to the offense, resulting in a 77-month federal prison sentence from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. On December 27, 2013, immigration authorities again removed the defendant from the United States following the completion of his prison term.</p> </q> <p>This is an encouraging development which will hopefully send a strong message to the illegal alien community. Too often in the past we’ve seen illegals who have been deported as many as seven times being brought in on charges and we essentially focus on the new crimes they have committed. If those are sufficiently “minor” in nature they are frequently given yet another free ride back to their homeland and the cycle begins anew.</p> <p>Not so with Rigoberto-Martinez. He had done a short stretch in prison in Georgia for burglary in 2008 when he was deported back to Honduras. In a matter of months he was back in the United States illegally once again. This time he was arrested for multiple robberies in Baton Rouge. He was already found guilty on those counts, but this time there was a difference. In a separate trial, he was found guilty exclusively of reentering the country illegally after having been deported as a criminal illegal alien. That was the charge he was sent up on rather than the robberies. (For which he will serve a shorter, concurrent sentence.)</p> <p>Even if all Rigoberto-Martinez had been convicted of was petty theft of a pack of gum at a convenience store, he could have been locked away for a good, long stretch for illegal reentry. It’s obvious that our prison system doesn’t need to be further strained with a deluge of these criminals, but the less welcoming of a place we make America for criminal illegal aliens, the lower the incentive will be to jump the fence and come here. The sentencing of Rigoberto-Martinez goes at least some way towards driving that message home among the illegal alien community.</p> <p>Now if we can just make the E-Verify system mandatory across the board to decrease the incentive for illegal aliens looking to take paying jobs rather than stick-up jobs we might really have something going. But don’t get your hopes up, since that would involve Congress actually doing their jobs.</p></article>

For some lefties, a constitutional deus ex machina in which the queen is magically restored to her rightful throne is it.</p> <a type="internal"/> Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? <p>The law prof behind this, <a href="https://medium.com/@lessig/on-what-should-happen-if-the-unthinkable-happens-b6915cbc543d" type="external">Lawrence Lessig</a>, also claimed last December that <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/donald-trump-electors-lessig-232598" type="external">20 Republican members of the electoral college</a> were considering voting against Trump. In the end, Trump lost two. Hillary Clinton lost more Democratic electors than that. And now here we are. As summarized by <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/hillary-clinton-president-lawrence-lessig-post-686077" type="external">Newsweek</a>:</p> <q> <p>If number 1: If Trump is definitively found to have colluded directly with Russia, he would be forced to resign or be impeached.</p> <p>If number 2: If Trump is removed, Vice President Mike Pence would become president.</p> <p>If number 3: If Pence becomes president, he should resign too, given that he benefited from the same help from Mother Russia.</p> <p>If number 4: If Pence resigns before appointing a vice president, Ryan would become president.</p> <p>If number 5: If Ryan becomes president, he should do the right thing and choose Clinton for vice president. Then he should resign.</p> </q> <p>Actually, there’s a sixth step in Lessig’s piece: In a gesture of goodwill, President Hillary should then appoint Ryan (or some other Republican) as her VP. Imagine the Clinton/Ryan ticket trying to work through disagreements on, say, entitlements and federal spending.</p> <p>Jay Cost made a good point about this last night. Even if you’ve convinced yourself that there’s a chance in hell of Trump *and* Pence both being removed by the Senate due to collusion with Russia, why would you seize on some convoluted “Ryan names Hillary VP and then resigns” fantasy to get her into the Oval Office? There’s a much more straightforward way:</p> <p>Step one: Democrats win back the House, which isn’t at all unlikely right now.</p> <p>Step two: Democrats name Hillary Clinton the new Speaker. Pelosi won’t like that, but whatever. The Speaker doesn’t need to be a member of the House.</p> <p>Step three: The House impeaches Trump and Pence.</p> <p>Step four: The Senate removes Trump and Pence, clearing the way for — ta da — Speaker Clinton to become president via established rules of succession.</p> <p>That fourth step’s a doozy, though, huh? Due to the fact that the most vulnerable senators up for reelection next fall are almost all Democrats, even the most optimistic Dems think the best-case scenario in the midterms is winning a *bare* majority in the Senate. That would require holding all vulnerable Democratic seats, knocking off Dean Heller and Jeff Flake, and then pulling a major red-state upset somewhere. Do all that — an inside straight electorally — and you’ve got 51. In which case Schumer would still need no fewer than 16 Republicans to vote for removing Trump (and Pence). Unless Mueller produces video of Putin handing Trump a fat envelope, he’ll never get it. And even then, half the party would argue that we can’t know exactly what was in the envelope. Maybe it was a Hallmark card offering the United States a reset.</p> <p>I have no big ending to this post, so in lieu of an exit question, enjoy Rand Paul dumping all over John McCain and Lindsey Graham.</p> <q> <p>Senator <a href="https://twitter.com/RandPaul?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">@RandPaul</a>: "People like McCain and Graham, who parade as conservatives but are not really conservative, they need to be called out." <a href="https://t.co/ivVvjIUwJ9" type="external">pic.twitter.com/ivVvjIUwJ9</a></p> <p>— CSPAN (@cspan) <a href="https://twitter.com/cspan/status/920388190611165189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">October 17, 2017</a></p> </q></article>
	<article id="0000983" published-at="2017-07-30" title="Made in America: Buy or Not to Buy?">
Ask about your products, become more involved. <p>Are you ok with supporting sweatshop labor?</p> <p>Are you ok with knowing your cheaper product made somewhere else could be causing suffering to another family?</p> <p>Are we killing our jobs, economy, and business?</p> Importing from Another Country or Buying the Material In American? <p>Over my lifetime, I have continually heard my family and friends complain "everything is made in China." In many ways, until I started working and understood just how some businesses work, I had no clue about how imports could undercut prices in this country. Most everyone usually has a problem with this concept; China manufacturers in massive numbers whereas, America produces only smaller and more accurate parts and products. Furthermore, the mass production allows for decreased prices.</p> <p>Think of every single product you have purchased in the last few months, look at the back or wherever the label is and find the origin. Chances are, your parts and products have not been manufactured in the same country. Instead, a variety of supplies will be imported from different locations then shipped into a plant to finish production. For example, the new administration put forth "buy American, hire American" to help existing businesses and start up businesses produce and distribute these within their local and even national community.</p> <p>Many times, even products and parts claiming to be made in America have been found to be nothing but a fraud, they purchase the steel, ingredients, etc. in America but then, ship these things to another country to be put together or made and then sent back to this country. For example, I use to work for Highland Industries, Inc in Kernersville, NC a few years back, they manufactured the raw rubber for Nascar, GM, Ford, Nissan and so on as well as the seat belt division located in another state.</p> <p>I drove a forklift and kept an inventory duel role. We made the rubber at the plant, hired a trucking company to come from Laredo, Texas to drive all the way to NC to pick up a load and then drive back and enter Mexico to get the rubber put on the tires as well as the seat belt material was cut and sewn. This material was then shipped back to the states to be sold to the auto industry/parts to them or to the customers.</p> Digging a Little Deeper <p>Now, we must consider what brings up the current "buy American" has lost its value since NAFTA took effect; manufacturing virtually went away during this unfair exchange of labor and allowing basically slave labor/sweatshops to cut jobs primarily hurting everyone in the process. Why does it hurt cheaper labor/sweatshops? Consider the situation. While we may receive lower prices overall and the business usually makes a significant profit, the ones doing the work are not getting a fair wage and often are put in adverse working conditions and extremely long working hours.</p> <p>So, it must be better actually to buy American right? The answer may surprise you. Currently, my wife and I own a small business making whole body products such as soaps, shampoos, laundry detergent, etc.mostly, our products are mostly made in America.</p> <p>What does that necessarily equate to? Here's the answer, we purchase our bases, the blocks of material that we cut off smaller portions, weigh them, melt it and put it into a pour spout cup, mix up the fragrances and put them into 8, 16, 32 oz bottles of shampoo, deodorant bottles or soap molds. We can purchase the bases from other American owned companies cheaper here, the fragrances here, most shipping supplies but believe it or not, Ali Express in China can produce better and more inexpensive bottles, lids and some other products because, in America, these items are generally one to two dollars more expensive.</p> <p>These companies once they are called and asked where they are getting their bulk supplies usually tell you they get them overseas and usually end the conversation. In most of my phone calls initially, when the company started up, most of these wholesalers told me they got them from Ali Express. This usually ends up cutting out the "middle man" as it were and if you are a business, you can contact this company and purchase directly and save a lot of money.</p> Do People Practice What They Preach? <p>Often we now hear about buying local, I have found out that many of these same people that make a claim, will not buy local but will rather go online and purchase from Amazon or some major retailer for a lower price and even pay more for shipping than driving to the brick and mortar store. As a small business owner, I can fully understand the need to save money and do other things with it, but at the same time, our country cannot continue to keep on with the mentality that our products are worth a lot more than they are. American's can and should make our parts and products again to bring down prices, the only reason things cost more money for our country and businesses is that companies pay out larger portions of labor fees to their employees.</p> <p>The mentality that we all must have a 15 dollar and an hour wage will drive prices through the roof and put these same people demanding the pay out of work or cut down considerably. We must, as a country, require our manufacturing start producing and take back the products that are currently being made in China but people demand low prices on every product regardless of what the part or product is. This mentality coupled with the "entitled" generation will cause great problems in these areas, children growing up think they have the right to an education, excellent wages for minimum skills and countless other things. They are being told that we shouldn't be making our products and mock most people doing things for themselves such as the business that my wife and I produce in our spare time.</p> <p>I cannot stand the fact that I must purchase from China on my product bottles, deodorant, and even chapstick tubes to save money and hopefully start employing people. If another company in America would produce the same products at the same price or barely a little more expensive, I would switch. Still, to continue having a competitive edge, something has to give.</p> <p>Maybe I have given others something to think about but just remember, before NAFTA was put in place, we produced most of our furniture but sadly has dwindled to almost nothing now. My mother worked at the Basset Furniture in Mt. Airy, NC for nearly 20 years putting in runners in drawers before things started going away. To continue surviving in our country again, we must all demand and purchase actually companies that are mostly/are made in America to bring back our economy and support ourselves/friends.</p> <p>This may sound a little political, but it’s the truth, you cannot demand to buy local when you don't actually buy local, to begin with, and demand the company lose money to sell it to you cheaper. My advice, find America owned companies, ask them if they make their products here, and should they confirm this, remember just because it's more reasonable from somewhere else does not mean it is made well. Quantity and quality are two different spheres. Some products such as the Apple iPhone and others are manufactured in another country produced by sweatshop workers that live in dangerous working conditions and terrible wages.It's time to start thinking more about the product and what it supports than that lower price, did you know that</p> Appreciate the Importance of Cruelty Free <p>Another important aspect to consider when delving into the shopping and purchasing products involves the meaning of "Cruelty-Free." For many years, America prohibited the practices of animal testing. In fact, many believe this to be a standard in American production and manufacturing still. What few realize is the time limit placed on animal experiments has expired. Now, many companies, especially within the makeup industry, have once again returned to this horrible practice. For example:</p> Avon. Benefit.Clinique. CoverGirl.Estée Lauder. L'Oréal. Makeup Forever, and Maybelline. <p>Do all test their products on animals? Please look up these companies and do more than getting angry about it or if you don't know, then you need to, buying these products don't help Americans and kill, and injured animals every year.</p> <p>The challenge is recognizing how we all either can support and begin to make personal changes to impact the direction of the safety of our products. It also reminds us to identify the need to accept responsibility by how our decisions may affect not only others but also animals as well. Move forward with purpose!</p> Learn to Ask Questions <p>Call companies and ask where they get their ingredients/parts from</p> <p>Ask do they make the product/food whatever in America</p> <p>Look around locally and inspect whatever you purchase for origins</p> <p>Questions are not bad!

	<article id="0000984" published-at="2017-08-15" title="Tooth Regeneration Must Prevail!">
A. Introduction <p>Science and technology are both evolving rapidly. Often they are both evolving so rapidly that even the savviest people have a difficult time keeping abreast of all the latest developments in each area of science and technology. Not too long ago, my sister had a conversation with me about computer technology, and she made the point that a computer that you buy from a store becomes obsolete by the time that you remove it from its box and get it running. Nevertheless, certain items continue to remain in existence despite that one would think that they would be obsolete by now, and usually it is because of popular demand. Take the example of the manual typewriter. Authors all have their own preferences on how they wish to compose their literary works. When I was watching the movie titled The Magic of Belle Isle in which Morgan Freeman played the role of an author, there was a scene in that movie in which he stressed that he preferred a manual typewriter because of the feeling that he got from using it. He added that he also liked the sound of it. Interestingly enough, nobody ever has to go on a wild goose chase to find a replacement part for a typewriter, manual or electric, whenever it is on the fritz and they have to take it somewhere to get it fixed. On the other hand, authors who use computers are always confronted with the dreaded fate of their computer running into software and hardware problems after replacement parts that they later need for it have stopped being manufactured. Certain photographers will stress that pictures just don’t look natural unless they are taken with a camera that uses real film rather than digital technology.</p> <p>I remember back in the 1990s right after I had been in the Northridge earthquake out in California, I became concerned about whether my records had been damaged. However, when I asked all my relatives nearby if I could use their record players to check them for scratches, they told me that they were out of order and that they didn’t know where I could buy one either. Unfortunately, I did not own a record player at the time. When I had initially bought these records, I had used my parents’ record player to play them. However, because my parents were living clear back on the East Coast, I no longer had that option after I had moved out to California. Anyhow, I phoned just about every store in West Los Angeles and Santa Monica that I could think of to ask whether they sold record players, and they all told me that they no longer did so inasmuch as everyone was buying CDs by then and almost nobody was selling regular vinyl records. Ironically, not too many years later, record players began appearing in sales magazines that I received in the mail, and eventually regular stores began selling them again because of the popular demand for them. Then, shortly thereafter, vinyl records began making a comeback to the market. By the way, I eventually checked my records for scratches after I was eventually able to buy a record player of my own that allowed me to listen to them, and it turned out that the earthquake had not damaged them in any manner.</p> <p>Manual typewriters, regular camera film, vinyl records, and record players all four have become such a regular part of American pop culture that not even the rapid evolution of science and technology will ever completely phase them out. Americans have grown too attached to these items, because they have a certain charm about them. On the other hand, whenever anyone hears the mention of dentures or any kind of prosthetic teeth, angry faces appear everywhere. The fact of the matter is that most people hate the idea of having such phony baloney materials in their mouth at all times. Most people feel that dentures and false teeth are completely below them, because they are unattractive and they are often associated with getting old. Then again, most elderly individuals would prefer to have their own natural teeth than a mouth full of false teeth.</p> <p>Dentures and false teeth are just not really anybody’s cup of tea. They’re expensive, and they’re a pain in the neck to have in your mouth. Dental implants may seem closer in appearance to natural teeth, but they are still expensive and they involve a certain degree of unwanted risks. Fillings, crowns, caps, and bridges may not get as many dirty looks from the public at large, but the high costs of having them placed in your mouth still makes them not so popular. Then many of us ask ourselves why do these abominations of dentistry continue to exist if computer technology is evolving too rapidly for people to keep up with it. Shouldn’t dental technology be evolving just as quickly as computer technology?</p> <p>The Microsoft Corporation had the Windows 8 system on the market for a very short time inasmuch as the Windows 10 system was invented shortly after the Windows 8 system became publicly available. One would think that if computer technology evolves that quickly, even dental floss would have been phased out years ago and we would now be using some kind of small, handheld rod with some kind of sterilization light at the end of it to eliminate plaque from in between our teeth. When you think about it, floss has to be the most primitive item in existence. The irony of it is that dentists will scream their heads off at their patients on how they must use floss or all their teeth are going to fall out. However, I did not begin using dental floss until I was 10 years old, and all my teeth had not fallen out by then, excluding any of my baby teeth. In fact, I don’t remember getting any cavities the year before then. Therefore, it is apparent that the benefits of flossing are so overrated. And please don’t say that I was lucky. I hate that word “lucky,” because it is so unrealistic. It gives me the image in my mind of someone with a ridiculously big grin on their face saying “You’re so lucky!” in a voice that sounds similar to that of Barney the Purple Dinosaur or some cartoon character. Moreover, I have never been lucky at anything throughout my life. I’ve had to work hard for everything that I’ve gotten throughout my life, and I’ve gone up against many odds along the way. In my world, being lucky is an optical illusion altogether. Anyhow, if you don’t believe my point about dental floss, watch the YouTube video below and it will tell you how certain experts agree that using dental floss is virtually futile to oral hygiene. What is interesting about this same video is that one of the experts states that if you use mouthwash, you don’t need to use dental floss. After watching this same video, you won’t feel subconscious about not flossing at night once in a while whenever you’re so tired that you just want to go straight to bed rather than mess with string, which is what dental floss is.</p> <p>Two years ago when I was temping at a call center and my co-workers and I were in what is called downtime, which is when telephone calls don’t come into a call center for a long period of time, I got into a conversation with a co-worker of mine named India about dental care. During our conversation, I brought up the topic of tooth regeneration. However, despite how intelligent and savvy India was about many things, she told me that she had never heard of tooth regeneration before. I then explained to her exactly what it was. She then asked me whether it was the same thing as dental implants, and I told her that it wasn’t inasmuch as dental implants were still prosthetic teeth whereas tooth regeneration mainly involved the transplant of natural teeth. She then smiled at me and told me that she thought that such a dental procedure seemed like an excellent idea inasmuch as people would prefer to have something real in their mouth rather than something fake. It made me think of that 1968 song by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell titled “Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing.”</p> B. A Description Of Tooth Regeneration And How It All Works <p>There are basically two different types of tooth regeneration that scientists are attempting to make available to the general public through the dental profession. The first type of <a href="https://www.bryantconsultants.com/general/future-dentistry-means-patient" type="external">tooth regeneration</a> involves the use of an electrical current to remineralize areas of tooth decay. That is, instead of someone going to their dentist to have a decayed section of their tooth cut away and then replaced with a filling, this dental procedure would allow for their dentist to arrest the decay in their tooth and it would also allow for the previously decayed area of the tooth to restore itself back to normal. The YouTube video below provides a description of this same procedure.</p> <p>The second type of tooth regeneration actually involves growing back a tooth to replace one that has been removed or lost. This procedure entails transplanting some kind of pod into the gums where a tooth is missing and then using stem cells to grow a replacement tooth. Down below are two YouTube videos that describe this same procedure.</p> <p><a href="http://www.rexresearch.com/maoteeth/maoteeth.html" type="external">Both of these tooth regeneration procedures are involving</a>, but they are also very worthwhile. Dr. Jeremy Mao, D.D.S., Ph.D. has already submitted an application on behalf of Columbia University to obtain a <a href="http://innovation.columbia.edu/technologies/2553_generation-of-tooth-structures-in-rats" type="external">patent</a> for these same procedures. Scientists have studied <a href="http://fillebeg1.rssing.com/browser.php?indx=2885899&amp;item=586" type="external">alligator teeth</a> to find out how to make these same procedures possible. Some people may not think that dentists being able to perform either tooth regeneration procedure is as important as scientists finding a permanent cure for AIDS; but because our oral health ties into many other characteristics of our overall health, both tooth regeneration procedures are going to make the world a healthier place to live in.</p> <p>Both of the above-described tooth regeneration procedures present themselves as the public’s deliverance from the dreaded indignities of prosthetic teeth. However, there is one problem. Neither of these procedures is yet available to the public. People are currently spending a fortune on fillings, caps, bridges, crowns, dentures, and even dental implants, and it seems that the light at the end of this dreary tunnel of primitive dentistry looks dimmer than most of us may have expected. However, whenever you research tooth regeneration on the Internet, you will notice that scientists have been working fiercely to perfect this dental phenomenon for years, even over the course of the last two decades. I even recall having listened to a car radio twenty years ago and having heard a report on the news that a group of scientists had grown a natural tooth in a laboratory. I remember getting particularly furious when I read an article on the Internet about tooth regeneration back in 2002, and the person who wrote the article had the audacity to say that she didn’t believe that tooth regeneration would become available to the public through the dental profession for another twenty years; and then she had the nerve to preach about how one, therefore, needed to floss their teeth every morning and every night. If I were able to remember the name of that person who wrote that article, I would e-mail her a link to the previously cited YouTube video about the futility of flossing teeth so that she would have the platinum opportunity to eat her own words. Pardon the pun.</p> <p>People like me who absolutely hate to floss their teeth because of the time and effort involved in it are always interested in knowing the exact date that dentists will begin performing both tooth regeneration procedures on their patients. I even saw a video on YouTube about the future in which the narrator mentioned that tooth regeneration would most likely be available to the public by 2022. However, experts have spoken in different documentaries and news clips as though tooth regeneration could become available to the public any day now. Therefore, here is the question. What is holding up the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures? Here in the second decade of the twenty-first century, fillings, crowns, caps, bridges, dentures, abutments, and dental implants all belong inside a glass-enclosed exhibit in a downtown museum rather than in people’s mouths.</p> <p>Once you have read the articles to which I have provided you with links herein, you immediately realize that scientists have various hurdles to jump over in making both tooth regeneration procedures available in dental offices throughout the world. It appears that the scientists, including Dr. Mao, who have taken every step to perfect both tooth regeneration procedures and make them safe to perform on humans have done just about everything they can do to make this scientific breakthrough available to everyone. However, there is still this one agency called the United States Food and Drug Administration (“F.D.A.”), and there is obviously other bureaucratic red tape that they have to contend with before both tooth regeneration procedures finally put the dental prosthetics industry out of business once and for all. This is where the politics kick in.</p> <p>Both tooth regeneration procedures do not involve the use of embryonic stem cells. Therefore, I would have to say that it is safe for me to deduce that Dr. Mao and his colleagues will not get any flak from the Religious Right during their proceedings to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the public at large. Because many evangelicals live in parts of our country where people consume great amounts of Mountain Dew and lose their teeth regularly as a result, I can be fairly sure that even they will welcome both tooth regeneration procedures to the dental profession. However, I don’t think that I can quite say the same thing about the dental prosthetics industry. These people are dead set on protecting their profits and ensuring their sales revenues at whatever cost to the public.</p> C. The Corporate Obstacles That Are Delaying The Public Availability Of Tooth Regeneration <p>When I was just a little kid, I remember this one news report that I saw on television regarding the milk industry. A group of scientists back then had invented some kind of synthetic milk that was less expensive and supposedly just as healthy as real milk. They planned on using it to make ice cream. There was even a little boy in the news report who sampled the ice cream containing the synthetic milk, and he said that he liked it. When I saw this news story, I was not very happy about it inasmuch as I did not like the idea of synthetic foods and beverages eventually replacing natural foods and beverages. Fortunately, the milk industry ran interference against the owner of this product and eventually kept it from ever seeing the light of day on the market. I was happy about it, and so were many other people inasmuch as very few people obviously liked the idea of putting fake stuff in their body. The milk industry did an important favor for the public at large, because such a synthetic product would have likely marked the beginning of both synthetic and genetically modified foods and beverages ( <a href="http://enhs.umn.edu/current/5103/gm/harmful.html" type="external">GMOs</a>) being placed on the market in large numbers, which, unfortunately, is happening today. In my mind and in the minds of many others, the milk industry had gone up to bat for the public interests. However, truth has it that the milk industry could have just as easily been only defending their own corporate interests, because if the synthetic milk had been released to the market to be used to make ice cream, the milk industry would have suffered serious losses in sales of their own products. After all, the milk industry has always depended greatly on their business relationships with ice cream companies to generate sales revenues for themselves. Of course, the milk industry probably also saw it in their own best interests to let the public go on believing that they had everyone’s best interests at heart when they ran interference against the owner of the synthetic milk product so that they would look like the heroes who protected the masses from the evil clutches of a mad scientist.</p> <p>This news story regarding synthetic milk and the milk industry’s intervention into the prospect of the synthetic milk’s entry into the market to make ice cream was not the first time that I had seen a news story like this one on television or had heard about events like these. Shortly after I had moved to New York City to work in a public sector position, my landlord, Mrs. Palladino, had a telephone conversation with me about insomnia. In that telephone conversation, she told me that she had read a magazine article back in the 1970s that revealed that a sleeping machine had been invented and that this sleeping machine helped people fall asleep quickly and safely. She explained to me that when the pharmaceutical industry got wind of it and realized how detrimental this sleeping machine would be to their sales of sedatives and tranquilizers if it were ever to get on the market, they zeroed in on the situation and purchased the patent to that sleeping machine so that they could stop it from being placed on the market. After Mrs. Palladino told me about this magazine article, I was extremely appalled by it; and I told her that it was not right for these pharmaceutical companies to do something like that inasmuch as sedatives and tranquilizers can be addictive and harmful to people after their prolonged consumption and the sleeping machine would have given people suffering from insomnia a healthy alternative to ingesting chemicals. Mrs. Palladino then explained to me that the only concern that the pharmaceutical companies had in this whole situation was their sales revenues. According to her, they couldn’t have cared less about the rights and the welfare of the consumer.</p> <p>What immediately comes to mind is a similar conversation between a friend and me that I described in my previous Hub titled “ <a href="https://soapboxie.com/social-issues/SECULAR-MEDICINE-SAVES-LIVES" type="external">Secular Medicine Saves Lives</a>.” That is, therein I stated that I had told a friend about a permanent cure for allergies that reportedly existed in the People’s Republic of China, and she responded to me that such a permanent cure would likely never be marketed here in the United States of America inasmuch as too many very rich moguls who owned the companies that manufactured antihistamines and other allergy-related medications would stand in its way in order to prevent such a medical breakthrough from jeopardizing their profits and sales revenues. Therefore, it is plain to see that greedy corporate moguls seldom have the public’s best interests at heart here in the land of milk and honey.</p> <p>When I saw the actor Mark Ruffalo appear on an edition of the HBO series Real Time With Bill Maher not too long ago, Mr. Ruffalo stressed to Bill Maher that this reprehensible kind of conduct among corporate moguls was quite common. Now, I have nothing against the free enterprise system, and I am all for the rule of laissez-faire whenever anyone wishes to conduct business here in the United States of America so long as they do not break the law. After all, our country was built on capitalism. However, whenever greedy corporate shysters collectively strive to obstruct the advancement of any kind of science or technology, including dental technology, this is where I feel that either the Federal government or the public at large or both needs to do damage control. In figurative words, no greedy corporate shyster has the right to fly his wife first class to France simply for her to get her hair done at an exclusive beauty salon in Paris at the expense and detriment of everyday people’s health and well-being.</p> <p>The dental prosthetics market, which includes the sales of dental implants, crowns, bridges, caps, fillings, dentures, and abutments, is <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/09/20/873110/0/en/Dental-Prosthetics-Market-to-Rise-up-to-US-5-8-bn-by-2023-Driven-by-Increasing-Geriatric-Population-Globally-TMR.html" type="external">a multimillion-dollar industry</a>. Anyone who has ever been to the dentist for anything more than just a regular checkup should know that getting a crown or even a filling is not cheap. Getting dentures and even dental implants cannot only be expensive but also a nightmare for anyone who has never been down that road before. Greedy corporate shysters are everywhere in the United States of America, and the dental prosthetics industry is no exception to that rule. Right at this very moment somewhere in our country, there is likely a greedy corporate shyster sitting at his desk and smoking a cigar either in his study den at home or in his office, and he is thinking about what he is going to do next to stop decent individuals in the scientific community like Dr. Mao from ever making both tooth regeneration procedures available to the dental profession so that everyone can have access to it. Perhaps there may not be news stories popping up everywhere on the Internet or over the television and radio airwaves about the dental prosthetics industry engaging in this reprehensible kind of conduct. However, if you research the pattern of conduct that corporations have engaged in over the past four decades, you will find an astronomical number of reasons to suspect the dental prosthetics industry of engaging in this reprehensible type of conduct.</p> <p>Whether or not anyone can actually prove that this reprehensible type of conduct is going on in the dental prosthetics industry, we still must presume the worst and take action on it inasmuch as it could make a difference between both tooth regeneration procedures being available to the public next year or not being available to the public until the next century. The corporate moguls who own, operate, and profit from the dental prosthetics industry are likely well aware that once both tooth regeneration procedures become fully available to the entire world, the demand for their products is going to plummet rapidly. Never mind any reports or news stories that you see on the Internet about this same industry prospering into a multibillion-dollar industry by 2021. Owners of video stores back in the early part of the twenty-first century all probably thought that they would be living in some plush mansion out in Santa Barbara, California by now, but we all know what happened to that industry after more sophisticated forms of television technology came along such as the DVR and Video-On-Demand. Netflix, Amazon Prime, and even YouTube did not help their situation either after these same three entities came into existence.</p> <p>At first, people are going to be able to get outrageously good deals on dental implants and other prosthetic dental materials (e.g. fillings, caps, crowns, bridges, and dentures) after both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the public at large. Extensive dental work involving these items will likely become more affordable than it has ever been in the history of our nation. It will have to do so, because the dental prosthetics industry will be standing on its last legs financially by then. The amount of unemployment and underemployment in our nation will maintain a market for this industry, because these prosthetic dental materials will become so cheap that this industry will be desperate to sell them in one way or another; and consumers with limited incomes will be the only ones buying them at that point in time. Of course, if the problem with joblessness in our country diminishes significantly in the near future, then the demand for these bargain prosthetic dental materials will decrease drastically. It’s kind of like the situation back in the late 1980s and the early 1990s in which once CDs became common, record stores began giving outrageously exceptional deals on regular vinyl records inasmuch as fewer people were buying them. Of course, regular vinyl records eventually made a comeback to the market because of their sentimental nature. However, there is nothing sentimental about dentures, false teeth, and prosthetic dental items, and the sales backlash that the dental prosthetics industry will initially experience subsequent to the public availability of tooth regeneration will not last forever. Therefore, once both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the public at large, profits and sales revenues for the companies that manufacture prosthetic dental materials will never be the same again; and eventually this same industry is going to collapse and disappear forever.</p> <p>Some of you may be questioning how the dental insurance industry is going to respond to the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures. My guess is about as good as yours. It really depends on how expensive such procedures will be. If these two procedures are less expensive than having prosthetic dental materials placed in dental patients’ mouths, then the dental insurance industry will likely see it as more cost-effective for them to insure both tooth regeneration procedures and discontinue insuring any prosthetic-related dental procedures. If the dental insurance industry decides to go down that road, then their actions will further speed up the eventual collapse of the dental prosthetics industry altogether. On the other hand, if dental prosthetics companies immediately begin offering bargain prices on their products, the dental insurance industry may cut them some slack. At least for a while, that is. Unless I could somehow get a hold of what the cost factor would be, I cannot really speculate how the dental insurance industry is going to respond to the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures. However, I can say that if the owners of these dental insurance companies are conscientious about the oral health of their customers, then they could possibly feel more inclined to grant coverage for both tooth regeneration procedures and then eventually deny coverage for any prosthetic-related dental procedure altogether from that point on.</p> <p>Nevertheless, let’s not get excited just yet about the prospective extinction of dental implants, dentures, and the likes. Greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry are going to run interference any way they can against Dr. Mao and his colleagues from making both tooth regeneration procedures a complete reality for everyone. They will see opportunities to do so in the form of finding creative ways to get the F.D.A. to deny Dr. Mao and his colleagues the approval they need from that Federal government agency to release both tooth regeneration procedures to the dental market. Greedy corporate shysters will pay lawyers exorbitant quantities of money to bring legal actions against Dr. Mao and his colleagues and to contact whatever government agencies they need to do so in order to throw legal roadblocks at Dr. Mao and his colleagues from ever being able to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the dental profession and the public at large. These are the kinds of disgraceful tactics that greedy corporate shysters use to protect their own profits and sales revenues at the expense and detriment of others. These injustices have happened in the past; and they will continue to happen, unless public officials and consumers collectively stop them in their tracks.</p> D. A Solution That Would Speed Up The Public Availability Of Tooth Regeneration <p>Instead of just sitting back and complaining about what the dental prosthetics industry most likely is doing to delay and even obstruct the availability of both tooth regeneration procedures here in the United States of America, I believe that the best course of action is for all of us to do something about it. The question is, “What can we do?” These greedy corporate shysters have so much money that it is not going to be easy for any of us to undermine their efforts to deprive the world of both tooth regeneration procedures. Some of you may be thinking about writing letters to your elected officials for that matter. My response to your course of action is that it can’t hurt. However, I believe that there really is only one truly effective course of action that the public can take to stop these greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry from getting in the way of both tooth regeneration procedures becoming available to the public someday in the near future.</p> <p>People have large quantities of money invested in stocks that fund these companies that manufacture prosthetic dental materials. Many of you out there who are reading this Hub may be one of those investors. Therefore, any of you who have money invested in these companies need to sell those stocks now and pull your money out of these companies while you can. In other words, as the saying goes, if you take away the food, the cockroaches starve and eventually die. In this case, the greedy corporate shysters who own these dental prosthetics companies are the cockroaches that need to be financially starved out of business. To all of you out there who may have money invested in these companies, I am well aware that your money is your money and that you are free to do with it as you please. However, if you cannot sell your stocks and pull your money investments out of these companies for the sake of the public interests, then do it for yourself.</p> <p>Whether you like it or not, the dental prosthetics industry is going to collapse sooner or later. These greedy corporate shysters can buy themselves more time to extend their lavish lifestyles at the expense and detriment of others, but their dental prosthetics empires are not going to last forever. Once both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the general public, your stocks are going to plummet so quickly in value that you will not know what hit you; and you just don’t want to be caught up in that rapid loss of money that investors who still have their money tied up in stocks with these companies will suffer. Moreover, these greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry don’t care about anybody but themselves, and they are simply not worth it. This is something that affects everyone of every socioeconomic structure, because most everybody would prefer to have a natural set of teeth rather than have a mouth full of crowns, dental implants, and other prosthetic dental materials.</p> E. My Conclusion Regarding The Future Of Tooth Regeneration <p>The greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry may not make themselves or their reprehensible actions readily obvious to the public at large, but you only have to be aware of the unusual delay of both tooth regeneration procedures becoming publicly available to know that it is more likely than not that these same greedy corporate shysters are doing everything that they can to stand between the public and tooth regeneration. The dental prosthetics industry has long outlived its purpose here in the United States of America, and it is time to put these jokers out of business once and for all to clear the pathway for new and improved dental technology in the form of tooth regeneration. If investors pull their money out of these self-serving companies and sell their stocks, these companies will eventually weaken and lose their financial ability to interfere with the efforts of Dr. Mao and others like him to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the world. If these companies’ monetary assets begin to dry up, they will be spending so much of their financial resources in trying to keep themselves afloat that they won’t have the time or the economic stamina to throw political roadblocks at Dr. Mao and others like him. All of us could have a healthy mouth of pearly whites if we just work together to make it happen. Here in the second decade of the twenty-first century, dental implants, false teeth, dentures, fillings, crowns, bridges, caps, and abutments all belong in a glass-enclosed exhibit in a downtown museum rather than in anyone’s mouth.</p></article>

The tip was forwarded to the San Diego Internet Crimes Against Children task force, which obtained a search warrant and probed further into the user's emails and online chats.</p> <p>The search, according to the criminal complaint filed by the FBI, turned up, among other images, one of a prepubescent girl naked from the waist down with her legs spread wide apart, engaged in "sexually explicit conduct." <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/354892771/Raymond-Liddy-Criminal-Complaint#from_embed" type="external">[FBI Complaint]</a></p> <p>The arrest takes place as a separate investigation in California has resulted in the busting of one of the largest human trafficking networks on the West Coast, by the Tulare County Sheriff’s Department, Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking Task Force, and the California Department of Justice.

Investigators found that traffickers used high-end sports cars, such as a 2017 Maserati Ghibli, a 2017 Maserati Levante, and a 2016 Porsche Panameran, to transport girls throughout the western United States.</p> <p>The Liddy arrest and the human trafficking ring bust take place during a banner year for pedophile arrests. One analysis at <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/lizcrokin/2017/02/25/why-the-msm-is-ignoring-trumps-sex-trafficking-busts-n2290379" type="external">TownHall.com</a> concludes that in the first few months of the year 2017, there were already more than three times the arrests on pedophilia charges as in the entire year of 2014, at least 1500 across a number of prosecutions in California, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, Michigan, and Illinois.</p> <p>On February 23, within his symbolic first 100 days of office, President Donald Trump held a meeting on human trafficking, which includes victims of child sex slavery, in which he promised to bring the "full weight and force" of the government at the federal level down on human traffickers. The declaration was largely ignored by the mainstream media.</p> <p>Raymond Liddy is the son of G. Gordon Liddy, the Nixon White House operative who became famous during the Watergate scandal.</p> <p>Furor and Frustration Over Pizzagate</p> <p>Despite the brisk pace of law enforcement activity so far this year in pedophile and human trafficking arrests, many followers of the the affair referred to as <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@gizmosia/bananas-wrapped-in-ham-cheese-sauce-luzzatto-kids-for-hot-tubs-warning-for-sensitive-viewers" type="external">Pizzagate</a> in the mainstream media, which has branded it as "fake news," are frustrated law enforcement has not followed up on what they say is evidence which is sufficient to also trigger law enforcement investigation.</p> <p>In one instance, a citizen researcher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnW7OT6Dkuw&amp;feature=youtu.be" type="external">posted what appeared to be</a> a screenshot of an email inbox with a message from a Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department email address, belonging to Officer Marcus Stevens, acknowledging the receipt of attached files. The files, he says are encoded child porn photos which, according to the blogger "Titus Frost," were found in the hard-drive of a computer belonging to James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Pizza in DC.</p> <p>Alefantis recently was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eIuYlNlWo" type="external">Megyn Kelly of Fox News</a> on an ordeal, which was widely reported, when a man with a gun walked into his pizza shop, fired off one shot, and happened to hit the computer closet, possible damaging or destroying the store computer. The incident took place a few days after Frost posted his screenshop image of emails to Officer Marcus Stevens.</p> <p>The arrest of Richard Liddy marks one of the first high-level officials in government to be prosecuted for crimes against children in recent years. In 2016, former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/27/ex-speaker-dennis-hastert-faces-sentencing-chicago/83584440/" type="external">Dennis Hastert</a>, a Republican, was sentenced at a hearing in which the judge called him a "serial child molester." Coincidentally, the Wikileaks dump of emails belonging to Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta showed Podesta to be a friend of Hastert, who sympathized with Hastert's plight before his sentencing, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11508" type="external">once writing</a> "Might be time for Dennis to vanish to some undisclosed Japanese Island."</p> <p>The emails revealed that Podesta is also a friend of James Alefantis, the Comet PIzza shop owner. The social circle comprised of Podesta's friends and brother, the emails showed, have a penchant for <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@munkle/the-pizzagate-images-never-ever-discussed-by-the-fake-news-media" type="external">sexually loaded images</a> involving children and pizza, bizarre, violent art involving them as well, and cryptic talk about "pizza" in what is said to be code talk, with the words "cheese pizza" meaning "child porn."</p> <p>Some Pizzagate investigators and commentators note that, historically, authorities such as the FBI tended to squash high-level pedophile investigations. In the Franklin Scandal, an extensive investigation in the late Eighties and early Nineties, a Nebraska state senator formed a committee to investigate allegations involving Omaha's Boy's Town, a famous orphanage. Both state law enforcement officials and local police believed the witnesses, dozens of children, some of them grown up.</p> <p>But the FBI, instead of following up on the evidence, charged one of the witnesses, Alisha Owens, for perjury, and arranged a tainted grand jury presentation which omitted critical exculpatory evidence. The investigation effectively ended when the lead investigator for the committee, <a type="internal">Gary Caradori, died in a small plane crash</a>.</p> <p>The story of the Franklin Scandal is documented in a film which was pulled by the Discovery Channel at the last minute, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBSIDQt5Dwc" type="external">"Conspiracy of Silence."</a></p> <p>Observers of high-level pedophile investigations have noted that, although most of the pedophile arrests since Trump took office have been executed by local and state authorities, not federal, Trump's high-profile public posture on the issue may have given the green light to what they say are the "white hats" in law enforcement, which they claim is compromised by internal divisions. The Trump administration's stance, they say, may yield state witnesses to investigate and possibly prosecute even those who at this point are only persons of interest in "Pizzagate."</p></article>

	<article id="0000988" published-at="2017-07-28" title="VIDEO: Michael Moore — ‘I Refuse To Live In A Country Where’ Trump Is President’"><p>Good. <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/27/michael-moore-i-refuse-to-live-in-a-country-where-trump-is-president-video/?utm_campaign=thedcmainpage&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=Social" type="external">Don’t let the door hit you</a> in the over-sized ass on the way out. Michael Moore is now declaring that he refuses “to live in a country where Donald Trump is President.” Then he went on to make no sense, except in a revolutionary way when he stated that he also wasn’t planning on leaving. Darn it.</p> <p>He appeared on Colbert’s show (of course) and the two of them went off on President Trump yet again. Moore is calling for the formation of a citizen army to unseat the President. That’s called incitement and he should be prosecuted for it. Then he tried to make it seem like he’s joking (he’s not) and said they have to bring Trump down with satire. Lame.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>From The Daily Caller:</p> <q> <p>Michael Moore says that he refuse “to live in a country where Donald Trump is president.”</p> <p>“I refuse to live in a country where Donald Trump is president and I’m not leaving,” the 63-year-old filmmaker said during his appearance Wednesday night on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”</p> <p>“So somethings gotta change,” he added. “We have to form an army of citizens and come at him like a swarm of bees where he’s hit one way, all the way. Because I think the way to bring him down is with satire.”</p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497732830&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know" type="external">101 Things All Young Adults Should Know</a> by Sir John Hawkins <p>John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Because he can’t take being laughed at.”</p> <p>The filmmaker also went after the president after Trump announced via Twitter that the “United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals” to serve in the military.</p> </q> <p>He’s literally advocating killing Trump with comedy because he is so thin-skinned. Dream on. What a moron. I think he’s doing this just to get airtime and attention. He can’t possibly be serious. Far more people are laughing at Moore and Colbert than they are Trump. Trust me on that one. They looked like unhinged buffoons.</p> <p>Moore of course went after the banning of transgenders in the military, which was the right thing to do and I commend President Trump for it. “What’s so disgusting about this…if you are transgender trying to get by in this society… I can’t think of any more brave people to have then transgender,” Moore explained, adding that those reportedly serving in the military should refuse to leave. Except that depending on what the military decides, they don’t have a say in the matter. But of course, Moore has never served, so he has no idea what he is blathering about.</p> <p>Moore talked about having warned Hillary Clinton about Trump. At least that much he got right. “I actually contacted the people in the Clinton campaign and said ‘I think you need to spend more time in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania,’” Moore said. “These are the Brexit States of America. And there’s a lot of angry people. They don’t sorta like Trump that much, but they see him as their human molotov cocktail that they want to just throw into the system that has hurt them so badly. I couldn’t get anybody to listen to me.”</p> <p>Clinton lost, Trump won and Moore can’t stand it. He should either get over it or leave. I’m all for him leaving frankly. If his only plan is to bludgeon Trump with jokes, then he’s delusional. These people never ever learn.</p></article>
	<article id="0000989" published-at="2017-09-16" title="BREAKING: California Is Officially First ‘Sanctuary State’ – Passed By Senate"><p>We all knew this was coming, but somehow I never really thought they’d go all the way. California just did… early this morning the California legislature voted to approve a bill that would limit police cooperation with federal immigration authorities, according to multiple reports. This officially makes them the first full-fledged sanctuary state in the union. Bonus, yesterday a federal judge ruled against Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the potential to withhold government assistance from Chicago and other so-called sanctuary cities. A showdown is looming and it’s going to get ugly folks.</p> <p>This bill will prohibit additional jail time meant to allow immigration enforcement officials to take undocumented immigrants arrested for other reasons into custody. In other words, it stymies ICE. The measure that passed however will still allow jail and prison officials to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record. But I wouldn’t count on it. ICE will still be able to interview suspects in custody. Governor Jerry Brown is expected to sign the legislation.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>The bill was argued over for some time, but it was passed at the last minute. The final version of the bill was released Monday but California requires bills to be published in their final form for 72 hours before a vote. California’s lower chamber passed the bill on Friday. The California Senate wrapped its session up this morning following the vote.</p> <p>This comes less than one day after that federal judge blocked Jeff Session’s from pulling funding from sanctuary cities. I don’t think that is going to hold up legally though. A number of progressive cities across the country have sought to defy President Trump’s immigration enforcement policies. They require that state and local communities allow federal immigration access to detention facilities and provide 48 hours notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities. Otherwise, these illegal aliens are simply released back into the general population.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>California is the most leftist state in the nation, so it figures this would happen there first. They are broke and have turned themselves into a third-world hellhole. Heck, San Diego is sanitizing the streets because hepatitis killed 15 and sickened 400 this month. That didn’t come from the homeless, it came from illegal aliens bringing it from south of the border. Another deadly gift to Americans. Sacramento is actually ‘paying’ gang bangers now not to kill people. They’ve totally lost it in a communist frenzy over there. Looks like Democrats want to make California Mexico again.</p></article>
	<article id="0000990" published-at="2018-05-01" title="The Left Is Merciless at Keeping Conservatives in the Closet"><p>Dennis Prager is a columnist for The Daily Signal, nationally syndicated radio host, and creator of PragerU.</p> <p>The dominant force in America and many other Western countries today is fear of the left.</p> <p>This is a result of the fact that the most dynamic religion of the past 100 years has been neither Christianity nor Islam. It has been leftism. Whoever does not recognize this does not understand the contemporary world.</p> <p>Leftism—in its incarnations, such as Marxism, communism, and socialism; expressed through egalitarianism, environmentalism, and feminism; in its denigration of capitalism and Western civilization, especially America and Israel; in its supplanting of Christianity and Judaism; through its influence on Christianity and Judaism; in its celebration of race; and in its replacing of reason with romanticism—has almost completely taken over the news and entertainment media and institutions of education.</p> <p>There is a largely (though not entirely) nonviolent reign of ideological terror in America. In almost every area of life, people fear antagonizing the left.</p> <p>Last week, before my speech at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a man employed by the university (I will not say in what department) walked over to me, looked around to see whether anyone was watching, and whispered in my ear, “I’m a conservative.”</p> <p>This happens just about everywhere I speak. People whisper—yes, whisper—that they are conservative or they support President Donald Trump. The last time I experienced people looking around to check whether they were seen speaking to me was with dissidents in the Soviet Union.</p> <p>People call my radio show from all over the country to say that their fellow musicians, nurses, teachers, or employees do not know that they are conservative, let alone that they support the president.</p> <p>I have called contemporary conservatives in America Marranos, the name given during the 15th-century Spanish Inquisition to Jews who hid their Judaism while appearing to be Catholics, lest they be persecuted. I do not compare the consequences: Losing one’s friends or employment is not the same as losing one’s home or one’s life. But otherwise, the label is apt.</p> <p>Because of my <a type="internal">widely covered conducting</a> of the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra at the Walt Disney Concert Hall last summer, members of some of the most prestigious orchestras in America have opened up to me, telling me they are conservative but would never reveal this fact to their fellow musicians. They fear either losing their position or, more likely, being socially ostracized.</p> <p>Why are so many Democrats shocked when a Republican is elected president? Because, as they themselves say, they “don’t know anyone” who voted for the Republican. The primary reason for this is the people in their life who voted for Trump—professional colleagues, and even friends and relatives—are afraid to tell them.</p> <p>There are two reasons the left labels most conservatives and all Trump supporters “white supremacists,” “neo-Nazis,” and “racists.” One is to defeat conservatives without having to defeat conservative ideas. The other is to instill fear: Speak out and you will suffer the consequences.</p> <p>Parents call my radio show and ask what they should tell their children at college when they ask whether they should risk receiving a lower grade for divulging their conservative politics in a paper or on an exam.</p> <p>It is becoming more and more common for leftist mobs to gather in front of a conservative’s home, scream epithets at the conservative’s family members, and vandalize the home. Just last week, the Associated Press reported:</p> <q> <p>Protesters are targeting the northern Virginia home of the National Rifle Association’s top lobbyist … Chris Cox … as well as his wife’s nearby decorating business. … Libby Locke, a lawyer for the Cox family, said the vandalism included spraying fake blood and defacing the home with stickers.</p> </q> <p>Left-wing student mobs routinely take over the offices of university deans, professors, and even presidents. The few non-left-wing professors on any campus understand their lives will be made miserable if they speak out. The widely reported case of liberal biology professor Bret Weinstein at Evergreen State College in Washington is directly on point.</p> <p>In May 2017, Weinstein was surrounded by about 50 left-wing students, who screamed curses at him outside of his classroom for refusing to participate in an event during which white people were asked to leave the campus for a day.</p> <p>On May 24, 2017, Weinstein tweeted: “the police told me I am not safe on campus. They can not protect me.”</p> <q> <p>To be clear: the police told me I am not safe on campus. They can not protect me. Students in jeopardy. No contact from admin. George?</p> <p>— Bret Weinstein (@BretWeinstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/867584422941384705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">May 25, 2017</a></p> </q> <p>Within a few months, left-wing students and the left-wing Evergreen administration made life so miserable for the lifelong liberal professor he left the university.</p> <p>Since the left began spreading the lie that a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, shot a black youth because he, like most police officers, is a racist, police officers in many cities have feared taking proactive measures to prevent violent crime in black neighborhoods. They fear the left-wing mob known as the news media will ruin their reputation and end their career.</p> <p>In the recent case of a Philadelphia Starbucks manager who asked two black men to purchase something before giving them the code to the restroom, Starbucks immediately appeased the left-wing mob. The company didn’t wait until any facts came out; it simply abandoned the manager and announced it would close every U.S. store one day in May to educate all Starbucks employees about “unconscious bias.”</p> <p>These are only a few examples of the left-wing intimidation that dominates much of American life.</p> <p>It does so in large measure because liberals are either too afraid to confront the left or they don’t understand that the American left, not the American right, is the mortal enemy of liberalism.</p></article>
	<article id="0000991" published-at="2018-01-09" title="Breitbart News Just FIRED Steve Bannon. It's A Good Day For Andrew Breitbart's Legacy."><p>On Tuesday, Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon — a man who used his position to shift Breitbart News into a propaganda outlet on behalf of his own political interests — found himself jobless and perhaps homeless after being unceremoniously fired by the Breitbart News board. That firing, spearheaded by the Mercer family, followed hard on President Trump destroying Bannon in a public statement after Bannon told muckraking author Michael Wolff that the Trump campaign had engaged in criminal and treasonous activity. Bannon also ushered Wolff into the heart of the West Wing, where Wolff used his position to cobble together his bestselling gossip book, Fire and Fury.</p> <p>Bannon’s ouster is a long time in coming. Actually, Bannon never should have been hired in the first place. He was not a close friend of Andrew Breitbart’s; he was instead a fellow who attempted to use his minimal documentary-making skills to ingratiate himself with Breitbart, making a movie with Breitbart as narrator. That unwatchable monstrosity was Bannon’s calling card after Breitbart died; Larry Solov, Breitbart’s business partner and lifelong friend, turned to Bannon in the aftermath of Breitbart’s tragic passing.</p> <p>Bannon gradually began exerting more and more control over editorial of the site; by 2015, as outside observers noted, Bannon had shifted the site into fully political, DC-centric, Trumpian territory. This wasn’t at all what Andrew had intended: Andrew saw the site as a weapon in the fight against what he called the “Democrat-Media Complex,” destroying left-wing narratives crafted by the faux-objective media. Andrew believed that his site could play an outsized role in the culture war, and he saw culture as upstream of politics. And Andrew wanted to do so in the mold of the “happy warrior,” not as the grim-faced, stubble-bearded force of darkness Bannon attempted to project.</p> <p>Bannon, by contrast, saw the site as a lever to exert influence in the circles of power — or at least the impression of influence. And he would abuse and use anyone he needed to in order to pose as Darth Vader.</p> <p>By January 2016, it was clear to anyone with two eyes that Bannon had transformed the site into a propaganda outlet on behalf of the Trump campaign, and weaponized the site against Trump’s opponents. That wasn’t out of pure love for Trump — it was out of a pathetic desire to hitch his wagon to the next rising star.</p> <p>And it got worse: Bannon decided that he would make common cause with the execrable alt-right in order to maximize his influence. To that end, he elevated Milo Yiannopoulos, bragged about making a site founded by a proud anti-racist into a “platform for the alt-right,” and used the site as his personal vendetta machine.</p> <p>Bannon rode Trump’s star all the way to the White House — all the while, bragging that he was the real brains behind the operation. In reality, he had little to do with Trump’s success: he was only on the Trump campaign at all because the Mercers placed him there, along with Kellyanne Conway. Then, in the White House, he spent his days botching policy (see the original travel ban rollout) and pushing Trump to ally with awful people (see his reported advice on Charlottesville) and posturing as the Great Thinker of Trumpism — meanwhile leaking to the press as much as he could about his enemies inside the administration and the supposed dunderhead he had to shepherd through basic tasks.</p> <p>Finally, in August, Trump dumped him. And Bannon went right back to the “machine” he had built, ready to maximize his own profile. He launched a doomed campaign on behalf of Alabama’s Roy Moore, and somehow suckered Trump into endorsing Moore; he even deployed reporters to Alabama to try to debunk Moore’s alleged molestation victims, knowing full well that they were credible. He lost.</p> <p>And then, finally, the chickens came home to roost: all of that backbiting and self-promoting blew him up when Wolff’s book came out. Trump can abide anything but disloyalty. And Bannon, it turns out — as all of us who knew him knew — is a deeply disloyal human being.</p> <p>Thus he had to go.</p> <p>Steve Bannon has never built anything; he is a creature of destruction. He rides more powerful hosts until they drop beneath him, whispering sweet nothings in their ears. He tried to glom onto Sarah Palin’s celebrity. He did the same with Michele Bachmann, Andrew Breitbart, and Trump. All of those people built things. Bannon built nothing. He just stood atop the foundations they had erected, shouting his own name.</p> <p>Now, he has nothing. He built a monument to himself, and it collapsed. He has no money; the Mercers are out. He has no power; the White House is out. He has no bullhorn: Breitbart is out. He's back to what he had originally: his cunning and his nastiness and his shameless sycophancy-for-hire. Good luck to him.</p> <p>So, where does Breitbart go from here? The great tragedy in all of this is that Breitbart’s name has been smeared with Bannon’s toxicity. Now they’ll have to rebuild. They can do so by either returning to Andrew’s original mission, which would require some humility, some decency — or they can become a shadow of their former Bannon.com glory, trying to pander to political patrons rather than standing for truth. That’s their choice.</p> <p>But at least for today, it’s a good day for Andrew Breitbart. May they all be good days from now on.</p></article>

A man can never be a woman and vice versa.</p> <p>Or maybe her hormone therapy included some hallucinogens...</p> <p>Sadly, The way I see the situation finally being resolved will eventually involve Republicans, not wanting to appear homophobic so they pass laws that cover sexual orientation only, and do not mention gender identity at all. Democrats are far too steeped in the SJW quicksand to ever consider doing this.</p> <p>I'm really beginning to hate those people - and the stupid ass idiots who are enabling them to evangelize their stupidity.</p> <p>Hypocrites - imagine what they'd say if we started saying stuff like that about them. They're melt if we use the "wrong" pronoun, let alone spouting unfounded psychobabble drivel about them.</p> <p>So now we're to be lectured and demeaned by a heterosexual woman (because that's what this Person would say she is).</p> <p>In any other situation, the perpetrator would be told she was deeply homophobic, and to fuck off.</p> <p>Why I stopped reading "the gay press". Fucking hate speech. The author of the interview (not the trans interviewee) adds this teeny tiny editorial note: "This may seem like a controversial statement, but it is something that Juno has experienced since she came out as trans."</p> <p>Fucking hate speech is what it is.</p></article>

	<article id="0000995" published-at="2017-05-31" title="Bernie Sanders to College Graduates: Take on the Fossil Fuel Industry, Transform Our Energy System"><p>Sen. <a type="internal">Bernie Sanders</a> delivered the commencement address at Brooklyn College on Tuesday and told graduating students that entering an "oligarchic" society, like one the U.S. is fast becoming, will demand vigilance and perseverance on their parts but that it was because of determined young people that he has "enormous confidence" in the country's ultimate future.</p> <p>Sanders recounted learning about "oligarchic societies" when he was a high school student in Brooklyn. Described to him as "small developing countries" in which the "economic and political life of the nation were controlled by a handful of very wealthy people," Sanders admitted it "never occurred to me as a kid in Brooklyn that the United States of America, our great nation, could move in that direction." But, he added, "that is precisely ... what is happening today."</p> <q> <p>Bernie Sanders: 'This Is Exactly What We Mean When We Talk About Oligarchy' https://t.co/8gqKgk0NZ8 @OpenSecretsDC @SunFoundation</p> — EcoWatch (@EcoWatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/EcoWatch/statuses/857401441497092100" type="external">1493255408.0</a> </q> <p>While commending graduating students and their parents for often working multiple jobs in order to make ends meet, Sanders lamented that more than fifty percent of all new income now "goes to the top one percent" of earners.</p> <p>And in order to disrupt and combat such a system, Sanders said that throwing up your hands and giving up was simply not a viable option.</p> <p>"The truth is that the only rational choice we have, the only real response we can make is to stand up and fight back—reclaim American democracy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent," he said. "And for us to do that it is necessary that we fight for a vision of a new America. An America based on progressive, humane values, not the values of the oligarchy."</p> <p>As he railed against economic inequality and a system rigged in favor of the wealthy and powerful, Sanders told students that unity would be key in order to defeat the destructive forces represented by President <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Sanders referenced his Jewish heritage and his family's experience with the Holocaust in Europe, which he said offered important lessons for "tough times" like these.</p> <p>"From that experience, what was indelibly stamped on my mind was the understanding that we must never allow demagogues to divide us up by race, by religion, by national origin, by gender or sexual orientation," Sanders said to wide applause. "Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American, Christian, Jew, Muslim and every religion, straight or gay, male or female—we must stand together. This country belongs to all of us."</p> <p>Sanders concluded on a message of hope, telling the graduates that Americans are "prepared to stand together; if we take on greed and selfishness; if we refuse to allow demagogues to divide us up there is no end to what the great people of our nation can accomplish."</p> <p>Watch the full commencement address:</p> <p>The full transcript of Sanders remarks follows:</p> <p>You know and I know that these are tough times for our country. But I do want to say that standing up here and looking out at the beautiful people in front of me, I have enormous confidence in the future of our country.</p> <p>Let me begin by congratulating the graduating class of 2017. Today is an important day in your lives, something that I know you have worked very hard to achieve, and I want to wish all of you the very best of luck in your future endeavors.</p> <p>I do want, on behalf of my wife, Jane, and myself, to pray that you all live healthy and happy lives, doing the work you enjoy surrounded in love by family and friends.</p> <p>Let me thank President Michelle Anderson, Nicole Haas, the Brooklyn College Administration, faculty and staff and all of you for inviting Jane and me back to Brooklyn where we were both born and raised. I am greatly honored of the honorary degree you have given me.</p> <p>I grew up in Flatbush and, like Senator Schumer, graduated from James Madison High School. My wife, Jane, was also raised Flatbush and Bedford-Stuyvesant, and graduated from St. Savior's High School a few miles away from here.</p> <p>In 1959, as a first-generation college student I attended Brooklyn College for a year—a year which had a major impact in my life. After that year I left for the University of Chicago, where I eventually graduated. My mom had died the previous year and I felt it was time to leave the neighborhood and see what the rest of the world looked like.</p> <p>My childhood in Brooklyn was shaped by two profound realities. First, my mom, dad and older brother, who graduated from Brooklyn College, lived in a 3 1/2 room rent-controlled apartment. As with many of your families who don't have a lot of money, financial pressures caused friction and tension within our household. From those experiences of growing up without a lot of money, I have never forgotten that there are millions of people throughout this country who struggle to put food on the table, pay the electric bill, try to save for their kids' education or for retirement—people who against great odds are fighting today to live in dignity.</p> <p>The second reality that impacted my life was that my father left Poland at the age of 17 from a community which was not only very poor, but from a country where anti-Semitism, pogroms and attacks on Jews were not uncommon. While my father emigrated to the United States, and escaped Hitler and the Holocaust, many in his family did not. For them, racism, right-wing extremism and ultra-nationalism were not "political issues." They were issues of life and death—and some of them died horrific deaths.</p> <p>From that experience, what was indelibly stamped on my mind was the understanding that we must never allow demagogues to divide us up by race, by religion, by national origin, by gender or sexual orientation. Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American, Christian, Jew, Muslim and every religion, straight or gay, male or female, we must stand together. This country belongs to all of us.</p> <p>As a United States senator from Vermont let me give you a very brief overview of some of the serious crises we currently face—crises which do not often get attention they deserve.</p> <p>As a student at James Madison High School, many years ago, I recall my social studies teacher talking about how there were small developing countries around the world that were "oligarchic" societies—places where the economic and political life of the nation were controlled by a handful of very wealthy people. It never occurred to me as a kid in Brooklyn that the United States of America, our great nation, could move in that direction. But that is precisely, in my view, what is happening today.</p> <p>Today, the top one-tenth of one percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Twenty Americans now own as much wealth as the bottom half of America and one family now owns more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of our people. In the last 17 years, while the middle class continues to decline, we have seen a tenfold increase in the number of billionaires. Today in America CEOs are earning almost 350 times more than the average worker makes. In terms of income, while you and your parents are working in some cases two or three jobs, 52 percent of all new income goes to the top one percent.</p> <p>At the same time as we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major nation, 43 million Americans live in poverty, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country in earth, half of older workers have nothing in the bank as they approach retirement and in some inner cities and rural communities, youth unemployment is 20, 30, 40 percent. Unbelievably, in our country today as a result of hopelessness and despair we are seeing a decline in life expectancy. People are giving up. And they're turning to drugs, to alcohol, and even to suicide. And because of poverty, racism today in a broken criminal justice system we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. Those people are disproportionately black, Latino and Native American.</p> <p>Directly related to the oligarchic economy that we currently have is corrupt political system which is undermining American democracy and it's important we talk about that and understand that. As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, corporations and billionaires are able to spend unlimited sums of money on elections. The result is that today a handful of billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars every single year, often on ugly 30-second TV ads, helping to elect candidates who represent the rich and the powerful get elected.</p> <p>And we are seeing the results of how oligarchy functions right now in Congress where the Republican leadership wants to throw 23 million American off of health insurance, cut Medicaid by over $800 billion, defund Planned Parenthood, cut food stamps and other nutrition programs by over $200 billion, cut Head Start and after school programs, and by the way, make drastic cuts in Pell grants and other programs that help working class kids be able to go to college.</p> <p>And, unbelievably, at exactly the same time that they are throwing people off health care, making it harder to people to go to college, they have the chutzpah to provide the $300 billion in tax breaks to the top one percent. In other words, the very, very rich are getting richer and they get huge tax cuts. The working class and the middle class are struggling and they are seeing drastic cuts in life or death programs that could mean survival or not for those families.</p> <p>Now, in response to these very serious crises it seems to me that we have two choices. First we can throw up our hands in despair. We can say, "I am not going to get involved."</p> <p>That is understandable. But it is wrong.</p> <p>Because the issues that we deal with today—the economic issues, the social issues, the racial issues, the environmental issues—not only impact your lives, they impact the lives of future generations and you do not have the moral right to turn your back on saving this planet and saving future generations.</p> <p>The truth is that the only rational choice we have, the only real response we can make is to stand up and fight back — reclaim American democracy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent.</p> <p>And for us to do that it is necessary that we fight for a vision of a new America. An America based on progressive, humane values, not the values of the oligarchy.</p> <p>And what does that mean, briefly in concrete terms?</p> <p>It means that, no, we are not going to throw 23 million Americans off the health care they have. We are going to bring about health care for all as a right, not a privilege.</p> <p>It means that, no, we are not, as the current administration does, deny the reality of climate change. We are going to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.</p> <p>It means no we are not going to cut Pell grants and other student assistance. We are going to do what Germany, what Scandinavia, what countries all over the world do. And that is to make certain the public colleges and universities are tuition-free and we're going to significantly lower student debt because we believe that anyone in America who has the ability and the desire to be able to get a higher education regardless of his or her income.</p> <p>And no we're not going to do what the attorney general of the United States now wants. We're not going to put more people in jail. We're going to fix a broken criminal justice system and invest in education and jobs for our young people, not more jails and incarceration.</p> <p>No, we're not going to defund Planned Parenthood. We're going to vigorously defend a woman's right to choose.</p> <p>My friends, let me conclude by saying this. We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world. We are seeing exploding technology, which if used well, has extraordinary potential to improve life. We are an intelligent and hardworking people. If we are prepared to stand together; if we take on greed and selfishness; if we refuse to allow demagogues to divide us up there is no end to what the great people of our nation can accomplish.</p> <p>So today as you graduate Brooklyn College, my message to you is very simple. Think big, not small, and help us create the nation that we all know we can become. Thank you all very much.</p> <p>Reposted with permission from our media associate <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/05/30/come-together-and-fight-oligarchy-declares-sanders-stirring-commencement" type="external">Common Dreams</a>.</p></article>
	<article id="0000996" published-at="2017-11-17" title="It’s Time To Purge The Pervs From Politics—And Let Women Step In"><p>This story reflects the views of this author, but not necessarily the editorial position of Fast Company.</p> <p>On November 9, 2016, Hillary Clinton, fresh from defeat by a pussy-grabbing misogynist, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/hillary-clinton-concession-speech/index.html" type="external">predicted better times ahead for women:</a> “Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will–and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.”</p> <p>One year later, the glass ceiling remains intact, especially in politics. Women <a href="http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2017" type="external">currently make up</a> only 19.6% of the House of Representatives, 21% of the Senate, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/80-percent-of-trumps-appointees-are-men/#" type="external">and only 20% of President Trump’s cabinet</a>.</p> <p>But while men still hold most of the power, the country’s faith in men is starting to shatter, with every shard reflecting back a seemingly endless array of famous sexual predators. Every day, more prominent men in politics, <a type="internal">entertainment, media, and tech are revealed to have sexually harassed or assaulted women.</a></p> <p>Perhaps–just perhaps–the political power structure is due for a change.</p> <p>America is not experiencing an epidemic of sexual predation so much as an epidemic of revelation, as a wave of rage and validation propels survivors to step forward. A national conversation is now happening. As a country we’ve had this conversation before– in 1991, when Anita Hill’s testimony against Clarence Thomas brought the term “sexual harassment” into the mainstream; in 1998, when Bill Clinton’s relationship with Monica Lewinsky spotlighted male abuse of power over female subordinates (additionally, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/1/6/10722580/bill-clinton-juanita-broaddrick" type="external">he was accused of rape</a>); and in 2016, when Donald Trump–who over multiple decades has been accused of <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-rape-sexual-assault-minor-wife-business-victims-roy-moore-713531" type="external">raping his first wife as well as a 13-year-old girl</a>, <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/fox-pundit-rejects-weinstein-comparison-says-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-are-childs-play-dd198091a7c8/" type="external">sexually assaulting 15 women,</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-miss-usa-pageant-dressing-rooms" type="external">peeping on teenage girls</a> as they changed their clothes, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/8/13110734/donald-trump-leaked-audio-recording-billy-bush-sexism" type="external">other acts of misogynist abuse</a> –became president. These “national conversations” generally ended with the women being publicly disparaged and the men facing few consequences.</p> <p>This time feels different.</p> <p>For the most part, women are actually being believed. Lifelong sexual predators are being forced to resign, undergo investigations, and even face criminal charges. <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/rebecca-traister-on-the-post-weinstein-reckoning.html" type="external">Feminist writers warn, rightly, that a backlash looms</a>. But in the meantime, a lesson is being driven home: Don’t put male politicians on pedestals, unless you want to clean up the damage when they fall.</p> <p>This was not the lesson <a href="https://theopedproject.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/the-byline-survey-2011/" type="external">the male-dominated media</a> wanted to teach us. Following Trump’s win, a flurry of editorials were written on the fallacy of “identity politics” and the importance of centering the needs of beleaguered white men, so that they would not elect an emotionally unhinged white supremacist sexual assaulter in the future. This was the wrong takeaway from 2016; what we really needed, to borrow a phrase from the Groper-in-Chief, was extreme vetting.</p> <p>Imagine a world in which these powerful male predators had been outed earlier: the pain that would have been avoided, the lives that wouldn’t have been destroyed. Imagine what women could have accomplished in a society where they assumed they would be believed, that abuse would not be tolerated, that their workplace was safe. Imagine if Congress weren’t <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/deliberating-bodies-sexism-congress" type="external">infamously sexist</a>. Imagine if the public <a href="https://www.the-pool.com/news-views/politics/2017/11/women-can-t-be-trusted-in-politics-says-a-new-survey" type="external">trusted women politicians</a> as much as men.</p> <p>Democratic senator Al Franken is being <a type="internal">pressured to resign</a>in the wake of sexual harassment allegations, and Republican senate candidate Roy Moore’s own party is calling to for him to drop out of the race after multiple accusations that he has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/roy-moore-accuser-banned-mall/story?id=51195632" type="external">preyed on several teenage girls</a>. One can reasonably assume, given recent revelations on the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/14/politics/sexual-harassment-congress/index.html" type="external">pervasiveness of sexual assault on Capitol Hil</a>l, that more allegations about elected officials are to come.</p> <p>What to do with a polity of perverts? The answer is clear–they have to go. After all, it’s not as if it’s difficult to replace them. For every vile man, there are many talented women who have been hesitant to enter a sexist political arena. It is time to clean the House–and the Senate, and most of all, the Oval Office.</p> <p>That Trump, whose record of misogynist abuse is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html" type="external">long</a>and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/donald-trumps-unconscious-unending-sexism" type="external">documented</a>, still presides over this nation as other powerful men face consequences is a travesty. He is unfit to lead for multiple reasons, as the many <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/politics/cohen-articles-of-impeachment/index.html" type="external">articles of impeachment</a> filed against him indicate. Trump’s abuse of executive privilege and his abuse of women are not unrelated–like many powerful men, he committed horrific acts in part simply because he could. For decades, he has gotten away with <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-drugs-corruption-panama-hotel-money-laundering-714891" type="external">horrendous</a>, likely <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/donald-trump-2016-mob-organized-crime-213910" type="external">illegal</a>, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/donald-trump-model-management-illegal-immigration/" type="external">behavior</a>.

Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/908651641943003136" type="external">chimed in</a>, finding time in his busy, busy schedule of firing off tweets about North Korea, terrorist attacks in London and “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U" type="external">The Wall</a>” to defecate out a tweet condemning ESPN, saying they — like most of the other news media, apparently — are failing.</p> <p>The White House then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/09/12/espn-scolds-host-jemele-hill-for-calling-president-trump-a-white-supremacist-on-twitter/?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.06555a600901" type="external">commented on the matter</a>, saying that Hill’s comments were a fireable offense — which may be the scariest takeaway from this whole thing. Think about it: The White House clamored for a private company to fire an employee over a political opinion. That way leads to totalitarianism, my friends.</p> <p>ESPN reportedly <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/exactly-what-happened-to-jemele-hill-and-michael-smith-at-espn-on-wednesday-03a5aa226620/" type="external">sent her home after a contentious meeting on Wednesday</a>, but couldn’t find a replacement for her when co-host Michael Smith refused to go on the air without her.</p> <q> <p>According to <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/jemele-hill-espn-off-air-53f2a4baf1af/" type="external">ThinkProgress</a>, which Thursday cited “two sources familiar with the situation,” the sports network “reached out to two other black ESPN hosts,” Michael Eaves and Elle Duncan, to take Hill’s place that evening. They declined, and Smith reportedly also refused to do the show without Hill.</p> </q> <p>Somehow, Jemele Hill finds herself smack dab in the middle of a racial maelstrom that has been ravaging our country since its inception. But, now, it is churning more violently out of control than ever. Donald Trump’s rise to power — borne on the wings of racially-charged, vitriolic rhetoric coupled with a promise to restore young, disenfranchised white men to power — has been like throwing accelerant on a fire that never really stopped burning.</p> <p>Recently, TMZ tracked down <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/24285/kevin-durant" type="external">Kevin Durant</a> and asked him what he thought about the whole mess. Durant, unsurprisingly, stood behind Hill. Why would he waver? He’s already made it clear he <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/17/durant-wont-visit-white-house-if-asked-due-to-president-trump/" type="external">would not visit the White House</a> if invited, and has said quite literally he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbxir4QtEg8" type="external">“doesn’t f—k with” Trump.</a></p> <p>Well, it might be pretty obvious, but we support Jemele Hill as well. You can’t lie if you’re not wrong, and Jemele was not wrong about Donald Trump.</p> <p>Donald Trump is an embarrassment to our great nation. He has, as Hill said, “surrounded himself with white supremacists.” He has had a HUGE hand in encouraging the violence and discord we see sweeping our country, most recently in Charlottesville, where thousands of neo-Nazis and white supremacists took to the streets, chanting his name as if it were their literal battle cry.</p> <p>A young woman died that day.</p> <p>Sure, Trump wasn’t behind the wheel of that death car, but he was the one pumping the tank full of gas.</p> "I'm behind Jemele. I support her. That’s what it’s all about. She’s standing up for what she believes in. I’m with it." - Kevin Durant <p>Trump is a danger to our country, to our stability, to our future, to our youth, and to every single person of color, no matter their race or place of origin.</p> <p>He stands for violence. He stands for intolerance. We see black people being <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jason-stockley-not-guilty-verdict-protest-police-st-louis-live-updates/" type="external">murdered in the streets</a> by the very people who have sworn to protect them. We see anger, filth, and racially driven discriminatory laws being dragged across the White House steps. There is a travel ban. There is gerrymandering.</p> <p>This is not a f*cking joke. This is real. Our great nation is tearing itself apart, and the only thing Trump is presiding over is its quickening destruction.</p> <p>I, for one, stand alongside Jemele Hill, and stand up with every single other person who has a conscience and who wants to see equality in this country.</p> <p>I stand with everyone who wants to see peace. Who can’t stand the thought of Nazis in the White House, or white supremacists openly marching in our streets, calling out Trump’s name while he does nothing to hinder them. I stand with everyone who feels like we’ve made a critical error that will take decades to unravel, if ever we can climb out of this hole.</p> <p>Our history as Americans is littered with missteps and violent deeds. Let us not stand idly by while we add another chapter to the sad volume of our uncaring past.</p> <p>Now go ahead and tell me to stick to sports. I dare you.</p></article>
	<article id="0000998" published-at="2017-08-18" title="Don't Forget About the Liberal Fascists"><p>To be clear, this column is about influential media pundits and reporters choosing which violent groups they report ... and which they ignore.</p> <p>“... anti-fascists stand up and kick the -- — out of fascists. That’s what we need!”</p> <p>As reported by The Daily Caller, that’s Norman Clement, a member of the left-wing ANSWER Coalition, introducing speakers at a Hartford, Connecticut, Sunday night vigil to “reflect” on the Charlottesville violence over the weekend.</p> <p>This profane rallying cry for violence on whomever they decide is a fascist was directed to the hundreds of attendees, including New Haven mayoral candidate Marcus Paca and current Mayor Toni Harp.</p> <p>It’s reflective of the violence fomented at Trump rallies by Scott Foval, former national field director of the left-wing Americans United for Change.</p> <p>He confessed, on video, of staging the violence at Trump rallies for the Democratic National Committee to provoke Trump supporters into violence.</p> <p>In Berkeley, California this year, left-wing activists attacked unarmed Trump supporters, hurled Molotov cocktails and smashed windows in protest of a planned speech by conservative antagonist Milo Yiannopoulos, causing $100,000 in property damage.</p> <p>On top of that was an incident where two Berkeley College Republicans “were attacked while conducting an interview” on the campus, and another where a woman wearing a red Trump hat was pepper-sprayed in the face while being interviewed by a local CNN affiliate.</p> <p>This is the violent left that pundits “outraged” at Trump’s incompetent initial articulation dangerously ignore.</p> <p>After an unsatisfying statement excoriating violence “on both sides” while shockingly omitting any reference to the murdered Heather Heyer, Trump later clearly denounced the Klan and white supremacists as “criminals” and “thugs.”</p> <p>“You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch,” Trump said.</p> <p>“It is impossible to imagine President Trump saying that both sides are responsible for the violence, saying that the people that came out against these extremists are equally to blame,” said The Lead host Jake Tapper.</p> <p>“This is a sad moment for the country,” opined Don Lemon. “I think it was an awful moment for the person who is supposed to represent the highest office of the land.”</p> <p>“There today,” he told, Wolf Blitzer, “you saw the real Donald Trump proving all of his critics right in that moment.”</p> <p>Lemon defended the alt-left group because “that group protests fascism. So that group was protesting fascism.” Then, Lemon forgave the left-wing violence saying, “Maybe their tactics weren’t exactly right ... it’s messy.”</p> <p>Their tactics were to come to the white supremacist rally armed with bats and pepper spray and attack the racists. That’s messy, alright. Lemon ignored those violent thugs because the other side “is a Nazi, white supremacist group” and “what they want to do in their hearts is extinguish people who look like me and who look like you, Wolf, Jewish people, black people, even women.” They overlook that the violent left is also using fascist tactics, and if their ultimate goal is an all-powerful government with control over its people and businesses, as many espouse, then they, too are fascists.</p> <p>Yes, the klan and white supremacists are evil and, as Republican Ted Cruz says, “These bigots want to tear our country apart, but they will fail. America is far better than this.”</p> <p>I hope so, because while it’s as easy to hate Nazis as it is to love puppies, CNN seems to have an especially difficult time accepting the fact that there are leftwing criminals and thugs ideologically justifying violence.</p> <p>By ignoring and forgiving the violent left, are the Don Lemons of the media suggesting the shooting of Republican Representative Steve Scalise by a left-winger is not so bad compared to the murder of Heather Heyer by a neo-nazi?</p> <p>Once violence is accepted as legitimate political speech, only violence remains.</p> <p>The writer is from Delaware and is an award-winning conservative talk show host on WDEL radio.

	<article id="0000999" published-at="2017-10-09" title="Political paranoia in the 21st century"><p>Evil versus good. No, that’s too deep and overarching. How about Republican versus Democrat or conservative versus liberal? Populist versus elitist? Nationalist versus globalist? Let’s not forget capitalist versus socialist and Libertarian versus fascist.</p> <p>My point is this: Political labels abound and leave much to be desired. They signify different things to different people, if they signify anything at all. Some are pejoratives: Calling a pol a populist may elicit a smile or a sneer.</p> <p>Some cover so much of the political spectrum, they are meaningless. The average American would be hard-pressed to define Libertarian. For that matter, the average Libertarian would be hard-pressed to define Libertarian. Labels are purely a convenience, a bit of necessary mental laziness we rely on daily. They serve to evoke but seldom accurately portray one’s beliefs or principles.</p> <p>Still, some adjectives do have a place in our political dialogue and it is at the edges where they may be the most accurate. There, the one label that is quite appropriate, that applies strikingly to our present political situation, and especially to the radical right, is “paranoid.”</p> <p>(The radical left is not immune to this affliction but a cursory reading of history finds the far right more heavily infected.) It is at the edges of sanity and society where one finds the ideologues holed up in the confines of their mental rigidity and dogmatism hiding from a world that is out to get them. There are only a few ways to say “crazy” and they are all unambiguous.</p> <p>Those of you who have read Richard Hofstadter’s essay, “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” will see his influence here. Let me quote him: “In recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme right-wingers, who have demonstrated […] how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and passions of a small minority.”</p> <p>He was writing about Arizonan Barry Goldwater’s run for the White House in 1964 but one could substitute Donald Trump and the alt-right here and do no harm. It is spookily parallel to the present day.</p> <p>Of the anti-Masonic (read anti-liberal or pro-conformity, if you will) movement of the early 1800s, he writes, “It attracted the support of several reputable statesmen who had only mild sympathy with its fundamental bias but who as politicians could not afford to ignore it. Still, it was a folk movement of considerable power, and the rural enthusiasts who provided its real impetus believed in it wholeheartedly.”</p> <p>This is another uncanny parallel to our current dilemma. Replace “folk movement” with the current populist reincarnation and it loses no relevancy. And there are more than a few latter-day “reputable statesmen” to the right of center who prize re-election over integrity and honesty.</p> <p>Paul Ryan occasionally loses patience with Trump but is not going to abandon him and his chance to push the right-wing agenda. He gives the president a mulligan, claiming, “He’s new at government.” What a lame dodge! Why would you put a landlubber at the helm of state? (Ironically, it is Barry Goldwater’s home state of Arizona that has given us Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain, men of conscience who do not shrink from criticizing the president.)</p> <p>Hofstadter continues, “I call it the paranoid style simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy I have in mind.”</p> <p>Heated exaggeration? Trump claims the biggest inaugural crowds ever, the largest electoral win since Reagan, and $10 billion in the bank. Suspiciousness? Obama tapped my phone, the election is rigged and Comey is out to get me. Conspiratorial fantasy? The fake news is persecuting me, Ted Cruz’s father had ties to Lee Harvey Oswald, and global warming is a Chinese plot.</p> <p>Steve Bannon is a versed conspiracist and political trickster who sees bogeymen everywhere, qualifications that will serve him well in his return to Breitbart.</p> <p>He also delivered the most heated exaggeration of all, touting the ineloquent Trump as the greatest public speaker since William Jennings Bryan, a statement so baldly absurd, no rebuttal is needed. Stumping at a rally for Alabama Sen.-elect, Roy Moore, Bannon whipped the crowd into a frenzy, urging them to show the world “that this populist, nationalist, conservative movement is on the rise.”</p> <p>He is the picture of demagoguery. A 74-year-old widow at the rally explained her vote for Moore, “Steve Bannon and God spoke to me […] and I voted for Moore.” It is a scary mentality that puts Bannon and God in the same sentence and gives Bannon top billing. Spookiness again.</p> <p>Ultimately, the method becomes the message and the paranoid style overpowers any sound ideas its adherents may put forth.</p> <p>America has survived these political mood swings in the past and we will survive them today. Trump’s election triggered the pressure valve. We will undo the damage done. And all the radical right’s exaggerations, suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasies cannot change that.</p> <p>Malcolm Hein lives in Newburyport.</p></article>
	<article id="0001000" published-at="2017-10-11" title="We won’t forget: How Hypable will cover Hollywood’s alleged abusers"><p>All of us at Hypable have been disturbed by recent reports concerning one of Hollywood’s biggest producers, Harvey Weinstein. We strongly condemn his behavior and believe each and every woman who has spoken out about what he did to them.</p> <p>Unfortunately, one of the sunniest cities in America is also the darkest: This is not new behavior in Hollywood. People are frequently taken advantage of because people in positions of power believe they can get away with it. This can’t be how Hollywood works. Abusers can’t get away with their actions because they hold keys to success, or have enough money to pay off their victims.</p> <p>The stories (read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html" type="external">this New York Times report</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories" type="external">this New Yorker report</a>) that have come out about Weinstein have caused us to seriously think about how we cover the entertainment business, and we’ve come to an editorial decision that best balances the need to report on fandom with the need to hold Hollywood accountable.</p> <p>We can’t forget what people like Weinstein have done. We can’t let the studios sweep these stories under the rug. Forgetting is how these men get away with their behavior time and time again. So beginning immediately, Hypable will add a note to all articles about a film, TV show, book, etc. that employs an accused predator. We will include a link to a reputable report so you can educate yourself on what they’ve been accused of doing.</p> <p>Here are a few people we will be reminding you about in every article that pertains to a film they’re tied to:</p> <p>— Johnny Depp has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/19/12555646/amber-heard-johnny-depp-domestic-abuse-divorce" type="external">accused by his ex-wife Amber Heard</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4631436/Johnny-Depp-s-team-knew-alleged-abuse-Amber-Heard.html" type="external">ex-associates</a> of physically abusing the former. This will be noted in every article about Fantastic Beasts, Pirates of the Caribbean, and any other film that he’s associated with.</p> <p>– Bryan Singer <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bryan-singer-sex-abuse-case-699828" type="external">has been accused of</a> sexually abusing young men for decades. This will be noted in every article about his next film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727824/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_2" type="external">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, as well as X-Men, a franchise he has directed and continues to be a producer on.</p> <p>– Woody Allen, who recently worked with Amazon on two projects, has been accused of sexual abusing his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, amongst <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-history-sexual-abuse-allegations-woody-allen-20160719-story.html" type="external">other allegations</a>.</p> <p>– Harvey Weinstein. If we cover any of his upcoming films that he’s produced, we will remind you about the women who spoke to The New York Times and The New Yorker. While he has been fired since the bombshell reports on his behavior, several of his business associates knew about his conduct and did nothing to stop it.</p> <p>And the list goes on. We’ll inform you about other alleged predators, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/casey-afflecks-dark-secret-the-disturbing-allegations-against-the-oscar-hopeful" type="external">like Casey Affleck</a>, when we cover their films. We’ll continue to internally discuss who to tell you about as new information comes to light.</p> <p>The studios and their publicists are hoping you forget about the accusations so their projects aren’t negatively affected, but at Hypable, forgetting is over. We will not forget what these people did, or in some cases, still do. These people need to be removed from Hollywood.</p> <p>“The predator wants your silence,” Viola Davis said in <a href="http://variety.com/2017/film/news/viola-davis-harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-1202586232/" type="external">a statement</a> to victims on Tuesday. The media can no longer grant them that benefit.</p> <p>This morning, in honor of Hollywood’s survivors, Hypable made a $500 donation to Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU star Mariska Hargitay’s <a href="http://www.joyfulheartfoundation.org/" type="external">Joyful Heart Foundation</a>, which “paves the way for innovative approaches to treating trauma, igniting shifts in the way the public responds to sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse, and advancing policies and legislation to ensure justice for survivors.”</p> <p>We encourage other websites to take a similar editorial strategy, or rethink how they cover predators. Change needs to happen now — let’s do it.</p></article>

Polls show that over 80 percent of Americans believe that the DACA kids, many of whom were newborn or toddlers when they were brought to America, should be allowed stay.</p> <p>That wish for them to stay is the generous vision of America that so many Americans share.

	<article id="0001003" published-at="2017-07-11" title="Criminals With Violent Histories Respect FEAR">
Criminals With Violent Histories Respect FEAR <p>It makes no difference if you have a PhD in psychology, sociology, criminology, or any social engineering field. If you do not have hands-on experience in the field, on the road, working with the miscreants of society, you don’t know . . . Well, you know how that ends.</p> <p>In my experience, most people will react in a positive, if not a hesitant manner, with logical motivation, especially if you treat them with respect. However, there are those in a minority group of violent, repetitive thugs, criminals, animals that respect one thing, and only one thing. FEAR! You can try to conjole them, placate them into calm, and handle them with kid gloves to no avail. They do understand pepper spray, ASP, PR-24, Taser, and gunshot wounds. If you put fear into their heads, they will react with a certain amount of respect, usually in your favor. Sometimes, though, the only way to protect yourself from these animals is by shooting them in self-defense.</p> <p>When you have a rapist, pedophile, abusive spouse/parent/sibling/child, armed robber, murderer, it is unlikely, if they have a history of these types of arrests, that they will ever result in a full and positive rehabilitation of their malevolent behavior. They tend to have children who have only that one (or both) miscreant parent(s); and, thus, the children use their parental models to become poorly adjusted and just as bad.</p> <p>How do you remove this type of behavior from society, with utmost reliability? There are several ways. They all involve the death of the individual(s). By rifle squad, guillotine, electric chair, toxic injection, or other form of termination (punishment for their actions).</p> <p>Consequently, does this seem uncivil? Unjustified? Inhuman? NO!</p> <p>Consider the inhuman treatment that these thugs have inflicted upon their victims, mostly women, children, helpless beings, and innocent ones. Therefore, is that more acceptable than the death of these animals?</p> <p>Moreover, I believe most people who are first responders, whether law enforcement officers, fire personnel, EMTs, even nurses and doctors, would agree that a sudden loss of incurable lives is better than the loss of all of those victims.</p> <p>As a result, it seems that the only people who find it worthy to invest in these thugs are inexperienced individuals or attorneys who profit by defending them over and over in appeal after appeal.</p> <p>Finally, let’s stop the madness. Enforce or reinstate, if your state repealed the death penalty, the elimination of these reprobates.</p> <p>– Roger Bull, sergeant (ret.), Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, author</p></article>

This is Infowars we’re talking about, after all.</p> <p>On Monday, host Owen Shroyer claimed Michelle Obama is a transgender woman, formerly named Michael, and is <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/owen-shroyer-thinks-michelle-obama-is-a-transgender-woman-seeking-to-implement-a-demonic-culture/" type="external">part of a larger liberal plot to mainstream “literally a Satanic culture.”</a></p> <p>As Right Wing Watch reports:</p> <q> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R6mZKy2C50" type="external">Yesterday</a>, Shroyer discussed a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj457__hvjWAhUL7SYKHTyGAX0QqOcBCDYwAg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flosangeles.cbslocal.com%2F2017%2F10%2F16%2Fdraq-queen-library-lgtbq-kids%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2sZd5nx1DpTG7KpEDCNXzC" type="external">story</a> about a viral photo of drag queen who read books to children at the Michelle Obama Public Library in Long Beach, California, while wearing a costume that included horns and scary makeup. Shroyer asserted that the event happened at the library named after Michelle Obama because the former first lady is a transgender woman who used to be named “Michael.”</p> <p>“Why do you think Michelle Obama is having this at her library, folks? It’s transsexual, OK. That’s a man, or it was a man. No, it is a man. Michael Obama,” Shoryer said. “So Michael Obama, now Michelle Obama, hosts LGBTQ history month at her library because that’s the community that her and her husband are a part of.”</p> <p>Later in the broadcast, Shroyer said the book reading event was further evidence of Infowars’ broader theories about a liberal conspiracy to undermine American culture and replace it with a demonic culture.</p> <p>“They want to sexualize the children. They want to bring this demonized culture, like literally Satanic culture, into the mainstream, have it at public libraries, and just pass it off as normal, accepted, this is just the norm now,” Shroyer said.</p> </q> <p>Watch Shroyer, and his guest, Jack Posobiec, discuss the wicked plan. And get ready for more of these stories as we get closer and closer to Halloween.</p> <p>Boo!!!</p></article>

You chose to sell your soul to get a shot at the apple. For all who have joined the #MeToo movement while pulling in millions for film work and living lavish lifestyles while thousands of other young women were forced through those same doors of degradation, your protests sound a little hollow.</p> <p>Check the roles you have played, and what those roles did to further the falsehood that women are sex objects and are only viable if they are “hot.” Every show on HBO and now Netflix has the required soft-porn and dehumanizing-to-women scenes that validate it and put it on the level of “acceptable art.” All involved are congratulated and given little blocks of Lucite with inscriptions verifying that yes, indeed, they took part in the degradation of women. And it is all caught on film.</p> <p>[lz_ndn video=33408813]</p> <p>For decades the feminists have claimed that women are like men and have the same sexual drives and should have the right to satisfy those desires in the same way they have seen men do for years. They desired to embrace the worst elements of men while denying that which sets all women apart; they used to be worthy of the pedestals men would create for them.</p> <p>Just that concept alone was so disgusting for feminists that they moved to crash the pedestals, streak naked on campuses, burn bras, practice free love and ultimately protest to have the right to kill the offspring of those unions. Yippee, women. You “became” men. You insisted you be treated like men — and oh, that you were tough enough to take it. But if someone brushes against your backside, you cry.</p> <p><a type="internal">Related: Rose McGowan Slams Golden Globes’ All-Black Attire</a></p> <p>By now, declaring that all unwanted touching, comments, looks, or even gestures should be reason enough to burn all men at the stake, you have declared your feminist movement a complete and total disaster. You are not real feminists because you didn’t go into the director’s office prepared for what you knew was going to happen.</p> More from LifeZette <p>You wanted that position so badly, you would do anything — even pose nude in your hero’s porn mags. It was an honor that women would seek to be in the centerfold of Playboy. It was an icon of women power — or so you thought. It was men laughing all the way to the bedroom after they convinced women it would empower them.</p> <p>It’s like men yelling the loudest for the right of women to kill the product of their unprotected sex. No skin off the guy’s teeth. He’ll just jump in bed with another clueless bimbo who must have missed all the sex ed classes that started in kindergarten. And has anyone ever seen the books they use to teach kids about sex? Talk about dehumanizing and degrading.</p> <p>Why weren’t the mothers screaming about that? Oh, wait — they were. They were called prudes — and they were dismissed by the educational powers that be as obstacles to progress. They applauded then-President Bill Clinton for what he was doing with Monica Lewinsky — and declared that that sex act kept girls from becoming pregnant.</p> <p>Now that would be a legitimate #MeToo movement — all the young girls who were shamed by these classes, harassed by sexually active pubescents and made to feel abnormal if they joined abstinence groups and pledged to save themselves for marriage. They were mocked, ridiculed, shamed, and in some cases attacked and molested for their principled stance.</p> <p>If these feminists really do believe that sexual harassment should not be tolerated at any level, then let’s see them move to take all sex out of every movie and TV show. Suggest that no act of violence against a woman should ever be tolerated. That would pretty much cut the run time of any “Game of Thrones” episode in half. It’s the women with money and power in the industry who tolerate all this.</p> <p>Don’t just wear your sexy and revealing black dress, telling us you are so righteous on this issue — when most of you have committed the sin of allowing yourselves to be in a position for roles that show women in degrading or humiliating positions.</p> <p>Talk is cheap — and as a woman, I have fought my whole life to speak for myself and let men know these women do not, and have never, spoken for me. They have tried to silence women like me because we don’t embrace their flawed political ideals. We don’t swoon at their leftist and social views while they claim to care about the poor but live in gated communities to protect themselves from them.</p> <q> <p>As a woman, I have fought my whole life to speak for myself and let men know these women do not, and have never, spoken for me.</p> </q> <p>Oh, sure, they’ll let them in to clean their toilets or drive their cars or cut their grass. But they have nothing in common with the poor; and those who came through that economic strata do everything they can to separate themselves from it while pushing failed socialist agendas on them.</p> <p>These women are about groupthink, and the destruction of the individual. They will bully, with their magical pulpit, any who disagree or oppose them. They have great power and wield it effectively, which suggests that they always had the power to say no, to reject the job offer, to turn down the promotion or raise or to just say “buzz off” to any man who would say, “Yeah, that’s what I want to do to you.”</p> <p>Here’s another good #MeToo movement. How many women have been dismissed, marginalized, disrespected and/or abused because of their political stance, their faith, their political party? Oh, let’s see: There was Sarah Palin, Phyllis Schlafly, Stacey Dash, Beverly LaHaye, Paula Jones, Ann Coulter, Kathleen Wiley, Condi Rice, Juanita Broderick, Dana Loesch, Mia Love, Kellyanne Conway, and Sarah Sanders. Anyone see a pattern here at all?</p> <p>The #MeToo feminists embraced the women’s movement with glee knowing they were giving men more power over them — in so many ways. How many decades of Cosmo covers talked about women’s orgasms and the 10 billion ways to service or please a man? Seriously? These women can’t stand there pleading innocence and virtue when they were fanning the flames of sexual abuse. They started it — and now they want the rest of us to finish it while blaming all men for it.</p> <p>Here’s how you finish it, Hollywood: Stop making movies that show women nude or having sex or being abused or having their tops ripped off, or whatever. You know the movies. And women in black: Cover up your breasts, stop strutting in the long-slitted skirts, pull up the plunge lines, and look up the word “modest.”</p> <p>And men: There’s not much to say here — since men have only been doing what men have done since the beginning of time. The only difference is, the feminists gave them permission to do it.</p> <p>So in the words of Barack Obama: “Get off your high horses.”</p> <p>Nina May is a writer, producer and director, and currently the showrunner on “Daily Bread,” a faith-based post-apocalyptic drama.</p></article>

It all started when NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided to kneel on the sideline during the song.</p> <p>There were a lot of takes on both sides of the issue when it was fresh. Those who considered themselves patriots condemned Kaepernick’s behavior.</p> <p>Others agreed with Kaepernick, and argued that was not protesting America itself, but the killing of unarmed black men across the country at the hands of police. Still, many former and current military members found it extremely disrespectful, no matter what message Kaepernick was championing.</p> <p>The issue was so volatile that a lot of people think it cost Kaepernick a roster spot. His skill level may be higher than other backups across the league — the man played in a Super Bowl after all — but most owners don’t seem to want the extra media attention paid to a backup quarterback.</p> <p>TRENDING: <a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/l/ashleysexton/broke-mom-on-last-20-kids-pray-to-god-for-miracle-then-mom-finds-envelope-on-doorstep/" type="external">Broke Mom on Last $20, Kids Pray to God for Miracle. Then Finds Envelope with Check on Doorstep</a></p> <p>Just because Kapernick isn’t in the league doesn’t mean the issue is over. Protests have been erupting in St. Louis after an officer was found not guilty of first-degree murder.</p> <p>In Cahokia, Illinois, these protests prompted a team of 8-year-old football players to ask their coach about what was happening. When he asked the player why he thought people were protesting, the player responded by saying, “Because black people are getting killed and nobody’s going to jail.”</p> <p>This prompted Coach Orlando Gooden to talk about peaceful protests, specifically related to football. He told his kids about Colin Kaepernick, and they responded by saying, “Can we do that?”</p> <p>“I told them kneeling is a show of respect, not for those who broke boundaries — I support only peaceful protest — but for the innocent lives that have been touched by injustice,” Gooden told CBS. “I know some of the people talk and speak as if I told the kids to turn around and that. I didn’t.”</p> <p>So, at the next game, the team all took a knee when the national anthem started. The parents of the team seemed to be on board, but not everyone felt that way.</p> <p>Coach Gooden was hit with a wave of criticism from individuals and the media, saying that he was getting the children mixed up in something they didn’t fully understand. Brian Kilmeade of “Fox and Friends” even went so far as to say, “You’re never too young to disrespect the country.”</p> <p>“What I teach my kids is love, integrity, honesty, fairness, respect and boundaries,” Gooden said. “As long as I have support of my parents and team, I’m perfectly fine, and I’m covered under the First Amendment to peacefully protest and assemble.”</p> <p>All of this brings to mind a <a type="internal">story we covered last year</a>, about a high school team that travels with an American flag. Instead of kneeling, this team chose to bring the patriotism on the road with them.</p> <p>When the team came to a rival school, they noticed there was no flag hanging. They grabbed their road-flag off their bus, and brought it to the field for the national anthem.</p> <p>It was clear that this team understood the importance of patriotism, with one young man saying, “People die to protect their country and for the flag. People are disrespecting it all the time. It needs respect for the people who served the country and respect it.”</p> <p>We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

The 19-year-old had been looking for a gift for her dad and was commuting back on her bike when she stopped for a sip of water.</p> <p>Cops suddenly pulled over and confronted Hargrove, who they thought fit the description of an assailant who had reportedly been threatening people with a machete at a nearby store.

On the contrary, Tatyana was obviously younger, only stood 5-foot-2, and weighed 115 pounds.</p> <p>During the exchange, officers started using aggressive force toward Hargrove — punching her in the mouth and <a type="internal">enabling a K-9 to attack</a> and wound her leg.

Additionally, no weapon was found on her and another, fitting suspect was later arrested.</p> <p>Those same officers claimed it was mistaken identity, and yet, still charged Hargrove with “resisting … and aggravated assault on an officer.” Though the charges were dropped in August, Hargrove said the horrifying situation has made her “very paranoid.”</p> <p>At the time, the NAACP’s Facebook video interview with Hargrove sparked the story. Now, the teen’s lawyer plans to seek compensation for physical and emotional injuries as well as lost wages and medical bills.</p> <p>The story got back to Reddit users recently.

"It's a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered."</p> <p>Sources told Local 10 News there is great discontent among the victims, who remain disappointed at the way the U.S. government handled the situation. Their major complain is that it took too long for high ranking officials in Havana and Washington to take action.</p> <p>Over the weekend, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/23/politics/cuba-sonic-attack/index.html" type="external">CNN reported diplomats and their families have been attacked nearly 50 times</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, the same day this story was published, Cuban state-run media printed a report in which an unnamed high-ranking Cuban official said Cuba does not have the sort of equipment that can be used for this type of attack.</p> <p>The report adds Cuba doesn't have precedent with this type of attack.</p> <p>On Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, while addressing the United Nations, once again <a href="http://en.granma.cu/mundo/2017-09-22/cuba-will-never-accept-any-preconditions-or-impositions" type="external">denied responsibility and added the Cuban government complies with its obligations to protect all diplomats</a> on the island.</p> <p>"Cuba has never perpetrated, nor will it ever perpetrate, actions of this sort," Rodriguez said. "Cuba has never allowed, nor will it ever allow, its territory to be used by third parties with that purpose."</p> Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez speaks to the United Nations. <p>Rodriguez added results from a preliminary investigation being conducted at the highest level of his government, which includes U.S. supplied data, up to this point shows no evidence that confirms a cause or origin related to the health issues being reported by the American diplomats and their families.</p> <p>"The investigation to clarify this issue continues, and in order to be able to arrive to a conclusion, it will be crucial to count on the cooperation of the U.S. authorities," Rodriguez said. "It would be unfortunate if a matter of this nature is politicized."</p> <p>On Sept. 15, The Associated Press reported <a href="https://www.apnews.com/3feb224688ce42eb9491c94d19dcf3a3" type="external">Cuba's President Raul Castro was so rattled by what's happening</a>, he sent for the top American envoy in the country to address grave concerns about the attacks.</p> <p>The way Castro responded surprised Washington, several U.S. officials familiar with the exchange told The Associated Press.</p> <p>In a rare face-to-face conversation, Castro told U.S. diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis that he was equally baffled and concerned. Castro denied any responsibility.</p> <p>The Cubans have allowed several investigative agencies, including the FBI, to spend time on the communist-run island and seek out answers.</p> <p>In a country tightly controlled by the government, Americans investigators are still looking into whether a rogue faction in Cuba's security forces acted in defiance with the Castro government and possibly collaborated with another country, like Russia.</p> <p>On Aug. 23, Local 10 News was the first media outlet in the country to report that <a type="internal">there could be up to 19 victims</a>. Days later, the State Department confirmed those numbers and subsequently increased the number of victims to 21.</p> <p>Canadian diplomats have suffered similar health problems and believe they were victims of similar attacks.</p> <p>Back in August, Local 10 News also learned <a type="internal">some of the victims were treated at the University of Miami</a> by a doctor who specializes in ear and brain damage.</p> <p>There is a history of American diplomats being harassed while working in Havana, but never this severe.</p> <p>While living and working in Havana, some of these same victims of "sonic attacks" were constantly under overt surveillance. Their cars were vandalized, phones tapped, homes broken into, human waste left in toilets, their clothing soaked in urine and pets even poisoned.</p> <p>Copyright 2017 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.</p></article>
	<article id="0001009" published-at="2017-10-09" title="Charlie Sykes: Conservative Media Provides Trump Supporters a ‘Safe Space’ From the Truth"><p>Mediaite columnist John Ziegler spoke to Charlie Sykes this weekend, and the conservative former radio host offered some mocking commentary about people who sacrifice their credibility to always defend President Trump.</p> <p>During the 2016 election, Sykes was a vocal Never-Trump conservative who worried that Trump’s political rise would have dire long-term consequences for the GOP and the country at large. Sykes currently works as an MSNBC contributor, and he frequently criticizes <a type="internal">right-wing figures</a> <a type="internal">who display</a> <a type="internal">ideological hypocrisy</a> by dismissing the president’s controversies.</p> <p>Sykes was on to promote his new book – <a href="https://www.thecontrarianconservative.com/books/" type="external">How the Right Lost It’s Mind</a> – which explores how Trump came to embody the decline of traditional Republican thinking. The piece also considers how certain flaws within the conservative movement and made it possible for someone like Trump to ascend to the White House.</p> <q> <p>“I always knew there were the fringe characters, but I always believed the center would hold. I always believed we would ultimately do the rational, reasonable, principled thing, which was obviously, in retrospect, highly naïve.”</p> </q> <p>Ziegler and Sykes proceeded to discuss how conspiracy theorists and false demagoguery became mainstream viewpoints among the right. Skyes called this phenomenon a “cancer,” and he figured that Trump was able to normalize this and harness momentum by creating a campaign to mimic their rhetoric.</p> <p>As the conversation continued, Sykes said it has become “so evident” conservative talk radio is a media business designed to pursue ratings over any ideological cause. He argued that people like Rush Limbaugh followed the shifting views of their audience, while Fox’s Sean Hannity is “dumb as a box of rocks” and one of those who would predictably cave in to Trump.</p> <p>Eventually, Ziegler noted how often people tune out various media figures so they can pay attention to those who provide them with information that reinforces their worldview. Sykes agreed with Ziegler on this topic, and he compared the situation to conservatives who make fun of the idea of safe spaces.</p> <q> <p>“One of the things I realized was that the we conservatives have mocked the Left, I think legitimately, for safe spaces on university campuses. But the conservative audience really came to think of conservative talk radio, conservative media as their safe space, where they were not going to be confronted with the inconvenient truths, where they weren’t going to have to eat the broccoli. And anyone who fed them the broccoli, anyone who told them things that were disturbing or off message, got a lot of pushback.”</p> </q> <p>Sykes went on to lament that there were no more ideological standards or cultural footholds conservatives could rely on after falling in line behind Trump. He continued to express concerns that the current toxic political atmosphere will have negative repercussions around the country</p> <p>Listen above, via Free Speech Broadcasting.</p> <p>[Image via screengrab]</p> <p>— —</p> <p>&amp;gt;&amp;gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/KenMeyer91" type="external">Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter</a></p> <p>Have a tip we should know? <a href="mailto:tips@mediaite.com" type="external">tips@mediaite.com</a></p></article>

Do Better!’"><p>share link</p> Visit TODAY.com for the latest news, videos, easy recipes, inspiring stories and more. <p>Earlier this week, actress Rose McGowan <a type="internal">was temporarily suspended</a>from Twitter after she unleashed a series of tweets about the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The suspension came after <a type="internal">she called out Ben Affleck and others</a> for providing cover for Weinstein’s sexual misconduct. The social media platform stated that McGowan was suspended for violating its rule of publicly sharing personal phone numbers.</p> <p>Considering McGowan — who has accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her — is one of the leading voices bringing the movie producer’s history of sexual misconduct to light, the suspension was a PR disaster for Twitter, to say the least. During today’s broadcast of Megyn Kelly Today, host Megyn Kelly lit into Twitter over its decision while pointing to her own history of being harassed online as proof the platform is inconsistent in applying its rules.</p> <p>Highlighting that it is against the site’s rules to share phone numbers, Kelly noted that it also violates Twitter’s policy to incite harassment or to directly threaten people, jokingly asking the audience if they knew someone who did that in an obvious nod to the president. Kelly then flashed back to the election when she was targeted by Trump fans after her tough questioning of Donald Trump at a debate. This included Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen encouraging others to “gut” her.</p> <p>“And I remember Twitter rushing to enforce its rules — no,” Kelly observed. “No, I don’t.”</p> <p>She continued, “The point is not to re-dredge up that old dispute. It’s to say there’s an inconsistency here and who is Twitter kidding. Give me a break! Twitter, do better!

Last summer, Oppenheim said the network made the decision to pull the plug. But Farrow wanted to keep chasing it, so he continued the project for The New Yorker, where he eventually published his findings on Tuesday.</p> <p>“The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us,” Oppenheim said.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a type="internal">Farrow told Rachel Maddow that he disagreed</a> with the multiple assessments at NBC that the story was not reportable.</p> <p>“I walked into the door at The New Yorker with an explosive reportable piece that should have been public earlier and immediately obviously The New Yorker recognized that and it is not accurate to say that it was not reportable,” Farrow said. “In fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC.”</p> <p>What remains unclear from the Oppenheim statement is why Farrow had to be taken off of the story during the summer. Was there another time-sensitive project that NBC needed him on? If they had invested “many, many months” on the Weinstein project, why completely take him off a story that he only planned to pursue elsewhere anyway? Questions certainly remain.</p> <p>[image via Shutterstock.com]</p> <p>——</p> <p>Follow Joe DePaolo (@ <a href="http://twitter.com/joe_depaolo" type="external">joe_depaolo</a>) on Twitter</p> <p>Have a tip we should know? <a href="mailto:tips@mediaite.com" type="external">tips@mediaite.com</a></p></article>

	<article id="0001015" published-at="2017-10-04" title="Gun Control Advocates Cannot Win Without Fighting Their Own Racism [OPINION]"><p>On Sunday (October 1), a 64-year-old White man named Stephen Paddock opened fire from a Las Vegas hotel room window, shooting into the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival and later killing himself. With <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/las-vegas-gunmans-girlfriend-arrives-back-in-us-is-met-by-fbi/" type="external">at least 59 people killed and 527 wounded</a> as of press time, this mass shooting surpasses the 2016 <a type="internal">Pulse</a> nightclub massacre as the country’s deadliest shooting by a single triggerman.</p> <p>Just like Pulse and other mass shootings before it, the aftermath of this tragedy is following a <a type="internal">time-honored template</a>: Law enforcement rushes to confirm or reject the assailant as a “ <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/las-vegas-shooting-terrorism-terrorist-675476" type="external">terrorist</a>” (read: Muslim, Brown-skinned). The Islamic State plays on our <a href="http://colorlines.com/tags/islamophobia" type="external">Islamophobia</a> by claiming <a href="http://www.theroot.com/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-las-vegas-mass-1819076494" type="external">dubious responsibility</a>.</p> <p>Mainstream media outlets follow every new development, treating each revelation about the shooter’s <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/us/las-vegas-shooting-investigation/index.html" type="external">weapons stash</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/las-vegas-shooting-live-updates.html" type="external">motive</a> and <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/10/02/stephen-paddock-las-vegas-gunman/" type="external">music preferences</a> with the same unrelenting morbid curiosity. Their headlines blast all-caps superlatives like “WORST” and “DEADLIEST” with zero context. The thousands of Native and African Americans that White people slaughtered in <a type="internal">Tulsa</a>, <a href="http://www.history.com/news/remembering-the-wounded-knee-massacre" type="external">Wounded Knee</a> and countless other places don’t even register in their majority-White panel discussions. Moreover, their coverage unfailingly grants White shooters a narrative complexity (Was he a loner? What was his childhood like?) in death that they <a type="internal">never give</a> Black victims of police violence or the people who loved them (Did she provoke the officer? Why wouldn’t she just comply? Why did her second cousin steal that candy bar 10 years ago?).</p> <p>Of course, politicians of all leanings send their “ <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/news/pray-for-vegas-tributes-are-raising-awareness-support/2085209" type="external">thoughts and prayers</a>” to the victims, calling on the same higher power many conveniently forget when <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-nra-money-20171003-story.html" type="external">taking gun lobby money</a>. And don’t forget the rush to pathologize White shooters. This time around, President Donald Trump is <a href="https://apnews.com/6a73df6e3c1848d7aafcbcd2689ab16c" type="external">alleging</a> that the shooter suffered from mental illness, and outlets are <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/las-vegas-strip-shooter-prescribed-anti-anxiety-drug-in-june/" type="external">reporting</a> that he was on anti-anxiety medication that could have caused him to act aggressively.</p> <p>If your social media feeds look anything like mine, this Groundhog Day of a post-massacre cycle includes one other crucial aspect: critics, often liberal ones, who demand their legislators fight the National Rifle Association’s ( <a type="internal">NRA</a>) lobbying power and impose gun control measures. They say things like, “We need action, not prayers,” and “I don’t get why anybody owns a gun.”</p> <p>These arguments don’t endear the critics to Second Amendment groups and supporters who use deliberate and racist <a type="internal">fearmongering</a> to justify legalized assault rifles. But more importantly, they conceal the far more insidious racism lurking within their own beliefs. They say that gun control makes us safer <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/09/gun-control-mass-incarceration-drug-war-nra-shooters" type="external">without acknowledging</a> why Black gun ownership rates <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/us/african-american-gun-club-trump/index.html" type="external">grew over the past five years, especially</a> after the election of Donald Trump. And their push for a nation without guns will fail, as it always does, unless they address two dangerous blind spots:</p> <p>Most gun control measures rely on law enforcement that people of color rightfully don’t trust. MC and political activist Michael “ <a href="http://colorlines.com/tags/killer-mike" type="external">Killer Mike</a>” Render once <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-and-killer-mike-spar-on-owning-assault-weapons" type="external">defended</a> the Second Amendment by saying, “I represent a group of people who are being killed by the people who their tax money pays.”</p> <p>Mike certainly doesn’t represent all left-leaning Black activists, but his statement addresses something that too many gun control advocates ignore. While gun-toting White racists <a type="internal">threaten</a> communities of color with an <a type="internal">unyielding</a> <a type="internal">frequency</a>, one of the biggest daily threats—particularly for <a type="internal">African and Native Americans</a>—comes from law enforcement. That threat existed when early U.S. municipalities first created police departments <a href="http://time.com/4779112/police-history-origins/" type="external">to recapture the enslaved</a>, and it continues today, when they are killed at disproportionately high rates.</p> <p>Most contemporary gun control legislation doesn’t stop police departments of all sizes from <a type="internal">arming themselves to the teeth</a>, greeting Black protesters with <a type="internal">military-grade weapons and tactics</a>, calling on the actual military to <a type="internal">suppress pushback</a> to their policing or <a type="internal">appropriating activist chants</a> while violently claiming public spaces for themselves.</p> <p>It does, however, allow these agencies explicit authority to enforce who can have what guns. Last year, it relied on terror watch lists that <a href="http://gawker.com/the-democrats-are-boldly-fighting-for-a-bad-stupid-bil-1782449026" type="external">target people of color</a> to determine that ownership.</p> <p>We cannot tell communities of color to trust law enforcement agencies—who <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/27/us/man-arrested-gun-charlottesville-rally/index.html" type="external">don’t intervene</a> when White supremacists fire into crowds or <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/dylann-roof-burger-king-cops-meal-article-1.2267615" type="external">take racists to Burger King</a> after arresting them for killing Black churchgoers—to protect them from mass shooters. They already have and <a type="internal">exercise</a> the means to kill people of color en masse.</p> <p>Gun control measures did work—just not against White shooters. The NRA’s current pro-Second Amendment stance contrasts with its previous <a href="http://time.com/4431356/nra-gun-control-history/" type="external">support</a> for gun control measures. The group successfully lobbied for both California’s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_capitolmarch.html" type="external">Mulford Act of 1967</a> and its federal successor, the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/rules-and-regulations/gun-control-act" type="external">Gun Control Act of 1968</a>. So it’s clear that the NRA can understand why certain people shouldn’t access assault rifles, machine guns or other mass murder-primed arms.</p> <p>But to the NRA, “certain people” originally meant Black activists. The Mulford Act came barely two months after <a type="internal">Black Panther Party</a> members staged an open-carry demonstration at the California state capitol. The legislation repealed part of the state’s <a href="http://www.oclaw.org/research/code/ca/PEN/12031./content.html#.WdP0VRIrK1s" type="external">Penal Code 12031</a>, which allowed people to carry loaded weapons—as the Panthers did while patrolling Black neighborhoods to ward off police abuse—as long as they were in the open. The Panthers still believed in guns, but without the law’s protection, other armed groups—like the <a type="internal">Los Angeles Police Department</a>—had legal authority to shoot up Party headquarters.</p> <p>Repression like what the Panthers faced dates back to the antebellum period, when <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2900230/the-really-really-racist-history-of-gun-control-in-america/" type="external">state laws</a> prohibited people who were enslaved from even touching guns without a White supervisor. Free African Americans who owned guns risked seizure and violent punishment by White so-called “ <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SFNdYJyfIqkC&amp;pg=PA403&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cshall+enter+into+all+Negro+houses+and+suspected+places,+and+search+for+arms+and+other+offensive+or+improper+weapons,+and+may+lawfully+seize+and+take+away+such+arms,+weapons,+and+ammunition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PVMyn-3jAv&amp;sig=94zuWM0Kzqb7Wr8web-JE9YAH3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4i9Hmwc7NAhXC_R4KHRLBBCEQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cshall%20enter%20into%20all%20Negro%20houses%20and%20suspected%20places%2C%20and%20search%20for%20arms%20and%20other%20offensive%20or%20improper%20weapons%2C%20and%20may%20lawfully%20seize%20and%20take%20away%20such%20arms%2C%20weapons%2C%20and%20ammunition&amp;f=false" type="external">citizen patrols</a>.” The end of the Civil War brought no relief as White supremacist governments enacted <a href="https://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/recon/code.html" type="external">Black codes</a> that effectively outlawed Black gun ownership.</p> <p>Founded in 1871, the NRA did not participate in these gun ownership debates for much of its early history. That changed in 1926, when NRA president Karl Fredrick responded to perceptions of gun violence in immigrant communities by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1066866" type="external">drafting legislation</a> to restrict concealed carry practices. The organization then embarked on a gun control mission that <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/112322/gun-control-racist" type="external">primarily impacted</a> people of color (including immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, who had yet to be deemed “White”).</p> <p>Thirty years later, the NRA was silent when the state of Alabama <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2014/01/21/what-gun-advocates-get-wrong-about-dr-martin-lu/197665" type="external">denied</a> <a type="internal">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</a> a concealed carry permit after his house was firebombed. Decades later, the NRA is true to form, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/06/18/some-gun-owners-are-disturbed-by-the-philando-castile-verdict-the-nra-is-silent/?utm_term=.f6f9833d4971" type="external">saying nothing</a> when Black legal gunowners like <a type="internal">Philando Castile</a> are shot dead by police. Instead, it chooses to <a type="internal">demonize unarmed activists</a> who are fighting for equity as the real threat.</p> <p>Gun control in America won’t work for all Americans unless advocates push to demilitarize police departments and advance measures that don’t disproportionately impact people of color. Gun control reform that does not go this route will end in laws that further empower police to seize weapons and use them against whomever they choose. History shows who they’ll target first.</p></article>

It's the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, with the gunman firing from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel into a music festival on the ground. According to reports, that <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/10/stephen-paddock-gun-what-kind-how-many-weapons-legal/" type="external">a "cache of weapons," including 10 rifles, was found in the shooter's room</a> after the attack.</p> <p>Knowing that, people may wonder <a type="internal">why aren't fully automatic guns illegal</a>?

In addition, gun-owners in the state may carry weapons openly without a permit and can also get a license to carry concealed. Guns with high-capacity magazines are allowed.</p> <p>CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano told the outlet in the aforementioned article just how much damage weapons like that can do.</p> <q>
 Automatic weapon(s) like that — had to be numbers of magazines or a very large drum, it sounded to me like a belt-fed weapon, a military-style weapon and then to be shooting down, to use the analogy, it was like shooting fish in a barrel in that space. </q> <p>With such a horrific metaphor as that, it's hard to understand why fully automatic weapons, capable of so much damage, aren't illegal; the reason why is filled with so many loopholes that stop people from being safe if the weapon is in the wrong hands.</p> <p>According to Daily Kos, <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/10/2/1703311/-Fully-automatic-weapons-aren-t-illegal-and-there-are-thousands-around-Las-Vegas" type="external">it's not illegal for people to own military grade machine guns</a> or other fully automatic guns, but "ownership of these weapons is restricted." But here "restricted" is not as much as you may think: While most average people are seemingly limited from their ability to own these weapons, there are numerous loopholes. Citizens, gun dealers, and gun ranges cannot buy new machine guns, but those purchased prior to 1986 still exist and are traded around — in fact, as Daily Kos reported, "There's about one machine gun for every 1,000 Americans."</p> <p>As is often the case after a gun-related tragedy like this, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/senate-democrats-congress-needs-to-get-off-its-ass-on-gun-control-after-las-vegas-shooting/article/2636247" type="external">gun control becomes a hot topic</a>. Those against laws that allow open carry, machine gun ownership, and unlicensed firearm owning are quick to speak up that events like these show that the country needs more gun control laws. Those on the opposite side, those who are vocal about the right to bear arms, will loudly disagree. It's the same every time, and there are entirely too many tragedies like this one that spark this kind of debate — all the while nothing changes.</p> <p>As the situation in Las Vegas is an ongoing investigation, it isn't fully known why the shooter committed this act, or how many weapons and what type were used, nor who owned them and whether it was legally or not. All of that will be discovered in time, and it's best to not rush to judgement about whether Nevada's lax gun laws are to blame.</p> <p>Still, the bottom line is that this event did start up the conversation once more, and also drew attention to the permissive laws on the books in Nevada. Perhaps this attention will push lawmakers to change things for the future. Or, maybe things will stay exactly the same.</p> <p>But, as tiresome as this conversation can be — as it's been had so many times — it's an important one, and it will likely wage on in the days and weeks to come. Only time will tell if anything changes this time.</p> <p>Here are some ways you can help the <a type="internal">victims in Las Vegas</a>.</p></article>
	<article id="0001018" published-at="2017-10-10" title="Hillary: “Shocked and appalled” by Weinstein … now"><p>Five days after the New York Times <a type="internal">exposed Harvey Weinstein’s predatory behavior</a>, Hillary Clinton is finally all over it. In a statement released just thirty minutes ago, Hillary proclaims herself “shocked and appalled” by claims pouring out from multiple media outlets about Weinstein’s <a type="internal">decades-long sexual harassmen</a>t <a type="internal">and worse</a>. Notably, she says nothing about the hundreds of thousands of dollars Weinstein raised for her and Bill and the Democratic Party over the last quarter-century:</p> <q> <p>JUST IN: Hillary Clinton releases statement on Harvey Weinstein allegations <a href="https://t.co/evarlP4q9B" type="external">pic.twitter.com/evarlP4q9B</a></p> <p>— NBC News (@NBCNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/917804755434524673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">October 10, 2017</a></p> </q> <p>Funny, Hillary Clinton <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-links-climate-change-recent-wildfires-hurricanes/story?id=50385107&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn" type="external">spoke last night at UC Davis</a> for an hour and a half, and didn’t see fit to remark on her status as “shocked and appalled” at all. The candidate who lost to Donald Trump in last year’s presidential race complained about his climate-change policies, blamed a recent spate of hurricanes and wildfires on global warming, promoted protests by NFL players during the national anthem, and promoted her book What Happened. What didn’t happen was Hillary mentioning her Hollywood pal and fundraiser Harvey Weinstein, despite having run on a platform of lifting up women and protecting them from the Harvey Weinsteins of the world.</p> <p>At least her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), has decided to declare Weinstein’s actions as “low-life behavior.” <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/10/10/tim-kaine-weinstein-leaders-condemn-sot-newday.cnn" type="external">CNN’s Alisyn Camerota wonders</a> when anyone will hear that from Hillary. Kaine dodged at first by saying he’s a Senator, not a press secretary, and then suggested that Hillary would get around to it in her own time. Eventually. <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/media/354670-kaine-to-cnn-hillary-will-speak-on-weinstein-when-the-time-is-right" type="external">Maybe</a>:</p> <q> <p>“Hillary Clinton spoke for 90 minutes last night in California. But she didn’t mention Harvey Weinstein,” noted “New Day” co-anchor Alisyn Camerota. “Why not?”</p> <p>“Look, you know, Alisyn, I’m nobody’s press secretary. I’m a U.S. senator and I’m telling you that sexual harassment is unacceptable. And I really think it’s low-life behavior,” Kaine said.</p> <p>“Hillary Clinton speaks out against sexual harassment often. And I’m sure she’ll have a word to say when the time is right for her. But I don’t — you know, I’m not — I’m not anybody’s press secretary,” he added.</p> </q> <p>In case you were wondering, Kaine’s not a press secretary. But then again, Kaine says any leader should be out front in condemning Weinstein’s behavior:</p> <q> <p>“But you would recommend that she do that,” Camerota followed.</p> <p>“Any leader, any leader should condemn this,” Kaine replied. “I mean, I have a 22-year-old daughter who is starting off, you know, in the work world. And I — when you read the stories about young women feeling pressured by somebody in a position of power, it makes you sick.”</p> </q> <p>That only amplifies Camerota’s point. Hillary had a 90-minute platform last night at UC Davis, hardly a bastion of counter-progressive thought. She couldn’t spare a single moment to say something like, “Hey, that Harvey Weinstein really turned out to be a pig, eh?” Nothing? So much for being a leader on women’s issues.</p> <p>Not that Hillary was alone in her silence, at least up to now. Hollywood had mostly kept its mouth shut, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/harvey-weinstein-bombshell-will-hollywood-stars-finally-condemn-their-kingmaker" type="external">especially its male stars</a>, but George Clooney was the early exception to that rule, to his credit. In <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/george-clooney-speaks-out-on-harvey-weinstein-its-disturbing-on-a-whole-lot-of-levels?via=twitter_page" type="external">an interview with The Daily Beast’s Marlow Stern</a>, Clooney says that he doubts that Democratic politicians knew much about Weinstein’s activities; Clooney himself was only aware of rumors of womanizing, not abuse. Calling Weinstein “indefensible,” Clooney called on Democrats to return all of their Weinstein money pronto:</p> <q> <p>“It’s indefensible. That’s the only word you can start with,” he says. “Harvey’s admitted to it, and it’s indefensible. I’ve known Harvey for 20 years. He gave me my first big break as an actor in films on From Dusk Till Dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. We’ve had dinners, we’ve been on location together, we’ve had arguments. But I can tell you that I’ve never seen any of this behavior—ever.” …</p> <p>This is an interesting moment. I’ve seen a lot of people, from Meryl [Streep] to Judi Dench, come out and say “holy shit,” and I think that that’s been the reaction by a lot of people in Hollywood. I don’t think that people were looking the other way; I think that people weren’t looking, because in some ways, a lecherous guy with money picking up younger girls is unfortunately not a news story in our society.</p> </q> <p>That’s … not entirely true, at least apart from Clooney himself. He seems to be pretty honest about his own perspective, but Jessica Chastain tweeted out yesterday that “the stories were everywhere” about Weinstein, and that she was warned about interacting with him at all:</p> <q> <p>I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an enviornment for it to happen again.</p> <p>— Jessica Chastain (@jes_chastain) <a href="https://twitter.com/jes_chastain/status/917504541708443650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">October 9, 2017</a></p> </q> <p>When confronted about why Chastain didn’t blow the whistle herself, the answer didn’t impress her followers:</p> <q> <p>We hear this same story. Someone could have said something, but didn't bc reasons. Try 2 be as brave IRL as u are in the movies.</p> <p>— Chica'sBailBonds (@irinamoises) <a href="https://twitter.com/irinamoises/status/917622735521464320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">October 10, 2017</a></p> </q> <p>It looks like more of a case of not wanting to know for Clooney and others. Some other male stars have come forward today, including Ben Affleck, to denounce Weinstein but still claiming that they knew nothing. (Gwyneth Paltrow today hailed Brad Pitt for defending her from Weinstein two decades ago, but failed to note that it means Pitt knew and said nothing.) Clooney wants the DNC to cough up the cash now that everyone knows:</p> <q> <p>So when you find out how much worse it is than you thought, then it’s a news story. And this is a big news story now. And I feel very bad for all of the victims. I mean, cornering a young anchorwoman in the kitchen and jerking off into a potted plant? That’s not just some rumor about Harvey hitting on a woman; it’s disturbing on a whole lot of levels, because there had to be a lot of people involved in covering that up. That’s frustrating. If politicians knew these stories, I doubt they’d have been taking donations from him at the DNC [Democratic National Committee], and I hope that they will all give the money back or donate it to good causes.</p> </q> <p>Well, they are donating to what they see as good causes. Primarily, that means other organizations that <a href="http://elections.ap.org/content/some-democrats-returning-money-they-received-weinstein" type="external">work to elect Democrats</a>:</p> <q> <p>Other major beneficiaries of the Weinstein family’s largesse included almost $200,000 to the party’s Senate campaign accounts, $23,200 to its House campaign arm senatorial and $46,350 to Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential candidate, and to HILLPAC, a committee Clinton used to support other Democrats while senator. The figures include contributions attributed to Weinstein, first wife Eve Chilton and current spouse Georgina Chapman. …</p> <p>The biggest beneficiary of funds from Weinstein and his family was the Democratic National Committee, which received about $800,000 in several of its accounts, according to the center, which analyzes political spending.</p> <p>Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the party plans to give more than $30,000 to Emily’s List, Emerge America and Higher Heights. All three groups work to elect women to office. Hinojosa said the amount was for the funds Weinstein himself donated to the party during the 2016 campaign.</p> </q> <p>That’s not donating as much as it is money laundering. But at least they’re acknowledging their connections to Weinstein. The Leader of All Women couldn’t manage even that much, until media outlets began openly reporting her deafening silence.</p></article>

Gibson has strongly condemned white supremacists, both in general and by name, and most of the speakers at his rallies are usually African-America, Latino, or Asian. One who was scheduled to speak at a rally in San Francisco last Saturday is transgender.</p> <p>Gibson has also said he rejects anti-Muslim Islamophobia. He supports robust free speech, and constantly challenges the Antifa activists to debate him.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the Anti-Defamation League, as well as various media, go on to paint Gibson and Patriot Prayer as "Alt-Right," "Alt-Lite," or "Far-Right," while denying they are racists, using nebulous terms with the common characteristic that the ralliers are generally Trump supporters.</p> <p>After Gibson had cancelled the Patriot Prayer rally on Saturday, he posted on the group's Facebook that he would be on the streets of Berkeley on Sunday seeking to conduct a dialogue with "normal people." Gibson has described his mission as an effort to "unite moderates," rejecting "extremists" of both the left and the right, and to restore civility and "respect" in political dialogue.</p> <p>When Patriot Prayer announced it's rally in San Francisco earlier this month, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Minority Leader and a former Speaker of the House, put out a press release which branded Gibson and Patriot Prayer as "white supremacists." Media coverage ensued repeating the description.</p> <p>Antifa is the self-styled "anti-fascist" group organized by the umbrella organization <a href="https://refusefascism.org/" type="external">Refuse Fascism</a>. Antifa activists had already expressed a desire to kill Gibson, who denounces Marxist ideology as well as Nazism and fascism. On Sunday, Antifa hunted Gibson on the streets of Berkeley.</p> <p>Gibson was reported to have been arrested in Berkeley, but the Patriot Prayer Facebook reports this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PatriotPrayerUSA/posts/1283926445063613" type="external">is not true</a>. Gibson was handcuffed briefly when he charged through police lines to escape an Antifa mob but was then released.</p> <p>A review of Gibson's publicly posted videos and speeches confirms that he has never been known to make a racist or white supremacist statement, and in fact spends quite a bit of time, as a Japanese-American, denouncing these very ideologies. Nevertheless, the group Antifa, in its literature and public record, makes no distinction between "fascists," "white supremacists," "Nazis," "Alt-Right," "Far-Right," and Trump supporters.</p> Antifa poster equating all Trump supporters with World War II Nazis. <p>A similar <a href="https://soapboxie.com/social-issues/So-Where-Were-the-Neo-Nazis-in-Boston" type="external">conservative-leaning rally in Boston</a> last week opened with a moment of silence for Heather Heyer, the woman killed in Charlottesville last month by a white supremacist. Many participants in the Boston conservative rally were not white, including the keynote speaker, Republican candidate for US Senate Dr. <a href="https://shiva4senate.com/" type="external">Shiva Ayyadurai</a>. As the candidate spoke, supporters held up his campaign signs, which read "Black Lives Matter" and "No to GMO."</p> <p>Nevertheless, the Boston local media reported the gathering as one of white supremacists, spurring a massive counter-protest of 40,000 people, including Antifa activists who caused the rally to be shut down early. A massive police presence was deployed in Boston to protect the conservative ralliers from harm.</p> Boston pro-Trump rally. Boston pro-Trump rally <p>With even the LA Times declining to call Patriot Prayer "white supremacists" or adherents of any other racist ideology, the only label which stuck was that they were Trump supporters.</p> <p>Only one of the scheduled speakers in Gibson's cancelled Saturday rally was white.

Yet he also doubled down on his defense of Confederate monuments, claiming that “they” are trying to “take away our heritage and our history.” (Emphasis added.)</p> <p>All of this appeared to signal a growing contempt for the rule of law and an increasing indifference to the health of our democracy and institutions, and to his own responsibilities and duty to the public to try to calm the antagonisms unleashed in Charlottesville’s aftermath.

President Donald Trump hosts Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari at the White House - DC NRA 5-1-18 <p>Trump is fine with forcing people to lay down their guns when it's about his safety.</p> <p>For people who insists guns make everyone safer, Trump and the NRA don’t seem to have any problem that <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-reg-nra-convention-pence-gun-ban-20180430-story.html" type="external">firearms are banned</a> when Trump <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/dallas/article210120154.html" type="external">speaks</a> at the radical gun group’s annual convention on Friday.</p> <p>The hypocrisy comes after Trump teamed up with the NRA in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, gun massacre, and announced that <a type="internal">flooding American schools</a> with armed teachers is the best way to keep students safe.</p> <p>The doomed policy plays off the NRA myth that we’re all safer the more people are armed in America.</p> <p>But for some reason that’s not put into practice at the NRA convention when Trump’s in town.</p> <p>NRA members who want to attend Trump’s speech, or Mike Pence’s NRA speech this week, will be forced to leave their guns outside of Houston’s Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center.</p> <p>That’s because the Secret Service <a href="https://www.etix.com/ticket/p/8137229/nraila-leadership-forum-dallas-nra-annual-meetings-and-exhibits?country=US&amp;language=en" type="external">will be in charge</a> of the protection, and the Secret Service, obviously, doesn’t allow armed individuals to be around the president or other people it’s charged with protecting.</p> <p>The Secret Service, in effect, categorically rejects the NRA rhetoric that more guns equals more safety.</p> <p>The hypocrisy <a type="internal">here is rather stunning</a> — America needs to fill its schools with guns in order to protect students, but it makes total sense nobody with a gun is allowed to be in same room as President of the United States.</p> <p>The NRA this week tries to hide behind the Secret Service in order to escape claims of duplicity. But if the NRA were true to its values, wouldn’t it be demanding that guns be allowed into Trump and Pence speeches? And if not, why doesn’t the group withdraw its invitation?</p> <p>Why is okay for the President of the United States to expect the safety of a gun-free environment when the NRA remains thoroughly committed to making sure Americans are confronted with gun-carrying citizens at grocery stores, gas stations, churches, and schools across the country?</p> <p>NRA loud mouths like Dana Loesch preach to <a type="internal">their choir</a> that’s there’s a culture war on guns and the government is trying to strip them of their rights. Yet the NRA’s okay with members being forced to lay down their firearms for Pence and Trump speeches.</p> <p>So much for good guys with guns. (And Trump <a type="internal">still won’t honor</a> James Shaw Jr., a good guy from a recent mass shooting.)</p> <p>Trump’s hypocrisy is blatant too. Why doesn’t he use his Twitter platform to publicly rail against protocols that ban guns at his events? Why doesn’t he categorically insists that when he address a crowd that it must be fill with firearms?</p> <p>After all, if schools would allegedly be safer with lots of educators walking around with guns, that same logic should hold true for Trump events.</p> <p>Also, remember that Trump has publicly bragged that if faced with a shooting, he’d be the first one to spring into action and <a type="internal">run towards the gun fire</a>.</p> <p>But forget all that because Trump’s cool with guns being banned at his NRA speech.</p></article>
	<article id="0001023" published-at="2017-10-09" title="Nepal Police Arrest Seven Bitcoin Traders Despite Lack of Regulation"><a href="https://nulltx.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_274763711.jpg" type="external"/> TheMerkle Nepal Arrests Bitcoin Traders <p>Very few countries around the world effectively prohibit people from using Bitcoin. That doesn’t mean police can’t and don’t arrest individuals for their involvement in Bitcoin, though. In Nepal, at least seven people were arrested for being involved in cryptocurrency trading operations. It seems these trades were executed “without authorization”. That’s a strange explanation, considering Nepal doesn’t have any active cryptocurrency regulation whatsoever.</p> Nepal Arrests Raise a lot of Questions <p>Being arrested while doing something that is not considered to be illegal will always raise more questions than answers. This is especially true when the activity being performed involves Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. As of right now, <a type="internal">Nepal</a> does not have any official regulation prohibiting the use or trading of cryptocurrencies. However, local law enforcement certainly feels otherwise, as they arrested seven individuals for their cryptocurrency trading activities this week.</p> <p>This certainly begs the question as to why these people were arrested in the first place. According to a local source which contacted us by email, the arrests were made due to trading bitcoins “without authorization”. That is a rather interesting point of view put forth by the Central Investigation Bureau, as consumers in Nepal can’t ask anyone for permission when it comes to dealing with cryptocurrencies whatsoever. Nor should anyone need to do so in the first place.</p> <p>While it is true a communist government won’t take kindly toward cryptocurrencies, arresting people without a valid reason won’t go over too well either. Regulatory guidelines are currently being worked out by the Nepalese government, but until those are in place, people are still free to do as they like. Or that is how it should be, at least, even though a communist government may have a very different opinion on these matters.</p> <p>Local press reports <a href="http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-10-06/7-nabbed-for-running-bitcoin-exchange-business.html" type="external">indicate</a> that the suspects were arrested in Kathmandu and Chitwan. They are all still in police custody as we speak, but no further information has been revealed as of yet. All of this raises even more questions as to why these people were arrested in the first place. No currency amounts have been specified either, which only adds more fuel to this mystery investigation. It is evident that all suspects face jail time, although the grounds on which such a verdict would be determined remain unclear.</p> <p>More broadly, it seems things are going from bad to worse in Nepal for Bitcoin users and companies as we speak. The impending regulation will assuredly introduce some changes over the next few months. It is certainly possible the government will crack down on cryptocurrencies as a whole and prohibit this new form of money from being traded altogether. Bitsewa, one of the few exchanges based in the country, has already shut down this week. The Nepalese version of LocalBitcoins isn’t all that popular either, which is somewhat surprising.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how the cryptocurrency sector develops in Nepal. Although this is not a major cryptocurrency hub by any stretch of the imagination, any form of regulation could set a dangerous precedent and stifle innovation. Whether or not Bitcoin will be banned altogether remains anybody’s guess for the time being. There are a lot of questions and very few answers right now; that much is certain.</p></article>

Maulana L. Sadiq Qasmi of Darul Uloom Deoband in India. PHOTO COURTESY: DNA <p>The Darul Uloom Deoband in India issued a fatwa on Saturday banning women from plucking, trimming and shaping their eyebrows and also cutting their hair.</p> <p>Darul Iftaa, which issues the Darul Uloom Deoband’s edicts, termed the act as “un-Islamic”.</p> <p>A Muslim man from Saharanpur had asked Daul Iftaa on Islamic laws about eyebrow trimming and hair-cutting. “Do Islamic laws allow my wife to go for eyebrow plucking and hair-cutting?” the man asked Darul Iftaa.</p> <p>In response to his query, the Darul Iftaa issued a fatwa saying that both the acts were ‘un-Islamic’ and banned under Islamic laws. “If a Muslim woman is involved in such acts then she is violating Islamic laws,” read the fatwa in Urdu.</p> <p><a type="internal">Saudi cleric claims Earth is stationary, does not revolve around Sun</a></p> <p>Darul Iftaa clarified that there are 10 acts, including eyebrow plucking and hair-cutting which were banned for Muslim women under Islam. “Hair adds to the beauty of Muslim women and they should never get them cut, pointed the fatwa. Issuing the fatwa, Darul Iftaa head Maulana L. Sadiq Qasmi said, “Muslim women should stay away from beauty parlours as Islam does not permit them to have make-up that attracts other male members.”</p> <p>He added that Muslim men too were not allowed to shave under Islam, trim eyebrows, wear make-up etc is.</p> <p>“The trend of Muslim women going to beauty parlours has increased in the country. It is not a good sign and it should be stopped immediately. We should have issued a fatwa in this regard long ago,” he maintained.</p> <p>Three years ago, the Darul Iftaa in London had conducted a detailed study on the contentious issue taking into account all schools of Islamic thought including Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi and Hanbali.</p> <p>It also imposed a similar ban with an exception that Muslim women – married or unmarried – were allowed to remove facial hair if they develop moustache, beard or unwanted hair with permission from the husband or other male members.</p> <p><a type="internal">Saudi cleric condemns snowmen as anti-Islamic</a></p> <p>“If there is no such defect then it is not permitted for a Muslim girl or woman to expose her eyebrows in front of non-Muslim men” the study concluded.</p> <p>But most Muslim women have refused to follow the new fatwa. “They have no right to curtail our freedom. The world is changing. Muslim women are now allowed to drive in Gulf countries and they are issuing fatwas on eyebrow plucking. It is a shame on our Maulanas and scholars,’ said Sophia Ahmed.</p> <p>Another woman, Safia Begum, said, “The fatwa also applies on Muslim men not to shave. Show me how many Muslim men in India are keeping a beard these days, except for these fake Maulanas. They should better watch ‘Lipstick under my burqa’ before issuing such ridiculous fatwas.

US politician Hillary Rodham Clinton delivers a speech during a ceremony where she received a Honorary Doctorate at Swansea University, in recognition of her commitment to promoting the rights of families and children around the world... <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to revive his long-standing complaint about the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, alleging that then-Director James Comey had protected the Democratic presidential nominee by prematurely “exonerating” her before the 2016 election.</p> <p>“Comey stated under oath that he didn’t do this — obviously a fix?” Trump wrote. “Where is Justice Dept?”</p> <p>Trump’s latest online burst came in response to the FBI’s release of heavily blacked out draft statements from May 2016 by Comey in preparation for closing the Clinton investigation without criminal charges.</p> <p>Trump tweeted that the draft statements, whose existence was previously known, show the FBI had exonerated “Crooked Hillary Clinton” long before the investigation was complete. He tweeted: “James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!”</p> <p>In interview excerpts released in August by the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI officials said Comey and investigators had determined by the spring of 2016 that charges weren’t warranted, and had begun thinking of how the public should be informed of that decision. Clinton was interviewed by the FBI in early July, just days before Comey announced the investigation’s conclusion. That timing has prompted criticism that FBI leadership had prejudged the conclusion before completing the investigation.</p> <p>When Comey announced the end of the case last year, he said the FBI had found no evidence that anyone intended to violate laws governing classified materials, which it considered a prerequisite for bringing a case. He said the FBI had thoroughly investigated the case for a year before deciding to conclude it.</p> <p>“We went at this very hard to see if we could make a case,” Comey told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee days after announcing his recommendation that Clinton not face charges.</p> <p>Trump, as both a candidate and now president, has long complained about the FBI’s handling of the email case, though his criticism has varied.</p> <p>He initially cited Comey’s actions in the investigation as a basis for Comey’s firing in May, though Trumo later acknowledged that he was determined to replace the FBI director even without the recommendation of the Justice Department.</p> <p>The president complained again after Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released excerpts of interviews with FBI officials close to Comey. Those interviews showed that draft statements to close out the Clinton investigation had begun circulating among a tight circle of FBI officials in the spring of 2016.</p> <p>The interviews were conducted by officials from the Office of Special Counsel who were trying to determine if Comey’s actions had violated a federal law that bars government officials from using their positions to influence an election. That investigation was closed following Comey’s firing by Trump in May.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP</p> <p>Copyright © 2018 The Associated Press.

	<article id="0001035" published-at="2017-12-01" title="The GOP Tax-Pocalypse: Trump Shows GOP That the Truth is Now Irrelevant to the Republican Base"><p>Republican senators know this tax bill will be disastrous. But they all are falling in line.</p> Photo Credit: Flickr Creative Commons / DonkeyHotey <p>When Barack Obama became president in 2009, he called together all the opinion leaders in Washington and announced that he was planning to propose a Grand Bargain that would include a cut in "entitlement" spending in exchange for the Republicans agreeing to allow the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans to expire. It had progressive Democrats in a state of agitation, feeling that the president was selling out the signature achievement of the New Deal for a temporary tax hike.</p> <p>The Tea Party right refused to take yes for an answer. The Democrats were offering to take the heat and cut those hated "entitlements," yet the far right couldn't bear raising taxes on rich people. Silly Tea Partyers, didn't they realize that they were walking away from a great deal?</p> <p>It turns out they were biding their time until they held all the levers of power again so they could slash taxes for the wealthy, raise taxes on everyone else and institute "triggers" to cut vital programs as soon as their deep cuts start to raise the deficit, as they inevitably will. Why take half a loaf when you can hold out and get the whole bakery?</p> <p>They even did a trial run in one of the "laboratories of democracy" to prove to everyone how slashing taxes on the wealthy and cutting all those "entitlements" that encourage dependency will boost growth dramatically and make everybody richer, happier and more successful. This was what we might call Sam Brownback's "Make Kansas Great Again" plan, which <a href="https://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/jun/19/brownback-gets-heat-real-live-experiment-comment-t/" type="external">he literally sold</a> to his constituents by saying their state was going to be the "Petri dish" for all the supply-side economic lunacy the right has been trying to enact for decades.</p> <p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/10/10/sam_brownbacks_last_ditch_hail_mary_a_deplorable_voter_suppression_plan/" type="external">He did it, too.</a> And it didn't work out very well. As one Kansas Republican lawmaker <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/tax-trump-kansas/542532/" type="external">told the Atlantic</a>:</p> <q> <p>“It was supposed to increase the GDP, and it didn’t. The feds will have that same problem,” said state Senator Jim Denning, a conservative who originally supported the tax cuts. In a phone interview, Denning told me he had done his own economic modeling in 2012 and “proved to myself that the tax cut would work.” But the new policy did not prevent a rural recession in Kansas or a dip in its oil-and-gas business. “It generated hardly any measurable economic activity,” Denning said. By the beginning of this year, he had changed course and voted along with Democrats and a coalition of Republicans to reverse most of the cuts, erasing Brownback’s economic legacy.</p> </q> <p>Donald Trump generously relieved Kansans of Brownback himself, by nominating him to be the ambassador-at-large for "international religious freedom." He has not yet been confirmed.</p> <p>Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, has been getting an earful from his constituents who are gobsmacked that he is planning to vote to do to the whole country what they did to their state. The Kansas City Star editorial board <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article186974513.html" type="external">recounted a conversation</a> the senator had with one of his voters who asked him: “Why would you take this failed experiment nationwide? Our members of Congress should be the ones leading the way for tax reform that actually affects normal people, not just millionaires and billionaires.”</p> <p><a type="internal">Report Advertisement</a></p> <p>Sadly, that's unlikely. Certainly Sam Brownback won't be issuing the warning. He's in Washington this week trying to push through his confirmation -- and <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/11/30/sam-brownback-trolls-america-the-guy-who-wrecked-kansas-is-the-gops-role-model/" type="external">telling outrageous lies</a>, as Salon's Sophia Tesfaye wrote earlier. Apparently, Donald Trump shared with Brownback some of that strange brew that makes people believe that up is down and black is white:</p> <q> <p>Yes, guys. I'm aware of what happened in Kansas. Here's our story from last year: <a href="https://t.co/BeRqwbN23B" type="external">https://t.co/BeRqwbN23B</a></p>— Richard Rubin (@RichardRubinDC) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardRubinDC/status/935956701127290881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">November 29, 2017</a> </q> <p>Surely the Republicans all know this. Moran even admitted that Kansas is "discussed" in Washington, one assumes as a cautionary tale. And yes, the federal government is not like a state for a hundred different reasons, which makes it unlikely that the consequences would be exactly the same. Nonetheless, it's patently obvious that this tax plan will be a disaster on a national scale, probably resulting in some kind of crisis these same Republicans will then insist requires deep austerity measures to fix. That's the game as it's been played for 30 years, and it's always worked out fine for them. They cut taxes on the rich and the economy eventually goes to hell, at which point Democrats are voted in to clean up the mess, and the GOP insists on spending cuts to vital programs to pay off the debt they incurred with their tax-cutting spree.</p> <p><a type="internal">Report Advertisement</a></p> <p>Unlike in the past, these tax cuts are extremely unpopular. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-tax-cuts-are-even-more-unpopular-than-past-tax-hikes/" type="external">According to FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten,</a> this bill is more unpopular than most tax hike bills are. Why? Because everyone knows it's a giveaway to the rich at the expense of the middle class. The GOP Congress could take its time and fashion a bill where the numbers add up. That could at least pass muster with most Republican voters. So why are they in such a frenzy to pass this monstrosity?</p> <p>It's hard to know. It's almost as if congressional Republicans are on autopilot, unable to exercise free will. Many of them, like Moran of Kansas, know very well that this plan is an utter disaster that will result in higher taxes for everyone but the top 1 percent, along with the degradation of important programs like Medicare, all of which will be used against them in upcoming elections. If I had to guess, I'd say they are simply mesmerized by what Trump has been able to do.</p> <p>All week long we've been reading stories about how he is creating his own reality, unmoored from facts and truth. People are whispering about the 25th Amendment and wondering if the president of the United States might actually have a breakdown. But these GOP officials watched Trump give a speech in Missouri on Wednesday, where the crowd cheered wildly while he claimed that his plan has wealthy people like himself complaining about having their taxes increased so ordinary people can have a big tax cut.</p> <p>Republican senators all know that's a brazen lie. It is literally the opposite of the truth. But they see those Trump voters believing every word he says, and they understand that the truth is now irrelevant to the Republican base. All Trump's supporters want is to see their hero win. If he loses yet again because the Republican Congress fails to deliver a bill for him to sign, members of that Congress know there will be hell to pay.</p> <p>Republicans are happy to pass a tax cut, of course. It's what they live for. But this is a Kansas-level economic debacle in the making, and they are not stupid enough not to understand that. They're betting that their seats are safer if they go along with Trump's magical thinking than if they stay in the real world. After all, the Republicans have been lying almost as much as Trump -- about almost as many things -- for a long time. This time they've decided to hold their collective breath and dive down the rabbit hole with him. Maybe some of that Trump Teflon will rub off on them.</p> <a href="http://www.alternetsurveys.org/survey-is-omarosa-telling-the-truth-about-trump/" type="external"/> <p>Heather Digby Parton, also known as " <a href="https://digbysblog.blogspot.com/" type="external">Digby</a>," is a contributing writer to Salon.

TheBasedGod—has been temporarily banned from Facebook for violating the site’s policies on hate speech, with the offending posts quickly being removed by Facebook. On Twitter, Lil B explained that he was for <a href="https://twitter.com/LILBTHEBASEDGOD/status/917316666702290945" type="external">“talking about white people,”</a> and the Motherboard post notes that a number of black activists have also recently been banned for making statements about white people on Facebook. Now, after some predictable backlash to the ban, Lil B has shared the posts in question:</p> <p>Facebook is also commenting on the ban now, explaining that it will last for 30 days and that it comes from “at least five violations” of the site’s policies (though Lil B says he was only notified of two).

In his seminal text, historian Jack D. Forbes describes how Columbus and the other "civilized" Westerners have spent centuries committing genocide, acts of terrorism, and environmental destruction.

Celebrated scholar and expert Erika Lee seeks to correct that in The Making of Asian America, a history book of Asian Americans that spans centuries and the globe. An engaging text about Asian Americans' past — as slaves in the Caribbean, as railroad laborers in the Pacific Northwest, as prisoners in internment camps during WWII — as well as their present, racially charged status as America's "model minorities," this book offers a new way of looking at race, immigration, and identity in the United States.</p> 'An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States' by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz <p>Another much-needed history lesson about the United States as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807057835/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=bustle6890-20&amp;linkId=7803f67c4391c93b9c6b5e2381272b60" type="external">told from the perspective of the people who were here first</a>, this eye-opening text explores the more than four centuries of oppression, colonialism, genocide, and resistance that is all too often left out of traditional history books. In An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States, activist and celebrated historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz re-frames America's founding story and subsequent history to include the policies and practices of American settlers, colonists, and later citizens that not only drove indigenous people from their land, but attempted to wipe them from the map (and the history books) forever.

A fascinating look at the ways the American government has worked to prop white people up and keep black people down, this book will change the way you see affirmative action.</p> '1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus' by Charles C. Mann <p>Despite the fact that most American history books start with Christopher Columbus's "discovery" of America, the country's rich history starts long before the Europeans stepped foot on its shore.

Baptist <p>In most American history books, slavery is painted as a dark and distant chapter in the country's otherwise glowing history. But in Edward E.

If you're feeling helpless, it's a good time to learn <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/las-vegas-mass-shooting-reignites-gun-debate-us-congress/4055004.html" type="external">how to call your representative for gun control reform</a>.</p> <p>As The Washington Post has reported, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/10/02/police-shut-down-part-of-las-vegas-strip-due-to-shooting/" type="external">at least 50 people have been killed and more than 400 have been injured as a result of the attack</a> carried out by a shooter staying at the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. When a SWAT team descended on the shooter's room at the casino, they found him deceased from an alleged self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-suspect-weapons-guns-explosives" type="external">recovered more than 10 rifles that the shooter used</a> to fire on concert-goers attending a country music festival on the Las Vegas strip; they have yet to determine a motive.</p> <q>
 Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. </q> <p>Among those calling for <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/dec/11/high-capacity-magazine-ban-a-must-for-nevadans-saf/" type="external">gun control reform is Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo</a>, who in a 2016 interview with the Las Vegas Sun said that there is no practical reason for anyone to possess high-capacity magazines.</p> <q>
 "I'm a very avid hunter, I was in the military myself, and there’s no need to have a high-capacity magazine for any practical reason," Lombardo said during a recent interview with the Sun. </q> <q>
 To the contrary, the dangers posed by such magazines are obvious. Lombardo says the time it takes for suspects to change magazines gives potential victims an opportunity to escape and law enforcement officials an opportunity to safely fire back. That being the case, the fewer times a shooter has to switch out magazines, the fewer the chances for people to get away and authorities to get a protected shot. </q> <p>If you want to add your voice to the list of people asking for laws that make it harder to obtain assault rifles, here's <a href="http://act.everytown.org/call/dont-gut-our-gun-laws/" type="external">how to call your representatives about gun control reform</a>.</p> How To Contact Your Reps About Gun Control Reform <p>First, if you don't know who you senators and reps are, the group Everytown for Gun Safety makes is easy to find out.

 [S]end an overwhelming message of opposition to Congress. Call your senators and tell them you OPPOSE concealed carry reciprocity. </q> <q>
 When you reach a staff member or a voicemail box, please tell them the following things: 1. Tell them your name, and that you're a constituent. 2. Tell them to vote NO on <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/446" type="external">Senate Bill 446</a>, what they call "concealed carry reciprocity". </q> <p>Let them know that you're not OK with the fact that <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-by-the-numbers/" type="external">those living in the U.S. are 25 times more likely to die as a result of gun violence</a> than people living in other developed countries. You can also text your support by texting ACT to the number 64433.</p> <p>Another way to make your voice heard is to harness the power of social media and <a href="http://act.everytown.org/call/dont-gut-our-gun-laws/" type="external">tweet at Congress to ask them to support gun control reform</a>. The form from Everytown can set up the tweet for you, you just need to add your congressperson's Twitter handle.</p> <p>If there is any doubt that gun violence is a problem, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts" type="external">consider these facts compiled by Vox</a>:</p> the U.S. has 4.4 percent of the world’s population, but almost half of the civilian-owned guns around the world the U.S. has far more deaths from gun violence than any other developed nation in the world there have been more than 1,300 mass shootings since Sandy Hook on average, there is more than one mass shooting for each day in the U.S. states with more guns have more gun deaths, while states with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths support for gun ownership has sharply increased since the early '90s <p>It's time to <a href="http://act.everytown.org/call/dont-gut-our-gun-laws/" type="external">let your Congress members know where you stand</a> on gun control reform.

He said Monday he didn’t know what prompted Paddock to end his deadly gunfire.</p> <p>The gunman had shot at aviation fuel tanks, stocked his car with explosives and had personal protection gear as part of an escape plan, authorities said Monday.</p> <p>Paddock’s life has remained somewhat of a mystery and most people who have interacted with him said nothing really stood out about him.</p> <p>“It’s his actual normalcy that makes him a fascinating study,” said David Gomez, a former FBI profiler.</p> <a href="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2017/10/AP17275733995015-e1507032352746.jpg" type="external"/> This undated photo provided by Eric Paddock on October 1, 2017, shows his brother, Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock. (Courtesy of Eric Paddock via AP) <p>The small group people who knew Paddock well has said the one-time IRS agent and the son of a notorious bank robber did essentially nothing except gamble, sleep and travel between casinos. Investigators are sifting through every piece of Paddock’s life from birth to death, Lombardo has said.</p> <p>“Every piece of information we get is one more piece of the puzzle,” the sheriff said Monday.</p> <p>Experts say it is extremely unusual to have so few clues more than a week after a mass shooting. In past mass killings or terrorist attacks, killers left notes, social media postings and information on a computer, or even phoned police.</p> <p>In this case, there was no suicide note, no manifesto, no evidence the gunman was motivated by any ideology and Paddock has no clear presence on social media, police said.</p> <p>The FBI is working around-the-clock and a “comprehensive picture is being drawn as to the suspect’s mental state,” the sheriff said. Though at this point, they haven’t found any one particular event in Paddock’s life that triggered the shooting, he said.</p> <p>Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg said Monday an autopsy was done but could not discuss results of whether it yielded any clues to Paddocks actions.</p> <p>But even as investigators work to try to figure out what might’ve led Paddock to commit the shooting, there may never be a clear answer.</p> <p>“Sometimes there isn’t an understandable explanation for why someone commits a horrific crime,” Gomez said.</p> <p>What has become very clear to investigators is that Paddock meticulously planned the attack. He requested an upper-floor room overlooking the country music festival and set up cameras inside and outside his room to watch for approaching officers.</p> <a href="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2017/10/AP17275498021240.jpg" type="external"/> Drapes billow out of broken windows at the Mandalay Bay resort and casino on the Las Vegas Strip, October 2, 2017(AP/John Locher) <p>After the shooting, police found a piece of paper on a nightstand in Paddock’s hotel room that contained a series of numbers that helped him calculate a more precise aim, accounting for the trajectory of shots being fired from that height and the distance between his room and the concert, a federal official said. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the details of the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>In not leaving behind an easily accessible manifesto, Paddock defied societal expectations that mass murderers will want their disturbed motives known to the world, said Clint Van Zandt, a former FBI profiler and hostage negotiator.</p> <p>“The reason you want to engage in an attack is you want to be promoting your extremist ideology — you want publicity,” said Erroll Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California. “You want people to be afraid of what you believe and what you do.”</p> <p>But although most killers may want to take credit for their act, Paddock might have reveled in the riddle he’s presented for investigators, Van Zandt said.</p> <p>“He may even find some solace knowing that, ‘I’ve left so few footprints, they’re going to have a helluva time figuring out who I am.’ And that, in his challenged mind, might bring him a terrible level of satisfaction,” he said.</p> <p>Despite the absence of easy answers, investigators may still be able to fill out a portrait of Paddock’s mindset in the coming weeks, Van Zandt said.</p> <p>“Instead of a eureka moment, I think what investigators are doing is they’re putting an ounce of information at a time on the scale,” he said.</p></article>

Donald Trump. (Evan Vucci / <a href="http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/APTOPIX-Trump/e00f4296bf6a47eaa376175b2aeba9c3/1/1" type="external">AP</a>) <p>What’s worrying isn’t that Trump is now getting advice about policy from fanatics like John Bolton and Lawrence Kudlow. Trump has never cared about policy.</p> <p>The real worry is that – with Robert Mueller breathing down his neck, and several special elections suggesting a giant “blue wave” in November – Trump is getting ready to do whatever it takes to maintain his power, even if that requires fanatical policies.</p> <p>Trump is preparing for an epic war over the future of his presidency. This has required purging naysayers from his Cabinet and White House staff, and replacing them with bomb-throwing advocates like Bolton and Kudlow.</p> <p>Fox News is preparing for the same war, and has made a parallel purge – removing Trump critics like George Will, Megyn Kelly, and Rich Lowry, and installing Trump marketers like Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin, and Sebastian Gorka.</p> <p>Trump and Fox News are also approaching the war with the same story.</p> <p>Some of it is by now familiar: Liberals have opened America to hostile forces – unauthorized immigrants, Muslims, Chinese traders, criminal gangs, drug dealers, government bureaucrats, coastal elites (Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi), North Korea, Iran, and “political correctness” in all its forms.</p> <p>Trump intends to protect America from these forces.</p> <p>The new twist to the story– requiring the recent purges and a united front – is that these forces are conspiring with the FBI to oust Trump from the presidency.</p> <p>The membrane separating Trump’s brain from Fox News has always been thin, but in coming months it’s likely to disappear entirely.</p> <p>We all know Trump watches an inordinate amount of Fox News, beginning in the wee hours with “Fox and Friends,” which provides much of the fodder for his morning tweets.</p> <p>Trump has made John Bolton his National Security Advisor not because Bolton has valuable insights about foreign affairs, but because Bolton – for years, an on-air fixture on Fox News – is a showman who knows how to sell big lies and crazy ideas, and thereby help Trump in the looming battles.</p> <p>As undersecretary of state for arms control in the Bush administration Bolton did more than anyone else to market the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. During his year and a half at the United Nations, Bolton was so outspokenly critical of the organization that he gained the devotion of xenophobic conservatives.</p> <p>It hasn’t hurt that Bolton has sucked up to Trump since then. Describing Trump’s address last year to the United Nations, Bolton swooned “in the entire history of the United Nations, there has never been a more straightforward criticism of the unacceptable behavior of other member states.”</p> <p>Kudlow isn’t a Fox News pundit but he’s been the next best thing – a rightwing CNBC contributor known for his sharp wit and salesmanship.</p> <p>Several other cable news anchors and pundits are already in the Trump administration or will soon be, providing additional ammunition for Trump’s pending war.</p> <p>“He’s looking for people who are ready to be part of that television White House,” says Kendall Phillips, a communication studies professor at Syracuse University. “This is the Fox television presidency all the way up and down.”</p> <p>How can a television presidency be dangerous? Because it is solely about marketing Trump. Its only goal is to win. It is unconstrained by truth, reason, or the Constitution. It doesn’t give a fig about the public.</p> <p>When the occupant of the White House and the sycophants surrounding him are prepared to do and use anything – including trade wars with China and possibly hot wars with North Korea and Iran – to win a political war at home, nothing and no one is safe.</p></article>

Rob Smith (@robsmithonline) has all the details! Buzz60</p> Conservative institutions have embraced Bannon's political slaughter not for his past sins but because he criticized the president. That's chilling. <p>Steve Bannon — the loathed architect of President Trump’s alt-right hate machine, Breitbart lies, racism, misogyny and Twitter thug troll factory — is banished to political Siberia. It was swift and decisive.</p> <p>Bannon is a deplorable human being who has no business being in a position of power or having the ear of any lawmaker. But as deplorable as he may be, his destruction by Trump and the sycophantic army Bannon helped incubate should frighten every American. Why? Because it’s not why he was taken down and kicked to the curb.</p> <p>The former top campaign strategist, <a type="internal">former National Security Council member</a> (appointed by Trump) and former Breitbart News chairman has been given the heave-ho by pretty much the entire Trump establishment. Yet just days ago, he was king and kingmaker, second only to Trump, and viewed by many as Trump’s Svengali.</p> <p>More: <a type="internal">Trump team collusion with Russia? Ukraine connection may hold key.</a></p> <p>More: <a type="internal">Michael Wolff book: Bannon's downfall with Trump, Breitbart and the Mercers?</a></p> <p>At Breitbart, Bannon created an online haven — a fertile safe space — for white nationalists and anti-Semites. Then he mobilized them behind a reality show host/failed casino owner/conspiracy theorist buffoon who won the GOP presidential nomination, largely because his outrageous clown show was ratings gold.</p> <p>Many right-wing media figures, authors and commentators had made their fame and fortune with a Clinton in the White House. They likely wanted a repeat of that success and no doubt believed a Trump nomination ensured a Hillary Clinton win. I’m guessing more than a few publishers have a stale anti-President Hillary book proposal or two gathering dust in a drawer.</p> <p>Bannon openly campaigned to tear down American institutions, the Republican Party and the government. His white nationalism was first ignored, then tolerated and even welcomed by some. When Trump brought him to the White House as a top aide, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/white-nationalists-on-bannon/" type="external">Bannon's appointment was cheered</a> by leaders of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party and other white nationalist groups.</p> <p>Backed by the power of enormous amounts of money from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/01/05/rebekah-mercer-the-billionaire-backer-of-bannon-and-trump-chooses-sides/?utm_term=.560858326071" type="external">uber-wealthy Mercers</a>, Bannon and Breitbart were being normalized. They worked to normalize Trump.</p> <p>Such was Bannon’s ability to infiltrate society with his and Trump’s morally reprehensible attitudes, they both vigorously <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/06/568755950/bannon-campaigns-for-roy-moore" type="external">campaigned</a>for Alabama's Senate candidate Roy Moore — who was credibly accused by multiple women of molesting them when they were adolescents and teens. Moore led in the polls for weeks before his defeat.</p> <p>Bannon is now ruined because in a few moments of uncharacteristic truth-telling to <a type="internal">Fire and Fury</a> author Michael Wolff, he shared the identical sentiments and concerns as his colleagues and most of his fellow citizens. He described suspicions and assumptions that nearly all of Washington, the press corps, Congress and many Americans share: that Trump knew full well his relatives and staff were meeting in Trump Tower with the Russians to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. Conspiracy and collusion.</p> <p>Let that sink in for a moment. When Bannon promoted white nationalism, misogyny, an accused child molester, severe online bullying and conspiracy theories, he was a king to the right-wing media, Trump and most of the Republicans in Congress. But when he dared to tell the truth, when confirmation from an insider could help save the country from the danger, Bannon was cut out like a member of Tony Soprano’s “family” who turned state’s evidence.</p> <p>It’s one thing for Trump to cut off ties to Bannon. But the wholesale embracing of Bannon’s political slaughter by conservative institutions for this, rather than for his past ugly sins, is quite another.</p> <p>Finally, dropped by the Mercers, and by extension and formally by Breitbart, Bannon is now a man without a country, friends or home. That conveys an ominous message: Do not criticize this American president or you will be destroyed.</p> <p>More: <a type="internal">Trump's 'stable genius' reality check: America, this isn't a drill</a></p> <p>POLICING THE USA: A look at <a type="internal">race, justice, media</a></p> <p>It doesn’t matter who is the target, or that our disgust toward the likes of Bannon is appropriate and well-earned. The swiftness and robot-like precision with which Trump’s allies dislodged their lips from Bannon’s MAGA derriere, so they could effectively reach for their shivs upon orders from Trump, is chilling.</p> <p>Not one White House staffer has publicly questioned whether Bannon’s words rang true. Not one Republican senator has suggested publicly that perhaps we should pay heed to Bannon’s words to Wolff. No one at Breitbart, or the Mercers, or the Republican National Committee or even Bannon’s Gilligan to his Skipper, Corey Lewandowski, seems curious about what Bannon said — and if it’s true, what danger the country may be in. The only concern is to protect and cover for Trump at all costs.</p> <p>Even so, Bannon and others who “know too much” can be dangerous to a president with a few too many secrets. Trump would be wise to heed this advice: Never put anyone in a position where they’ve got nothing left to lose.</p> <p>Cheri Jacobus, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a Republican consultant and commentator and president of Capitol Strategies PR.

	<article id="0001058" published-at="2017-10-27" title="The sickness of Russian collusion-projection"><a href="http://www.subscribepage.com/g4c3q7" type="external">Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE</a> Let us assemble the new facts that we have from the Uranium One scandal, as it is called, and how they relate to the Russian collusion investigation being led by Special Counsel/Prosecutor Robert Mueller and his 16 high-powered and well-paid Democrat-leaning lawyers. <p>Tipped off by a confidential informer, in 2009 the FBI started collecting evidence that “ <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration" type="external">showed</a> Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.” Evidence also indicated that higher level Russian officials had given millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation – Bill and Hillary’s charitable organization – during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served in office, and on a government body called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In 2010, Secretary Clinton, along with other board members, unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, which gave Russia control of more than 20 percent of the U.S.’s uranium supply.</p> <p>Uranium is, of course, crucial to the production of nuclear weapons, which both the U.S., and Russia, have in huge abundance. This makes the whole Uranium One scandal a major national security problem.</p> <p>In 2010, even having all the above evidence, the FBI and the Department of Justice did nothing but continue to investigate. Four more years passed, until, finally, one of the Russian participants was charged and convicted of a single charge of money laundering for the scheme that stretched from 2004 to 2014. Another year passed before the DoJ finally issued a press release on the situation. Prominent FBI officials, and leading congressmen on the Republican side (which controlled the U.S. House beginning in 2011), were never fully briefed on the case.</p> <p>You will never guess which prominent names were part of the FBI/DoJ investigation. Robert Mueller, who now serves as Special Counsel/Prosecutor of the Russian Collusion investigation, was the director of the FBI from 2009 through 2013. He had to know about the Uranium One investigation. James Comey, Mueller’s successor as FBI Director, took over in 2013, staying till he was fired by Trump earlier this year. He also had to know of the Uranium One investigation. Andrew McCabe, who was then an Assistant FBI Director but now is Deputy Director, led the Uranium One investigation on the FBI side, while then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, appointed to that position by President Obama, and who now serves as deputy attorney general under President Trump, led the prosecution team. As deputy attorney general, Rosenstein has the distinction of appointing Robert Mueller as Special Counsel for the Russian Collusion investigation after James Comey’s leaks persuaded Rosenstein <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449849/sessions-trump-following-federal-regulations-could-have-avoided-mess" type="external">to ignore</a> proper DoJ procedures that mandate that there be an underlying criminal matter being investigated prior to the appointment of a special counsel. Mind you, the Russian Collusion investigation is a counter-intelligence investigation, and not a criminal investigation, so such an investigation was simply not merited at the time, although the Mueller team have since annexed other criminal matters, such as the investigation of alleged Turkish bribes to former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.</p> <p>And, of course, Hillary Clinton, then-Secretary of State, and eventually the 2016 Democrat nominee for president, who the day after her unexpected loss to Trump <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/04/21/shattered-revelation-clinton-campaign-hatched-russian-hacking-narrative-24-hours-after-hillarys-loss/" type="external">hatched</a> the Russia hacking propaganda story that led directly to the Russian Collusion investigation, was the one who took the alleged bribes for Uranium One.</p> <p>So, when it comes to the Uranium One scandal, we have here a situation where all these characters may have been implicated in a real Russian bribery scandal, largely unprosecuted – except one man – despite loads of evidence, which transferred U.S. uranium to Russian control. But, instead of suffering any penalties for their unwillingness to protect U.S. national security interests, these individuals have turned the tables, and are going after President Donald Trump for his supposed collusion with Putin to “hack” the election. All with virtually no evidence for the Russian Collusion investigation.</p> <p>There is a name for such a sickness. In psychology, there is the idea of “projection.”</p> <p>“Projection is a psychological <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/defense-mechanisms" type="external">defense mechanism</a> in which individuals attribute characteristics they find unacceptable in themselves to another person.” Hillary Clinton, Robert Mueller, James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, and Andrew McCabe are guilty of projection.</p> <p><a type="internal">BombThrowers -- Eli David -- Bio and Archives</a> | <a type="internal">Comments</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.bombthrowers.com" type="external">Bombthrowers</a> is a blog about politics and the war for the hearts and minds of Americans from a conservative viewpoint.</p> <p>In line with our name, we do not hold back.

But is there a downside to this practice?</p> <p>Sharon Sanborn recently discovered that the answer to that question is a resounding yes.</p> <p>Sanborn’s case points to the fact that if you decide to try this “travel hack,” it is a bit of a gamble and you may end up losing.</p> <p>Squaremouth helps travelers easily and instantly compare travel insurance policies from all major providers. Only companies that meet the strict requirements of Squaremouth’s Zero Complaint Guarantee are available on the website. Compare policies on <a href="https://www.squaremouth.com/travel-insurance-quotes?aid=103" type="external">Squaremouth.com</a> to save over 70 percent on your next purchase.</p> <p>Buying two one-way tickets</p> <p>“I purchased a ticket for my granddaughter on Delta with a return on United a week later,” she told our advocates in her <a type="internal">request for help</a>. “Delta canceled the outbound flight entirely and my granddaughter could not get to Colorado Springs. So I want United to give me a refund.”</p> <p>When an airline cancels your flight, it is perfectly reasonable to expect a refund for that flight. But there were multiple complications with Sanborn’s ticket, which ultimately prevented her from receiving reimbursement for that return segment.</p> <p>First, she <a href="https://www.travelocity.com" type="external">purchased her granddaughter’s ticket through Travelocity</a>. In doing so, she immediately added a layer of difficulty to any issues that were encountered with the reservation. Booking directly with the airlines will always make any problems you may encounter with your ticket easier to rectify.</p> <p>Two different airlines</p> <p>Next, she purchased an itinerary that Travelocity created by combining two one-way tickets on two different airlines.</p> <p>The way Travelocity confirmed Sanborn’s reservation could give an infrequent traveler the impression of having purchased a single, contiguous ticket — if one part were to be canceled by the airline, the entire ticket could be refunded.</p> <p>However, at the bottom of the reservation, Travelocity spells out the terms of the ticket and clarifies: “We have combined two one-way tickets to get the best deal. If you need to make changes or cancel, you’ll need to do it twice — once for each one-way ticket.”</p> <p>Two separate tickets</p> <p>What it doesn’t explicitly spell out is that if the traveler needs to cancel this nonrefundable ticket, two cancellation fees will be accessed. And if the airline cancels one of the flights, there is no policy or protection by which the traveler can ask for a refund of the other unrelated flight.</p> <p>If Sanborn had purchased this ticket as a round-trip flight on the same airline, she would have qualified for a full refund of the cost of the ticket. Because she didn’t, she only received a refund of the canceled Delta ticket. She was then stuck with the nonrefundable return flight, which had a hefty cancellation fee.</p> <p>The cancellation fee essentially made that one-way ticket worthless, and Sanborn lost several hundred dollars.</p> <p>The bad news</p> <p>In the end, we couldn’t help Sanborn recoup her losses. The way she purchased this ticket through Travelocity made it impossible.</p> <p>You may find savings by booking two one-way tickets. However, before doing so, you should weigh the cost and benefits against the potential loss that could result.

While in office, this protection extends to a president’s immediate family. But does this ever include their family pet? Technically no.</p> <p>According to former Secret Service agent Dan Emmett, as noted in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Within-Arms-Length-Extraordinary-Special/dp/1462070728/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493201719&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Within+Arm's+Length&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=tifo-youtube-20&amp;linkId=979c31933a9c0fe37c7e48f56055b5c5" type="external">Within Arm’s Length</a>, the agents tasked with protecting the First Family are under no obligation to protect any pets said family may own. In fact, he noted that even beyond not directly having any obligation to protect the animals, “Walking the dog or cat is not and will never be a part of an agent’s job description.”</p> <p>Emmett put this little tidbit in a section of his book specifically dispelling myths about the Secret Service. This is a section that humourously enough also includes this gem of a supposedly widely held myth:</p> <q> <p>Myth: All women are attracted to Secret Service agents.</p> </q> <p>Emmett goes on to explain that the truth is actually that only “Many women are attracted to Secret Service agents…” (Presumably to ones called Dan Emmett most of all.) On top of this, he states that the life of a Secret Service agent includes a</p> <q> <p>never-ending string of temptations sometimes literally thrust into one’s face by women who are impressed by such things as men who protect the president. It can be almost frightening at times when seated in a bar, and a woman recognizes and agent she has just seen on television with the president. On more than one occasion, my shift mates and I had phone numbers and hotel room keys shoved into our hands or thrown to us while working a rope line with the president…. For the single agent, it was paradise; for many married agents, it was a constant struggle between good and evil, which was sometimes won and other times lost.</p> </q> <p>Back to literal dogs (as opposed to the cheating kind)- although the Secret Service isn’t obligated by any means to walk or take care of the president’s pet dog or cat (Emmett tersely claims that White House custodial staff do this), it doesn’t mean they don’t necessarily do it.</p> <p>For example, Bo and Sunny, the pet Portuguese Water Dogs of the Obama’s, were often pictured being taken for a walk by some member of Obama’s protective detail. Given there were presumably other staff available for the task when necessary, we can only assume they did this because of scenarios like that the president was in the midst of doing so himself when called away for a moment (so they had to take over temporarily), and perhaps because they liked to walk the dogs, so weren’t quick to call other White House staff in. After all, it stands to reason that Secret Service agents who spend a lot of time around the president would occasionally grow fond of the president’s pets, assuming they liked the type of animal, and thus wouldn’t mind the occasional pet detail.</p> <p>Said agents have also been known to do such things as a favor to the president. For instance, the Secret Service agents tasked with protecting Ronald Reagan after he left office occasionally ran around Reagan’s ranch with his dogs when the former President was physically unable to do so.</p> <p>In all such cases, one would think, despite not being obligated to, they’d even potentially help protect the pet if necessary. Sure, maybe not protect them with their lives as they’re expected to do with the human members of the family, but presumably they’d give it their best go if someone tried to pull a canine assassination or the animal was going to be hit by a car or something. In fact, the Secret Service is known to actively take precautions to keep a president’s pet(s) safe at least in some cases, including things like muzzling their own attack and guard dogs when they’re around the pet(s).</p> <p>And while Emmett never mentioned it, keeping track of the president’s more mobile pets must be somewhat of a priority given that presidential pets are generally given near total freedom to come and go as they please and have essentially unlimited access to the president. First Dogs then arguably have more power than most of the president’s own advisers, seeing as they can walk into his office any time and lick his face without upsetting him (something we presume only the First Lady, or certain interns of yore, could otherwise get away with).</p> <p>Why would the Secret Service care what said animals get up to? This unscreened freedom of access is potentially a major security risk if the animal in question wasn’t being well kept track of. After all, someone could potentially get an explosive device or the like within a large enough dog (perhaps forcing or otherwise coercing them to swallow it or… you know, insert it into the other end). Beyond this, pathogens, toxic substances, etc. could be clandestinely planted on or in the animal’s fur in the hopes the president would soon after pet the animal.</p> <p>So presumably the Secret Service keeps tabs on that it is at least somebody’s job to ensure the animals that have unrestricted access to the president and their family never ventures into unsecured locations or the like, even if it’s not the Secret Service’s job specifically to keep track of the animal(s). (And yes, very unfortunately so-called “suicide bomber animals” are occasionally a thing, one of the more famous cases of this being the sad tale of <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/12/anti-tank-dogs-world-war-ii/" type="external">The Exploding Anti-Tank Dogs of World War II</a>.)</p> <p>On a lighter note, it should be noted that beyond having people wait on you paw and paw and having the ability to poop in the Oval Office, being the president’s animal also has other perks, including potentially a pardon from any crime you may commit.</p> <p>You might think that last one sounds like a joke, but it’s only partially so. For instance, in 2008, President Bush’s beloved dog, Barney, bit two people- Heather Walker, public relations director for the Boston Celtics who got her wrist bitten, and Jonathan Decker, a Reuters reporter who got his finger nipped. Given the many and diverse microbial flora that call a dog’s mouth home (yes, contrary to popular belief, <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/11/a-dogs-mouth-is-not-cleaner-than-a-humans-mouth/" type="external">a dog’s mouth isn’t anywhere close to “cleaner” than a human’s</a>), the pair were given antibiotics to prevent potentially dangerous infection as part of their treatment.</p> <p>For any other dog, such repeated behavior may well have resulted in it being put down, whether the owners wished it or not. However, even without the presidential pardon “get out of jail free” card, there are not many individuals who want to risk becoming near universally hated for pursuing the matter of getting the president’s dog “put to sleep”. Of course, if such a bitten individual tried, it would be interesting to see if the presidential pardon powers legally extend to animals… (And if you’re curious: <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2016/11/short-history-presidential-pardons-commutations/" type="external">Why Do Presidents Get to Pardon People at the End of Their Terms?</a>)</p> <p>If you liked this article, you might also enjoy our new popular podcast, The BrainFood Show ( <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-brainfoodshow/id1350586459" type="external">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/36xpXQMPVXhWJzMoCHPJKd" type="external">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&amp;isi=691797987&amp;ius=googleplaymusic&amp;apn=com.google.android.music&amp;link=https://play.google.com/music/m/Insimdi4g6puyyr4qbt6tup5b6m?t%3DThe_BrainFood_Show%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-na-all-co-pr-mu-pod-16" type="external">Google Play Music</a>, <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/feed/brainfood/" type="external">Feed</a>), as well as:</p> <p>Bonus Facts:</p> Over the years a vast array of unusual and exotic animals have lived in the White House including a pair of alligators (owned by Herbert Hoover) and a raccoon, a bear and a pygmy hippo (all owned by Calvin Coolidge and his family). Many Presidents have given their pets unusual or odd names. Coolidge, for example, owned a lion called Tax Reduction, whereas William McKinley owned a parrot called Washington Post… Lyndon B. Johnson was notably more pragmatic in this regard, simply naming his two beagles Him and Her. Donald Trump is the first President in over a century to not own a dog. As of 2013 after President Obama signed the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012 into law, former Presidents and their spouse are entitled to 24/7 secret service protection for the rest of their lives. This was actually the standard protocol from 1965 to 1996 but was changed to a 10 year period for any President in office after 1997. President Obama saw fit to repeal this change, meaning no President alive today has gone without Secret Service protection since leaving office (unless they voluntarily opt out). Under the law, the protection extends only to a President and their spouse, although a President’s children will similarly receive Secret Service protection until they reach the age of 16. <p>Expand for References</p></article>

	<article id="0001062" published-at="2017-08-10" title="Hate On The Far Left Is Just As Dangerous As Hate On The Far Right"><p>In his <a type="internal">Forward column</a> outlining “19 People Jews Should Worry About More Than Linda Sarsour,” Steven Davidson says that with so many other dangers lurking, he is confounded by the Jewish community’s seeming obsession with the controversial Palestinian-American feminist activist.</p> <p>I share Davidson’s horror at the presence of figures such as Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka in the Oval Office. I worry deeply, too, about “alt-right” or “alt-lite” figures such as Richard Spencer.</p> <p>And yet even with the increasing anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and other forms of hatred we are experiencing, I do worry more about Linda Sarsour than about most of the people on Davidson’s list — at least those involved in domestic American politics. After all, most of the list’s other individuals are known anti-Semites and bigots, fringe figures reviled by significant swaths of the American public.</p> <p>The issue with Linda Sarsour is that she and many of her colleagues on the far left, including some in the LGBTQ community, are creating a false litmus test for progressive activism, one saying that if you are truly progressive you can’t be a Zionist. And, she is doing that with the aura of mainstream acceptability conferred by her Jewish allies and other prominent supporters for whom I generally have tremendous respect.</p> <p>American Jews have been at the vanguard of progressive justice movements for more than a century. Being shunned by these movements because of their support for a Jewish state in Israel is devastating, particularly for those who have devoted countless time and energy to advocating for peace and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians. Sarsour and others present a false “either-or” choice for politically liberal Jews. When push comes to shove, many younger Jews could feel compelled to stifle their Jewish and Zionist identities in order to continue to be accepted in the social and activist circles they hold dear, whether advocating for LGBTQ rights, an end to police brutality and racial profiling, or preservation of reproductive choice. That is a much longer-term danger than any “alt-right” agitator is.</p> <p>On a personal level, I was outraged and pained when Sarsour declared that it is impossible for a woman to be both a Zionist and a feminist. Really? How fortunate that I was unaware of this edict: From my college days organizing students to attend pro-choice rallies in Washington, D.C., to previously directing a Jewish women’s foundation that supports social change projects for Jewish and non-Jewish women and girls in Israel and the United States, my identities as a Jew, a progressive Zionist and a feminist have been seamlessly interwoven.</p> <p>When did Linda Sarsour and other anti-Israel leftists become supreme gatekeepers, determining who may rightfully sit at the table of those who fight for justice and tolerance and equality? According to Sarsour, Zionism is never compatible with human decency, thereby ignoring that Israel itself was created out of the ashes of perhaps the worst genocidal crime in human history.</p> <p>One just as easily could say that she is the one who should be dismissed from that table because of her willful denial that the essential human propensity toward anti-Semitism — a scourge that continues to flourish around the world and in our own backyards — created the urgent moral imperative to establish and sustain a Jewish state in our ancestral homeland in the first place. Jews have a rightful place at that table because of our identities as Zionist Jews, not despite it. We must raise our collective voice to stake this claim proudly and authentically. If we can’t get this message across, both to our own people and to our allies in the social justice arena, we will find ourselves ostracized from the very movements that we have so proudly championed and led for decades. In the process, we could potentially lose a chunk of younger generations of liberal American Jews. Hence, the “Sarsour hysteria” that Davidson finds so baffling.</p> <p>Thankfully, we need not choose between combatting white supremacists and combatting those who deny Israel’s right to existence. We must do both, calling out hatred on both the far right and the far left. They are all equally deserving of our righteous anger.</p> <p>Guila Franklin Siegel is the associate director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington.</p> <p>The views and opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Forward.</p></article>
	<article id="0001063" published-at="2017-08-04" title="The Quadruplets First Trip To Disneyland"><p>This has been a dream of ours since we started talking about our family! Ashley and I both love Disneyland so much! There are so many fond memories there for both us from our childhood, as well as from our marriage. We’ve spent time with parents, friends and siblings enjoying all things magical, and experiencing a dream world that makes you feel like everything is going to be alright!</p> <p>That being said, nothing was going to prepare us for how magical it actually was taking our own children and seeing the magic through their eyes!</p> <p>We booked the Courtyard Marriot at the entrance to the park. We knew if we needed a quick escape, this was going to be crucial for us not having to walk too far. It was so perfect! Not only were the rooms spacious and clean, but the service was excellent! When we were being checked in, they found out we had quads. They immediately gave all the girls little whale stuffed animals from underneath the counter. Obviously they did this with all kids, but after a long morning drive, the girls certainly appreciated it! Also seeing our circumstance, they checked us in early and made sure we were all settled before heading over to park! Big shout out to Paige who took such great care of us! If anyone is looking for lodging, definitely recommend these guys!</p> <p>Planning for the excitement was one thing, but I thought we were crazy if we didn’t think of the other end of the spectrum! Obviously taking four 2 year olds to Disneyland required some extra thought! Were they going to hold up in the summer weather? Did we need to pack extra diaper bags? Did we need to bring a cooler? Were they going to stay in their strollers? If not, would we physically be able to keep track of them? Would they like the rides? Are you starting to get a glimpse of all the worries we had going into the park?</p> <p>Having Madison and Oakland on the trip with us really put most of these questions to bed! For instance they did want to get out of the strollers quite often, but having one adult per child really made this a non-worry issue!</p> <p>By the time we got there on the first day, it was lunchtime. What else but corn dogs!</p> <p>We kept them super hydrated throughout the day! What I love about Disney is you can get ice water at pretty much any of their restaurants free of charge! This was HUGE for us with the kiddos!</p> <p>Although the weather was pretty warm, the stroller canopies and ice water on walks helped tremendously!</p> <p>As soon as we took the kids on their first ride, I knew this trip was going to be a success! We actually started them out on an adult ride, Pirates of the Caribbean! This is one of our favorite rides, and our thought process was if they completely hated it, we could always move to the more kid friendly rides. But we didn’t even need to worry, because all 4 of them completely loved the ride; even to the point of singing “Yo-ho” for several minutes after the ride! They loved being on a boat as well. Even today when we talk about Disney asking them what their favorite ride was, we usually get a “boat” answer from one of them!</p> <p>Everything else was downhill after the first ride! They absolutely loved all the amusement around them! We did Haunted Mansion, which they loved. I think my love of Fall and Halloween helped prepare them for this. The Dumbo ride, Pooh ride, and Pinnochio were all hits! That being said, I don’t think anything topped Small World. They fell in love with this ride, and we fell in love with their excitement and fondness for the ride. What once was Ashley’s least favorite ride, now became a family favorite!</p> <p>Esme didn’t know what to think of the whale??</p> <p>Are there 4 of them? This question never gets old! LOL.</p> <p>#esmefaces</p> <p>Evie’s face just kills me in this photo! Smile on demand!</p> <p>The Carousel was definitely a highlight for the kids. They just lit up when they saw the horses, and wouldn’t stop chattering until we actually put them on one! They loved it!</p> <p>The Disney Crew!</p> <p>Pie faces!</p> <p>Rides aside, I think the churros were the next big hit! The girls absolutely loved the Disney churros, but who doesn’t. Indie was particularly fond to them, just like daddy!</p> <p>By the second day, we made our way over to California Adventure. The adults took turns riding the Grizzly Rapids, while the girls enjoyed snacks in the shade! The favorite ride over there had to be the Mater ride. The girls love all the tractors and trucks, to the point where they kept repeating those words for 20 minutes after the rides! Their excitement was electric, and contagious.</p> <p>We ran into some celebrities while at the park! Anyone remember Magnum P.I.?</p> <p>We enjoyed some restaurants and site seeing throughout both parks, and the girls overall were troopers for all the walking, warm weather, and schedule changes!</p> <p>Mickey Mouse Donuts, “yes please”!!</p> <p>On the second day, we wanted to make it to the firework show, so we started early, and planned a nap in the middle of the day. It went perfectly as we conquered much of Disneyland in the early morning, and then the girls took an incredible nap! Oak and Hugsy stayed an enjoyed the park while Mom an Dad worked during nap time. The girls slept til almost 5, which really was what allowed us to make the firework show at 930, and have the girls happy while doing so! It was a magical end to our Disney experience!</p> <p>Best part of the trip came on the second day. Meeting Mickey and Minnie! The girls absolutely loved this experience, but their faces tell you that!</p> <p>Overall, the girls were absolute troopers, not only for the 2 days at Disney, but for the entire California trip! We had such a wonderful experience watching them experience the magic of Disney for the first time!

Sports reports</a> the insurance policy could be signed prior to the regular season in the event Beckham doesn’t land a lucrative long-term deal.</p> <q> <p>New York Giants star Odell Beckham Jr. will consider acquiring a massive insurance policy – possibly for more than $100 million in injury protection – if he doesn’t reach a contract extension with the team before the NFL‘s regular season begins, two sources close to Beckham told Yahoo Sports.</p> <p>The sources said Beckham’s camp explored injury insurance prior to Monday night, when a scary hit left the player with a sprained ankle in a preseason game against the Cleveland Browns.</p> <p>“[If a deal isn’t done] by the regular season, he’ll take steps to protect himself. [But] a new deal is preferable to adding insurance,” one source said.</p> </q> <p>Beckham said earlier this offseason that he aspires to be the highest-paid player in the NFL — a demand that didn’t even cause a batted eye with Giants co-owner John Mara.</p> <p>“He deserves to get paid, we’re going to pay him, it’s just a question of when we enter into the contract, and I don’t have a time table on it right now,” Mara said. “I just don’t think there’s any need to rush into it. He’s going to end up getting paid at some point.”</p> <p>A policy in excess of $100 million could cost Beckham upwards of $600,000 for the year. However, given that he’s aiming for a contract larger than $100 million, it could potentially be a wise one-year investment for the superstar.</p> <p>Beckham, who is not actively engaged in contract talks with the Giants, went down on Monday night with what initially appeared to be a serious knee injury. However, following x-rays and further examination, it was determined Beckham had merely suffered a sprained ankle.</p> <a type="internal"/> <a type="internal"/></article>
	<article id="0001065" published-at="2017-07-03" title="Kirk Frost Desperate to Win Rasheeda Back Despite Cheating &amp; Possibly Fathering a Child Outside Their Marriage"><p>Despite quite possibly being Jasmine Washington’s baby daddy and recently presenting separation papers to wife Rasheeda, Kirk Frost is reportedly <a href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/03/kirk-frost-wants-rasheeda-back-save-marriage-jasmine-washington-baby/" type="external">fighting for his marriage</a>. A source exclusively tells Hollywood Life that he’s not ready to call it quits.</p> <p>Kirk is currently in the dog house, not even living with his wife. However, the source says he is doing everything in his power to get back into Rasheeda’s good graces. “Kirk is not giving up; he has a plan regardless of the paternity test,” the source revealed. “All he cares about is getting Rasheeda back.”</p> <q> <p>“He’s been bending over backwards to take care of the kids so she can work on Pressed (her Atlanta boutique) and on her new music. He’s an on-call babysitter 24/7. Even if she just wants to go to dinner or shopping he is right there. She’s taking full advantage of it and going out a lot. She goes for lunches and spa days and dinners and leaves him on daddy duty.”</p> </q> <p>Kirk and Rasheeda have been married for 18 years and have two children together. Kirk has repeatedly cheated on her throughout their relationship, but his latest transgression may have resulted in a child. Jasmine claims he is the father of her baby, Kannon, and <a type="internal">paternity results to be announced</a> during the Love &amp;amp; Hip Hop Atlanta reunion could prove it to be true.</p> <p>READ MORE: <a type="internal">You ARE the Father! DNA Test Proves Kirk Frost Is Jasmine Washington’s Baby Daddy</a></p> <p>The source adds that because they have overcome his cheating in the past, Kirk believes Rasheeda will eventually take him back.</p> <q> <p>“Kirk knows it’s an uphill battle to make up for everything that’s happened with Jasmine, but he’s sure he’s eventually going to get things back on track with Rasheeda. They’re a team, they’re best friends, and he doesn’t see them ever really ending. She’s always forgive him in the past and Kirk definitely sees that happening again. In his mind, he and Rasheeda aren’t done. This is just a pause and a temporary bump that will make them stronger in the end.”</p> </q> <p>And you know what? The source just might be right. Rasheeda hasn’t really handled the situation like the “boss chick” she claims to be. Amidst the baby daddy speculation, Rasheeda <a type="internal">admitted that she still loves Kirk</a> during an appearance on The Real. She added that marriage is a lot of work and was not quite ready to let go.

	<article id="0001066" published-at="2017-01-04" title="Failing the children of California"><a type="internal"/> <p>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</p> <p>At the start of each new year we’re subjected to a whole host of new laws. The modern liberal government, you see, imagines itself not as the champion of individual freedom but as Mommy and Daddy, a taskmaster charged with controlling your life. Most of the time, it makes everything, including our lives, worse.</p> <p>Case in point: California. Completely at the mercy of the left, which now controls two-thirds of the state government, California serves as a living illustration of what the left really wants to accomplish. As of Jan. 1, that includes decriminalizing what is commonly called “child prostitution.”</p> <p>They may not have technically legalized it, but decriminalizing the act per se will have the same results, while putting exploited children in even more danger.</p> <p>First, let’s make one thing clear right now: There is no such thing as “child prostitution.” The fact is we’re dealing with the sex trafficking of girls and boys. This isn’t some horror reserved for Thailand or some other far-off place — it’s happening right here in the United States.</p> <p>More than 1,000 children are arrested each year for prostitution, with estimates of sex trafficking involving 100,000 to 2.4 million children. Concerned Women for America reports, “The United States Department of Justice uses the number 293,000 as the estimate for youth ‘at risk’ of being commercially sexually exploited.”</p> <p>The fact that these children are victims is not disputed, but what California has just done makes the problem even worse.</p> <p>A revelatory op-ed in the Washington Examiner by Travis Allen, one of the few Republicans in the California legislature, declaring the state had “legalized” child prostitution, made waves and garnered much-needed attention to the issue.</p> <p>Mr. Travis wrote, “Beginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. Yes, you read that right. SB 1322 bars law enforcement from arresting sex workers who are under the age of 18 for soliciting or engaging in prostitution, or loitering with the intent to do so. So teenage girls (and boys) in California will soon be free to have sex in exchange for money without fear of arrest or prosecution.”</p> <p>So what can law enforcement in California do when they encounter a child selling themselves on the street for sex? The Sacramento Bee explains, “Commercially sexually exploited children, based on the bill’s analysis, may be taken into temporary custody ‘if the minor has an immediate need for medical care, or … is in immediate danger of physical or sexual abuse, or the physical environment’ or the child’s unattended status ‘poses an immediate threat to the child’s health or safety.’ “</p> <p>The operative word here is, of course, “immediate.” But don’t worry — there is something the police must do. The Bee continued to defend the law by assuring readers, “Under the law, officers who encounter minors [selling themselves for sex] must report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect.”</p> <p>That’s right. They must report it to a government agency.</p> <p>So here’s the truth of the matter: This law tells the police there is nothing they are allowed to do with a child obviously engaging in an act against his or her will; an act that amounts to rape once the child sells himself or herself to the stranger looking for a child to purchase.</p> <p>The obscenity of this law is clear: Not only does it tie the hands of law enforcement in removing the child from a threatening environment, it sends a message to the victimized children that their sex trafficker is in charge, that society accepts and allows what’s happening, and ultimately, there is no escape.</p> <p>Mr. Travis notes, this vicious circle “translates into bigger and better cash flow for the pimps. Simply put, more time on the street and less time in jail means more money for pimps, and more victims for them to exploit.”</p> <p>Why would California put sex-trafficked children in such danger by tying the hands of law enforcement when there are alternatives to treating them like criminals? Several states already have legislation that managed to recognize the victim status of the children without abandoning them.</p> <p>Concerned Women for America reports, “New York and Washington State have laws that divert minors arrested for prostitution into services and rehabilitation programs at the discretion of the judge in New York and at the discretion of the prosecutor in Washington. … In Massachusetts, the law diverts minors found in prostitution into services and treatment but keeps the charges pending against them in place until they successfully complete the rehabilitation programs after which the charges are dropped.”</p> <p>If you’re serious about saving children, you don’t limit what law enforcement can do, you expand their options while making sure children are treated as victims, while using the justice system as a way to remove them from their enslavement. Instead, the liberals who run California have just done the opposite, guaranteeing lives ruined while allowing an evil problem to continue virtually unchecked.</p> <p>• Tammy Bruce, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk show host.</p></article>

Debbie Wasserman Schultz</a> said in a statement Wednesday.</p> <p>“It is astounding to me that the chair of an organization like the <a type="internal">DNC</a> was never contacted by the FBI or any other agency concerned about these intrusions,” the Florida Democrat added, Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/21/dnc-no-help-homeland-security-hacks-239800" type="external">reported</a>. “As a member of Congress, I had the unique clearance to hear any classified briefing that would be involved in such an intrusion, and the FBI clearly should have come to me with that information. They did not.”</p> <p>The former <a type="internal">DNC</a> chairwoman’s remarks came within hours of a Wednesday morning congressional hearing during which former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified about the <a type="internal">DNC</a> breach and other offensive cyber activities attributed to Russian state-sponsored hackers.</p> <p>“My interest in helping them was definitely of nonpartisan interest, and I recall very clearly that I was not pleased that we were not in there helping them patch this vulnerability,” Mr. Johnson said of the <a type="internal">DNC</a>.</p> <p>“If the FBI or any other government agency ever came to me with that information, I would have gladly welcomed their help,” <a type="internal">Ms. Wasserman Schultz</a> responded afterwards. “In fact, back in March, former FBI Director [James] Comey testified that he wished he had personally done more to notify the <a type="internal">DNC</a> of the Russian intrusion.”</p> <p>President Trump opined on the topic from his Twitter account early Thursday, tweeting: “Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn’t? It’s all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!”</p> <p><a type="internal">Ms. Wasserman Schultz</a> resigned from her role as chairwoman last July after WikiLeaks published internal Democratic Party correspondence obtained during the <a type="internal">DNC</a> breach, including emails in which she expressed a bias against Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent and former White House hopeful, in favor of the party’s eventual candidate, Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Her interim replacement, Donna Brazile, was fired from her role as CNN contributor three months later after those same emails showed that she shared debate questions with Mrs. Clinton ahead of CNN-sponsored campaign events.</p> <p>The U.S. intelligence community has attributed the <a type="internal">DNC</a> breach and other related intrusions to a state-sponsored influence campaign targeting last year’s White House race allegedly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin in order to benefit Mr. Trump’s campaign.

	<article id="0001068" published-at="2017-05-27" title="Lawsuit by Benghazi families targeting Hillary Clinton dismissed by Obama-appointed federal judge"><a type="internal"/> <p>A federal judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit brought against former Secretary of State <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> by relatives of two Americans killed during the 2012 attack in Benghazi, <a type="internal">Libya</a>.</p> <p><a type="internal">Mrs. Clinton</a> neither enabled the Benghazi attack by using her now-infamous private email server nor defamed its victims’ parents afterwards, U.S. District Court Judge <a type="internal">Amy Berman Jackson</a> ruled Friday in Washington, D.C., casting aside claims raised on behalf of parents of slain State Department information officer <a type="internal">Sean Smith</a> and late <a type="internal">CIA</a> operative <a type="internal">Tyrone Woods</a>.</p> <p>The Smith and <a type="internal">Woods</a> families sued <a type="internal">Mrs. Clinton</a> last August in D.C. federal court alleging she caused their sons’ deaths by discussing sensitive State Dept. matters over an insecure, nongovernmental email system while secretary of state, supposedly providing terrorists with information used to plot the Sept. 11, 2012 ambush, according to the lawsuit.</p> <p>Any emails sent by <a type="internal">Mrs Clinton</a> were within the scope of her position as secretary of state, the Obama-appointed judge ruled Friday, giving the court sufficient reason to dismiss the wrongful death claim on technical grounds, Politico first <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2017/05/26/hillary-clinton-benghazi-email-suits-dismissed-238880?cmpid=sf" type="external">reported</a>.</p> <p>“The Court finds that Secretary <a type="internal">Clinton</a> was acting in the scope of her employment when she transmitted the emails that are alleged to give rise to her liability,” Judge <a type="internal">Jackson</a>‘s <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2016cv1606-37" type="external">29-page opinion</a> reads in part. “The untimely death of plaintiffs’ sons is tragic, and the Court does not mean to minimize the unspeakable loss that plaintiffs have suffered in any way. But when one applies the appropriate legal standards, it is clear that plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to rebut the presumption that Secretary <a type="internal">Clinton</a> was acting in her official capacity when she used her private email server.”</p> <p>“Her actions – communicating with other State Department personnel and advisors about the official business of the department – fall squarely within the scope of her duty to run the Department and conduct the foreign affairs of the nation as Secretary of State,” Friday’s ruling said.</p> <p>The lawsuit also claimed Mrs. Clinton defamed the Smith and <a type="internal">Woods</a> families after the Benghazi attack by allegedly misrepresenting conversations she had with either. Those claims were dismissed Friday as well.</p> <p>“Secretary <a type="internal">Clinton</a> did not refer to plaintiffs as liars,” Judge <a type="internal">Jackson</a> opined. “Plaintiffs may find the candidate’s statements in her own defense to be ‘unpleasant or offensive,’ but Secretary <a type="internal">Clinton</a> did not portray plaintiffs as ‘odious, infamous, or ridiculous….’ To the contrary, the statements portray plaintiffs as normal parents, grieving over the tragic loss of their loved ones.”</p> <p>A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately react to the ruling, and an attorney for <a type="internal">Mrs. Clinton</a> declined to comment, Politico reported Friday.</p> <p>Four Americans in total were killed on Sept. 11, 2012, after terrorists stormed the U.S. consulate in <a type="internal">Libya</a>, including <a type="internal">CIA</a> operative Glen Doherty and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens in addition to <a type="internal">Smith</a> and <a type="internal">Woods</a>.</p></article>

Kimmel said President Trump wants to get rid of Obamacare primarily because it has the former president's name attached to it. Kimmel joked, "we haven't seen this many people come forward to speak against a bill since Cosby."</p> <p>"I guarantee he doesn't know anything about this Graham-Cassidy bill. He doesn't know the difference between Medicare and Medicaid. He barely knows the difference between Melania and Ivanka," Kimmel said to laughter.</p> <p>RELATED: <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/09/21/kimmel_responds_to_kilmeades_hollywood_elite_criticism_ill_pound_you_when_i_see_you.html" type="external">Kimmel Responds To Kilmeade's 'Hollywood Elite' Criticism: "I'll Pound You When I See You"</a></p> <p>Kimmel opened his show advocating against the bill and cited details that made him an opponent:</p> <q>
 KIMMEL: Well, thanks for joining us on what has been an unusual week for us here at our show. If you've been watching over the past few days, and you haven't, I've found myself in the middle of a battle over American health care. After my son Billy had open heart surgery at the end of April, the [Republican] Senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana came on our show, made some promises and assurances that he did not keep. The reason I had him on the show in the first place is because he started telling people that any plan he supports would have to pass what he called 'the Jimmy Kimmel test.' And then he teamed up with Senator Lindsey Graham to write a bill that most definitely does not pass that test. It doesn't protect people from having their rates jacked up for pre-existing conditions, doesn't prevent insurance companies from putting lifetime caps on how much they'll spend on a person with medical issues, and it cuts a huge amount of money, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars in health care funding. And Americans understandably, especially, do not like the idea of being priced out of insurance for a pre-existing condition. </q> <p>Kimmel used his network soapbox to show how many medical organizations are against the Graham-Cassidy proposal which prompted the Bill Cosby joke.</p> <p>"This plan is not a good thing," he argued. "[Cassidy's] supporters say, he's a doctor and you're not, what do you know? To them I say, all of these very reputable organizations -- American Diabetes Association, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, the list goes on and on. All of these groups populated by doctors say this health care bill is bad. They're against it. We haven't seen this many people come forward to speak against a bill since Cosby. Okay?"</p> <p>Kimmel also used his monologue to mock Vice President Mike Pence <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HliAn5OgmRQ" type="external">for arguing</a> that states should be able to decide what they want to do, in this case with health care.</p> <p>"Their argument that is it's better to put these decisions in the hands of the states. And have you seen some of our states? If Florida could make their own decisions, it would be legal to bring an alligator into a strip club," he joked.</p> <p>Kimmel used his monologue to call Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) an "inbred" after he said the host is a "funny guy," but no one should confuse him with a "well-respected health care expert."</p> <p>"I wouldn't take advice from Charlie Sheen either," Kennedy added.</p> <p>Kimmel said he feels like it is his "duty" to talk about health care. He reminded people who question his qualifications as a comedian that they voted for a man who fired people on television for a living. The host then implored viewers to call their Senators and tell them "not to gut American health care." Kimmel then provided the number to call Senators on screen.</p> <p>"I'm not pretending to be an expert, I'm asking why people like you aren't listening to actual experts like the American Medical Association," Kimmel told Kennedy. "I should not be the guy you go to for information on health care. And if these guys, like inbred John Kennedy, would tell the truth for a change, I wouldn't have to. I see these comments from these angry people, they say what qualifies you to talk about this stuff? You're a comedian, go back to being not funny. And I feel like it's my duty to remind these people, who are so concerned about my qualifications, the guy you voted for president?"</p> <p>From Thursday's monologue:</p> <q>
 JIMMY KIMMEL: So the president got involved last night via Twitter, of course. <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/910641701064204288" type="external">He wrote</a>, 'I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal &amp;amp; Replace.' Those are the key words: repeal and replace. Because for Donald Trump this isn't about the Graham-Cassidy bill, it's about getting rid of Obamacare, which he hates, primarily because Obama's name is on it. He likes to have his name on things. Buildings, vodka, you name it. And at this point, he would sign anything if it meant getting rid of Obamacare. He'd sign copies of the Koran at the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble in Fallujah if it meant he could get rid of Obamacare. </q></article>
	<article id="0001070" published-at="2017-12-15" title="California Lt. Gov Gavin Newsome to NRA: “We ARE Coming for Your Guns”"><p>California’s Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom decided to commemorate the tragic Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 by telling the NRA that if they hurt anybody else, they’re coming for their guns.</p> <p>Not would be criminals…but the NRA.</p> <p>“It’s been 5 years since 20 first graders were shot dead at Sandy Hook,” wrote Newsom on a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GavinNewsom/videos/vb.10128918116/10156117522448117/?type=2&amp;theater" type="external">Facebook post</a>.</p> <p>Newsome then listed off the mass shootings that have occurred since that time.</p> <q> <p>Since then: – 14 killed in San Bernardino – 49 killed in Orlando– 58 killed in Vegas– 26 killed in a Texas churchEnough.</p> </q> <p>“We have a message for the NRA – National Rifle Association of America: If you hurt people, we ARE coming for your guns,” wrote Newsome.</p> <p>The message was accompanied by a video featuring Newsome speaking on how the only thing more certain than another mass shooting is the “moral cowardice” of Republicans who ignore it.</p> <a type="internal"/> Trending <p>Newsome then mocked the idea of thoughts and prayers, saying Republicans hide behind them while “plugging their ears with NRA hush money.” Turning to a solution, Newsome bragged that California has passed “proposition 63” and will force “convicted violent felons” to give up their firearms.</p> <p>The video ends with Newsome saying voters need to tell Trump and Ryan to stop “praying for NRA dollars” and fix the gun laws. This is accompanied by a group of people picking up both politicians and manhandling them back into the capitol to presumably pass gun control laws.</p> <p>I’m not going to mince words here. This video and the accompanying message is flat out stupid. It paints innocents as criminals, and conveniently doesn’t go into just what kind of law was passed with Prop 63.</p> <p>For one, the NRA didn’t cause any of these mass shootings. None of the shooters that were involved were members of the NRA. Newsome’s warning that he would take away the NRA’s guns if they hurt anybody ever again is one of the most over-the-top and blatant lies ever leveled at the National Rifle Association.</p> <p>He also managed to leave out the fact that the Texas shooting was stopped by a former NRA instructor.</p> <p>Furthermore, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_63,_Background_Checks_for_Ammunition_Purchases_and_Large-Capacity_Ammunition_Magazine_Ban_(2016)" type="external">Prop 63’s purpose</a> was to add to the already asinine restrictions on gun owners by making arms dealers obtain a permit to simply sell ammunition, and run a background check on people buying it. It also requires Californian’s give up any magazine that can contain over 10 rounds. How that prevents criminals from hurting anyone is beyond me, seeing as how California has made obtaining a gun a difficult task, and yet criminals are still managing to get their hands on them.</p> <p>Once again, gun control politicians and advocates are punishing the law abiding for something the law defying did.</p> <p>Oh, and speaking of laws, CONVICTED VIOLENT CRIMINALS ARE ALREADY NOT ALLOWED TO OWN GUNS. This has been a federal law for decades, and yet the left seems to believe that criminals are walking into gun stores, and walking out with enough firepower to conquer a small nation. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563465/" type="external">This ban for felons also already includes ammunition</a>, making Prop 63 a useless gesture that trips up law abiding gun owners, and exposing it as Newsome’s try-hard attempt to get some cred with the gun control crowd for when he runs for a higher office than his own.</p> <p>Newsome says in the video that the “coming for your guns” bit was a warning to “criminals,” but with the guy blaming the NRA and gun owners as the culprits in mass shootings, I’d like to know what his definition of “criminal” is.</p> <p>In one Facebook post, Newsome…</p> <p>-Exposed either his ignorance about our nation’s gun laws or his willingness to lie about them.</p> <p>-Pegged an innocent gun rights organization and its members (millions on millions of people) for mass shootings they had nothing to do with</p> <p>-Mocked how people give condolences for tragic events that happen to them, specifically those of the religious variety</p> <p>-Accused Republicans of profiting off of the death of Americans with silence money given to them by the NRA</p> <p>-Stood on the graves of the slain to do it.</p> <p>Newsome’s video is one of the more weasely things I’ve seen in a while, and I write on Planned Parenthood’s PR attempts a lot.</p></article>
	<article id="0001071" published-at="2017-09-07" title="Roofing Contractor Leaves Job Half Done When He Finds Out What Evil Work Business Does!"><p>You just have to admire a business that puts principles first above profit. In Wichita, Kansas that is exactly what happened. An abortion clinic there needed a new roof. They couldn’t get any contractors to do the work because well… they’re baby butchers. So, what do you do when you can’t get a contractor to ignore that you do infanticide for a living? Why, you lie of course. They pretended to be a real estate firm and got a contractor to begin work.</p> <p>The roofing company got into the job, found out it was an abortion clinic and although they were out of pocket on materials and time, they packed up and walked off the job. Slow clap please. That’s a contractor I would hire in a heartbeat and pay extra for it. The roof was only half complete when they left and they didn’t look back once. No amount of money is worth helping a business that does evil work like that.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Farha Roofing found out about the true identity of the business thanks to Mark Gietzen and the Kansas Coalition For Life. The roofing company was reluctant to pull out because of the expense, but after enough complaints via phone calls, they packed it in and called it a loss. Inexplicably, they left foam insulation on pallets there as they left.</p> <p>The abortion business has had to go out of town and out of state to get help from plumbers and electricians. It may be a very long time before that roof gets finished. Good. Gietzen plans to send letters to all the surrounding businesses to warn them that the abortion mill lies in order to retain contractors.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>It’s pretty obvious that Wichita does not take kindly to abortion clinics. And if you have to lie to get people to help you, you are in the wrong business. Abortionists murder over 900,000 babies a year. It’s genocide and it is deeply depraved and evil. Abortion is not simply another form of birth control. It is the knowing murder of another human being. They tear apart babies who are innocent souls and cannot protect themselves.</p> <p>Anyone who is against abortion should not have to take a job that helps them or promotes them, regardless of your religion. In my view, abortion is monstrous… it’s not only immoral and unethical, it is literally sacrificing babies on a bloody altar for profit. I applaud this roofing company for doing the right thing here and walking away. That building doesn’t need to be repaired… it should be demolished.</p> <a type="internal"/></article>

	<article id="0001081" published-at="2018-05-27" title="Fox News guest says that the only problem with missing 1,500 immigrant children is that America can't deport them"><q> <p>GRIFF JENKINS (CO-HOST): What is this about the government lost 1500 migrant children?</p> <p>MARK KRIKORIAN (EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES): What it means is that when these unaccompanied minors -- this is people who came over, that were smuggled here by their parents but they came supposedly on their own, they were handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services, which takes care of this, and then they were placed with their illegal immigrant relatives in the United States at tax payer expense. What this number represents is that 30 days afterwards the social workers at Health and Human Services try to call up on the phone and say, you know, "How are things going?" And this number of people, 1400-something of them, they couldn't get in touch with. They didn't return the phone calls or they lied about what their phone numbers are, or they moved, something like that. And this is exactly the same thing that happened under Obama. We released a report on this a year and a half ago and there was nothing, no, crickets, because the problem here is not that some 4-year-old is wandering the streets in the middle of the night. Nothing like that is happening. The problem here is that the government has no idea where they are, therefore they're never going to show up for their hearings and they're here illegally, permanently. Under Obama that was a good thing, so it never got any news coverage. Now they're saying, "Oh my God, Trump lost kids." Now it's news.</p> <p>JENKINS: It's interesting, Mark. So, is it your sense then that this has become political? It appears, if you look at Twitter and media outlets and really some stars, Alyssa Milano and some others tweeting that this is unbelievable, that this has now happened. Comparing it in some cases as if it were the terrible story of the Boko Haram girls, being kidnapped for the purposes of being terrorist's wives. Is this is same thing or is this just a politicization of the story?</p> <p>KRIKORIAN: Yeah, this is a classic propaganda operation. I think it probably sort of happened by accident. Nobody planned it. But this is the way that propaganda works. You take a fact that's real, a kernel of truth, and then you twist it and manipulate it in such a way that's going to resonate with the target population you're trying to manipulate. This is, there's no question there are actually a handful of people probably, who were, of these young people, who were put in some kind of bad situation. That's entirely possible. But the bulk of this problem is that these illegal immigrants are on the run and the relatives that they were placed with don't want to talk with the government. That's why we can't get in touch with them.</p> <p>JENKINS: Right, Mark, very quickly because we're almost out of time. For the practical viewers, are these kids missing?</p> <p>KRIKORIAN: No, they are not missing. They are missing as far as the immigration system is concerned. And the point of that is they basically, we're never going to find them to return them to their own countries. That's the problem, it's not that they're on a milk carton somewhere.</p> </q> <p>Related:</p> <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/us/politics/migrant-children-missing.html" type="external">New York Times: Federal Agencies Lost Track of Nearly 1,500 Migrant Children Placed With Sponsors</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/trump-blames-his-own-child-separation-policy-on-democrats" type="external">Vanity Fair: Trump blames his own cruel child-separation policy on Democrats</a></p> <p>Previously:</p> <p><a type="internal">ICE is wrongly designating immigrants as gang members to deport them -- and conservatives are thrilled</a></p></article>

"The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed wall at the Southern Border and an end to the horrible Chain Migration and ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc," Trump tweeted on Friday.</p> <p>"We must protect our Country at all cost!" Trump's declaration casts doubt over how Democrats and Republicans will come together to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) participants, of which there are nearly 800,000 who were brought to the United States illegal as children, from deportation because it is unlikely that Democrats will agree to substantial funding for Trump's border wall in exchange for DACA protections, CNN reported.</p> <p>Drew Hammill, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's spokesman, responded to Trump's tweet late Friday by stating that Democrats were "not going to negotiate through the press and look forward to a serious negotiation at Wednesday's (January 3) meeting when we come back". Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly will meet on January 3.</p> <p>The top discussion topic will be renewed government spending talks. Trump's tweet is his clearest statement to date on his negotiating position with Democrats to achieve a deal on DACA, programmme launched by former President Barack Obama that Trump ended in September. Trump has demanded that funding for the border wall would need to be part of any deal, but it remains unclear how far he would be willing to go to protect DACA recipients. Earlier this year, the President had said that his administration was not looking at "citizenship" or "amnesty" but that they are "looking at allowing people to stay here".</p> <p><a type="internal">Catch up on all the latest Mumbai news, current affairs from Mumbai, local news, crime news and breaking headlines here</a></p> <p>Download the new mid-day <a href="https://goo.gl/8Xlcvr" type="external">Android</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/KQziH4" type="external">iOS</a> apps to get updates on all the latest and trending stories on the go</p></article>
	<article id="0001083" published-at="2018-04-05" title="If Democrats Win Big in November">
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at a Capitol Hill news conference, March 22, 2018. <p>Pelosi and Schumer could cripple Trump’s deregulatory agenda, stymie Supreme Court picks, and focus on impeachment.</p> <p>‘I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party — and please let Cryin’ Chuck stay!”</p> <p>So tweeted a bullish President Trump last summer after Democrats lost a congressional special election in Georgia they had hoped to win. He got his wish: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are still in charge of their party on Capitol Hill. Now these two political veterans are leading the drive for a Democratic takeover of Congress this fall.</p> <p>What if they succeed? What if they manage to switch out the “Minority” in their titles to “Majority”? What can America expect?</p> <p>In a word: obstructionism — on an unprecedented scale.</p> <p>A few months ago, conservatives were calling Pelosi and Schumer “do-nothing Democrats” for refusing to sit down with the president to negotiate a budget to keep the government open. That was just a warm-up act for the obstructionism to come if they get control of one or both houses of Congress.</p> <p>Here are five things we can expect if the Dems win big in the midterm elections.</p> <p>1) We will get no new conservative or constitutionalist judges.</p> <p>Should a Supreme Court vacancy arise in the next two years, Democrats will make sure it has zero chance of being filled. They will see it as payback for the Senate Republican blockade of President Obama’s nominee to fill the vacancy left by Justice Scalia’s death.</p> <p>But they won’t stop there. Democrats will also refuse to confirm any lower-court nominees they don’t care for — and that will be most of them. The Trump administration, working closely with Senate Republicans, has been remaking the federal courts, shifting away from judicial activism and toward an emphasis on the rule of law. If Democrats succeed this November, that process will grind to a halt.</p> <p>2) No substantive legislation will be approved.</p> <p>Despite being briefly courted by President Trump, Schumer and Pelosi have shown little interest in “doing deals” with him. If they get control of either House of Congress, they will probably put off major legislative priorities until 2021 — when they hope one of their own will occupy the White House. And if they make any exceptions to cutting deals with Trump, the bills they put on his desk will not be to the liking of conservatives.</p> <p>3) House and Senate committees will be militantly focused on investigations and oversight.</p> <p>If Democrats get their hands on the gavels of congressional committees, they will spend little time on productive legislating — why give President Trump any bipartisan accomplishments? Instead, they will devote their power and resources to methodically investigating the president, his staff, and his agency appointees.</p> <q> <p>Entrenched bureaucrats (some of them Obama appointees who burrowed into career positions) will effectively be put in control. The president’s own appointees in each agency will be undermined from within.</p> </q> <p>This will result in near-paralysis for the administration. Rather than working on the president’s agenda, the already-thin political leadership in the federal agencies will find itself under siege from Capitol Hill. Agency leaders will be constantly on defense, parrying committee document requests, subpoenas, and congressionally instigated inspector-general investigations. Executive-branch efforts to advance a right-of-center agenda will feel like trying to organize a softball league at Verdun.</p> <p>4) Executive-branch confirmations will slow to a trickle.</p> <p>Senate Democrats have already perfected the art of using every procedural trick in the book to slow the confirmation process and keep the federal government understaffed. If Democrats pick up a majority of Senate seats, expect them to double down on this strategy. If they allow an occasional nominee to get through, they will extract steep policy concessions and other tradeoffs in return.</p> <p>The result? Entrenched bureaucrats (some of them Obama appointees who burrowed into career positions) will effectively be put in control. The president’s own appointees in each agency will be undermined from within as they try to implement his policies.</p> <p>5) Democrats will use legislation to block Trump’s deregulatory agenda.</p> <p>One of President Trump’s signature accomplishments has been a robust program of deregulation aimed at promoting economic growth. Most of that has been implemented by executive action, but Democrats would have the power to stymie the president’s deregulatory agenda if they seized control of one or both Houses of Congress.</p> <p>Their most effective weapon would be riders to appropriations bills that would deny the funding needed to carry out new Trump-era rules — rules that most Democrats in Congress don’t like. President Trump could certainly veto such bills. However, he would eventually be forced into a government-shutdown scenario. Trump may judge that worth the risk, but Democrats could keep his deregulatory priorities in limbo for the duration.</p> <p>If Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer get a fresh taste of power after the midterms, they won’t be thinking about the dangers of overreaching. But those dangers are real. Donald Trump pulled off an astonishing victory in 2016 because voters were tired of business as usual in Washington and wanted real change. The Democrats will be bullied by their far-left base to shut down President Trump’s audacious agenda and even attempt to impeach him. If they do, not only could their midterm gains be short-lived, but they may even help boost the reelection of a president they loathe.</p> <a type="internal">Steven Law</a> — Steven Law is the president of the Senate Leadership Fund and American Crossroads and was deputy secretary of labor under President George W.

	<article id="0001084" published-at="2018-01-10" title="We got a glimpse of Trump negotiating. It didn’t go well.">
President Donald Trump during a meeting with bipartisan members of Congress on immigration on Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2018. Photo Credit: Bloomberg / Andrew Harrer <p>White House officials made the unusual decision Tuesday to allow cameras to film a nearly hourlong immigration meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers. They probably wish they hadn’t.</p> <p>For a moment, Democrats thought they had struck an unexpected deal with President Donald Trump. Trump had previously insisted that any deal protecting “dreamers” - undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children - should also include border security and/or a border wall. But he now says that he would support a “clean” bill protecting dreamers, and then take up comprehensive immigration reform later.</p> <p>“What about a clean DACA bill now and a commitment to do comprehensive next?” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Trump responded: “Yeah, I would like to do that. I think a lot of people would like to see that.”</p> <p>The problem? Trump didn’t know what “clean DACA bill” meant. Republicans quickly interjected and made clear that Trump believes a “clean” bill would include border security. Except that’s not at all what a clean bill is; that’s a compromise bill. A clean bill only has one component to it and doesn’t include multiple elements, which could muddy it.</p> <p>By the end, Trump sought to clarify things. “I think a clean DACA bill, to me, is a DACA bill, but we take care of the 800,000 people,” he said. “But I think, to me, a clean bill is a bill of DACA - we take care of them, and we also take care of security.”</p> <p>If anything, the whole mess showed pretty vividly just how utterly disengaged Trump is in the finer details of policy discussions. Which is exactly the perception that he has recently fought against.</p> <p>Asked by The New York Times late last month about this perception, Trump bristled. “I know the details of taxes better than anybody - better than the greatest CPA,” he said. “I know the details of health care better than most, better than most.”</p> Sign up for The Point <p>Go inside New York politics.</p> <p>By clicking Sign up, you agree to our <a type="internal">privacy policy</a>.</p> <p>The problem is that every public indication gives us the opposite impression. Trump almost continually moves the goal posts on what he wants, shifts the terms of the debate and misstates what’s actually contained in the legislation that is before Congress.</p> <p>Even by the end of the meeting, Trump seemed to indicate that the border wall isn’t necessarily a must-have for him - becoming just the latest iteration in a dizzying series of back-and-forths on what he wants in a DACA deal.</p> <p>“My position will be what the people in this room come up with,” Trump said. He added later: “I’m not going to say, ‘Oh, gee, I want this,’ or ‘I want that.’ I will be signing it.”</p> <p>OK, so you’re no longer demanding the border wall or even border security, then?</p> <p>If you are a Democrat hearing those words, it’s pretty clear Trump isn’t wedded to his position on, well, anything. The border wall seems more like an opening bid. If Trump has shown us anything, it’s that he just wants to sign bills and make sure the base doesn’t hate him for it. So as long as he can plausibly say he fought the good fight for the border wall - even if he didn’t - it seems he’s ready to just get it over with and claim a legislative win.</p> <p>Which is generally OK. Presidents needn’t dirty their hands with all of the sausage-making that happens on Pennsylvania Avenue. Congress produces the bills, and the president decides whether to sign them.</p> <p>But Trump has repeatedly assured us that he knows this stuff better than almost anyone and that he’s the world’s pre-eminent negotiator. What we saw Tuesday was neither of those things.</p> <p>Aaron Blake is senior political reporter for The Fix.</p></article>

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (Rex Features/AP) <p>Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Tuesday slammed columnist Tom Friedman's call for former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama to come together because a "constitutional crisis" from the Russia probe will engulf President Donald Trump.</p> <p>"Tom is another one of these geniuses who predicted Trump would never run — and on Election Day predicted in The New York Times that Hillary Clinton was going to get 340 electoral votes," Lewandowski, chief strategist for American First Action, told <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/show/story-martha-maccallum" type="external">Fox News host Martha MacCallum</a>.</p> <p>"And Donald Trump was on his way to the largest defeat in modern election history."</p> Alzheimer's-Blocking "Super Coffee" May Be The "Memory Saving Discovery" Of The Century <p>Friedman told <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe" type="external">MSNBC's "Morning Joe"</a> that Bush and Obama have remained silent despite Trump's attacks because "they understand they are going to have to come together in the face of this constitutional crisis that's in our future and stand up for the Constitution.</p> <p>"It's going to have to be done in a bipartisan way by two ex-presidents, who I think still have a lot of credibility, and my guess is they are saving their power for that," he said.</p> <p>But Lewandowski retorted: "What is a Constitutional crisis? The lowest unemployment rate ever recorded?</p> <p>"A stock market that continues to go up? Cutting taxes for Americans and businesses?</p> <p>"What is the Constitutional crisis?" he asked again. "Putting America first?</p> <p>"The crisis is that we are not globalists anymore. We are unapologetic to be Americans.</p> <p>"This president has said we're not here to be the protectors of the rest of the world and will protect our own people first," Lewandowski said.</p> <p>"If that's a Constitutional crisis that he think is in front of us, then he is absolutely right.</p> <p>"This president is here to protect Americans."</p></article>

This supported wider research that shows a majority of Muslims simply <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/" type="external">do not hold radical views</a>.</p> <p>However, within a small minority, the survey showed that a feeling of marginalisation and discrimination could predict feelings of insignificance – which in turn increased people's attraction to fundamentalist groups and their extreme behaviour.</p> <p>According to Lyons-Padilla, the findings back up the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/news/dr-arie-kruglanski-discusses-psychology-behind-terrorist-recruitment" type="external">work of researcher Arie Kruglanksi</a> from Maryland University, who has previously explored the psychological motivations of terrorists.</p> <p>"Kruglanski [proposed] a particularly compelling theory: people become terrorists to restore a sense of significance in their lives, a feeling that they matter," Lyons-Padilla explained for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/radicalisation-islamophobia-orlando-shooting-florida-muslims-trump" type="external">The Guardian</a> in an opinion piece last year.</p> <p>"Extremist organisations like Isis are experts at giving their recruits that sense of purpose, through status, recognition, and the promise of eternal rewards in the afterlife."</p> <p>To help counter the threat of extremist organisations, Lyons-Padilla argues that we need to diminish their appeal in the eyes of marginalised immigrants – and the first step in doing so is by not making them feel unwelcome and unappreciated in their adopted homelands.</p> <p>In contrast, things like anti-Islam rhetoric, bans on Muslims travelling, and increased policing and monitoring of Muslim communities won't actually curb extremism – they'll just help enable it.</p> <p>"According to my research, this is the recipe for making American Muslims feel disenfranchised and discriminated against," <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/13/radicalisation-islamophobia-orlando-shooting-florida-muslims-trump" type="external">Lyons-Padilla writes</a>.</p> <p>"We are actually planting the seeds for radicalisation and essentially helping Isis recruit by fuelling the narrative that the west is anti-Islam."</p> <p>In a separate, complementary survey that looked at the experience of 204 German Muslim immigrants – in addition to the US cohort – the researchers found that those living in the US were having an easier time integrating into US culture than their counterparts in Germany.</p> <p>The team attributes this to the US having a comparatively <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/08/discrimination-radicalization.aspx" type="external">"looser"</a> culture than Germany's more conformity-based society, which the researchers think could also influence people's susceptibility to radicalisation.</p> <p>The <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-warmer-embrace-of-muslims-could-stop-homegrown-terrorism-50869" type="external">preliminary findings</a> of that study are still undergoing peer review, but Lyons-Padilla thinks it shows more evidence that openness to diversity is needed to stop disenfranchised immigrants from becoming <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-warmer-embrace-of-muslims-could-stop-homegrown-terrorism-50869" type="external">"culturally homeless"</a>.</p> <p>In the researchers' view, it's not just about Islamophobia being hurtful and morally wrong. By being accepting and promoting inclusivity wherever we can, we're likely to be sowing the foundations for a more secure society – not just a fairer, better one.</p> <p>"We can make it harder for terrorists to recruit by making the culturally homeless feel more at home," <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2016/03/17/terrorism-muslims-inclusion-031716/" type="external">Lyons-Padilla explains</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="http://apps.apa.org/convsearch/article.aspx?id=5104&amp;type=abstract&amp;_ga=2.214698839.1343381952.1500906241-25438525.1490299103" type="external">findings</a> were presented at the American Psychological Association's 125th <a href="https://www.apa.org/convention/index.aspx" type="external">Annual Convention</a> in Washington last week.</p> <a type="internal"/></article>
	<article id="0001089" title="An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge">
Symbolism, Imagery, Allegory <p>Time, it seems, is not on Farquhar's side. He's out of time when the story begins, his watch ticking down the seconds to his death. The jig, as they say, was up before it began – Farquhar's plan to burn down the bridge was pre-planned by a Federal scout.</p> <p>The strange flow of time throughout the narrative only highlights this point. The narrator takes us back and forth between the present and the past. In fact, it is only after Farquhar falls through the bridge that we learn his name and what led him to his execution. This non-linear flow of time reflects Farquhar's lack of control over the course of events.</p> <p>Farquhar's lack of control over time and the limited time left in his life are very evident in his reaction to the ticking of his watch. The watch ticks off the seconds left in Farquhar's life like a "death knell" (1.5), a bell rung to announce that someone has died. As he hears his watch ticking, he knows he can't control the time that is passing. Instead, his mind creates an alternative reality, one in which he escapes.</p> <p>One last note on time: if you think about it, most of this story takes place over the course of just a few seconds – an interesting and challenging narrative technique, we'd say.</p></article>

	<article id="0001098" published-at="2017-10-12" title="Rose McGowan's Temporary Twitter Lock-Out Inspires #WomenBoycottTwitter Movement"><p><a type="internal">Rose McGowan</a> was one of the women who shared her story in The New York Times's initial report last week about the decades of <a type="internal">sexual abuse allegations</a> against Harvey Weinstein. Since then, the actress has stayed vocal on Twitter, sharing her support for the other women who have accused Weinstein and other powerful men of sexual harassment and assault. Early Thursday morning, however, Twitter <a type="internal">partially suspended her account</a>, infuriating McGowan and other supporters of victims of sexual violence. This happened after Rose had tweeted several times this week about Weinstein and about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/12/rose-mcgowan-twitter-suspended-ben-affleck-harvey-weinstein" type="external">Ben Affleck</a>.</p> <p>McGowan shared the news of her suspension on Instagram early Thursday morning, posting a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaImG1Mle7b/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=rosemcgowan" type="external">screenshot</a> of the message she had received from Twitter alerting her to the suspension and asking her to "delete Tweets that violate our rules." "TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE. #ROSEARMY #whywomendontreport," she captioned the photo.</p> <p>Countless people took to Twitter to express their outrage over what some thought to be an attempt by the social media platform to silence women <a type="internal">speaking out against alleged abuse</a>, while allowing powerful men's spewing of hate and violence to go unchecked. As one user summed it up, "Jemele Hill gets suspended. Rose McGowan gets suspended. Trump spews hate daily and nada. Notice a pattern here? Silencing women!"</p> <p>Other Twitter users have since devised a plan to boycott Twitter on Friday, October 13, in support of women like McGowan who have been silenced for sharing their experiences. The "WomenBoycottTwitter" hashtag was trending on Thursday, with one user pointing out, "Looks like we've got the day off tomorrow, feminists."</p> <p>For its part, Twitter released a statement on Thursday explaining its decision to temporarily suspend Rose's account. "We have been in touch with Ms. McGowan's team. We want to explain that her account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service. The Tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked. We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future," the tweeted statement read. "Twitter is proud to empower and support the voices on our platform, especially those that speak truth to power. We stand with the brave women and men who use Twitter to share their stories, and will work hard every day to improve our processes to protect those voices." Teen Vogue has reached out to Twitter for further comment; this post will be updated with their response.</p></article>
	<article id="0001099" published-at="2015-09-22" title="How ISIS Got Its Flag">
An Iraqi Shiite militiaman prays next to a wall painted with the black flag used by ISIS. <p>On an August morning in 2014, someone noticed a black flag hanging outside a rundown duplex in suburban New Jersey. He could not make out its Arabic, but he recognized the design from horrific news reports about ISIS, in which masked jihadists fought under the banner to realize their dark vision of God’s rule on earth. Alarmed, the passerby sent a picture of the house and its flag to a friend, who promptly tweeted it and informed the Department of Homeland Security.</p> <p>The flag’s owner, Mark Dunaway, had converted to Islam a decade prior, he explained to the police when they arrived, and he flew the flag to mark Muslim holidays. “Every Muslim uses that black flag,” he said. “You’ll find it in any mosque in the world.” Still, he took it down. “I understand now that people turn on CNN and see the flag associated with jihad, but that’s not the intention … at all. It says, ‘There is only one god, Allah, and the prophet Mohammed is his messenger.’ It’s not meant to be a symbol of hate.” Dunaway, like many Muslims and even Middle East experts, did not know that the flag had been designed by ISIS in 2006. He and others were confused because the Islamic State had used terror and Twitter to advertise its brand, and Islamic tradition to obscure its meaning.</p> <p>Before the group declared itself the caliphate reborn that summer, it had been ambiguous about the flag’s meaning and the cause it represented. Was it the flag of an Islamic state, or the flag of the Islamic state—the caliphate that had once ruled land from Spain to Iran and whose prophesied return would herald the end of the world? The Islamic State encouraged the second interpretation but let the global community of jihadists read into the flag and the “state” what they would. The group’s cause proved so compelling among jihadists that in 2014 the organization supplanted its former master, al-Qaeda. The spread of the flag, then, traces the spread of an idea and chronicles a major changing of the guard in the global jihadist movement.</p> ISIS Flag (Wikimedia) <p>When the Islamic State first announced itself on October 15, 2006, it had no flag of its own. It was not until January 2007 that al-Qaeda’s media distribution arm, al-Fajr, released a picture of the Islamic State’s new flag. Anonymous authors affiliated with the Islamic State <a href="https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/a-religious-essay-explaining-the-significance-of-the-banner-in-islam-english-translation-2" type="external">explained</a> its design, quoting passages from Islamic scripture and historical accounts. “The flag of the prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is a black square made of striped wool,” according to one account. Another describes Mohammed “standing on the pulpit preaching” surrounded by fluttering black flags. “On the flag of the prophet was written, ‘No god but God, and Mohammed is the Messenger of God.’” The flag even had a name: “the eagle.”</p> <p>Although the authors acknowledged other reports of green, white, and yellow flags, they concluded the Islamic State’s flag would be black, because most of the reports about Mohammed mentioned a black flag. The authors were equally confident when explaining the banner’s text. “What is written on the flag is what is written on the flag of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him.”</p> <p>The Islamic State’s design of the Muslim profession of faith is different from every other attempt to replicate the prophet’s flag: “No god but God” is scrawled in white across the top and “Mohammed is the Messenger of God” is stacked in black inside a white circle. As the anonymous authors noted, they took the circle’s design from a seal of the prophet used on a set of letters, now housed in Turkey’s Topkapi Palace, that were supposedly written on Mohammed’s behalf. (Modern scholars doubt the letters’ authenticity.) We are meant to believe the Islamic State had inherited the prophet’s seal, just as the early caliphs had.</p> <p>Why make a flag? In addition to following the prophet’s example, the Islamic State wanted a symbol to rally people to its cause. The group quoted a 19th-century Ottoman historian and official, Ahmad Cevdet Pasha, to make the point:</p> <q> <p>The secret in creating a flag is that it gathers people under a single banner to unify them, meaning that this flag is a sign of the coming together of their words and a proof of the unity of their hearts. They are like a single body and what knits them together is stronger than the bond of blood relatives.</p> </q> <p>Yet the Islamic State’s choices display the modern sensibilities they try so hard to displace. The white scrawl across the top, “No god but God,” is deliberately ragged, meant to suggest an era before the precision of Photoshop, even though the flag was designed on a computer. Even the Islamic State’s quotation of Ahmad Cevdet Pasha unwittingly betrays a modern perspective. Influenced by European notions of nationalism yet desiring to hold together the multiethnic Ottoman Empire under sovereign Turkish rule, Cevdet Pasha imagined Islam and its symbols to be the glue. “The only thing uniting Arab, Kurd, Albanian, and Bosnian is the unity of Islam,” he said, according to Dominic Lieven’s book Empire: The Russian Empire and its Rivals. “Yet the real strength of the Sublime State lies with the Turks.”</p> <p>The Islamic State ended the explanation of its flag’s design with a prayer: “We ask God, praised be He, to make this flag the sole flag for all Muslims. We are certain that it will be the flag of the people of Iraq when they go to aid … the Mahdi at the holy house of God.” The house of God is the Kaaba in Mecca, the holiest shrine in Islam, and the Mahdi is the savior who Muslims believe will appear there in the years leading up to the apocalypse. The Islamic State was signaling that its flag was not only the symbol of its government and the herald of a future caliphate; it was the harbinger of the final battle at the End of Days.</p> <p>Legends of the black flag and the Muslim savior, the Mahdi, first circulated during the reign of the Umayyad dynasty, which ruled the Islamic empire from Damascus in the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. The dynasty’s founders, the Umayya clan, had seized the caliphate from Mohammed’s son-in-law and grandsons, which infuriated many Muslims. People unhappy with Umayyad rule circulated prophecies of a man of the prophet’s family who would return justice to the world. They called the man the Mahdi, Arabic for “the Rightly Guided One.” Many of the prophecies envision the Mahdi appearing during the End of Days to lead the final battles against the infidels.</p> <p>Like most Islamic prophecies of the End of Days, those about the Mahdi are not found in the preeminent scripture of Islam, the Koran, which Muslims believe preserves God’s revelation to Mohammed, but rather in the voluminous compendia of the words and deeds of the prophet and his companions, known as hadith, which were written down decades or even centuries after the prophet’s death. Muslims argue over the veracity of individual hadith, and the contradictions between them, the way some Christians debate the reliability of the Gospels and their discrepancies.</p> <p>End-Time prophecies were an especially inviting target for fabricators. In the internecine wars that tore apart the early Muslim community, each side sought to justify its politics by predicting its inevitable victory and the other side’s preordained defeat. Prophecies proliferated, reaching into the thousands. When the politics evaporated, the prophetic residue remained.</p> <p>Supporters of the prophet’s family loosely aligned themselves as part of what historians call the Hashemite movement, which believed the Mahdi would be a descendent of Mohammed’s great-grandfather, Hashem. Many of the movement’s supporters were from Iran, where Zoroastrian legends prophesied the coming of a club-wielding savior who would appear at the End of Time followed by sable-clad disciples. Influenced by the prophecies, the revolutionaries donned black clothes, flew black flags, and carried around wooden clubs called “infidel-bashers.”</p> <p>As the revolutionaries built support for their cause, they circulated prophecies of soldiers fighting under black flags who would come from the East to overthrow the Umayyads. Some were put in the mouth of Mohammed’s son-in-law, Ali, who allegedly foretold the coming of an army from Khorasan, the “land of the rising sun” that includes parts of eastern Iran and most of Afghanistan. Other black-flag prophecies were attributed to the prophet himself. “If you see the black banners coming from Khorasan,” instructs one, “go to them immediately even if you must crawl over ice because indeed among them is the caliph, al-Mahdi.”</p> <p>In early Islam, the color black was associated not just with mourning but also with revenge for a wrongful death. According to the historian Ibn Khaldun, the opponents of the Umayyads adopted black as their color to avenge the Umayyads’ persecution of the prophet’s family. Black flags were also flown by the prophet in his war with the infidels. “Do not flee with [the flag] from the infidels and do not fight with it against the Muslims,” Mohammed reportedly told one of his generals.</p> <p>Apocalyptic messages resonate among many Muslims today because of the political turmoil in the Middle East. In 2012, <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-3-articles-of-faith/" type="external">half</a> of all Muslims in North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia expected the imminent appearance of the Mahdi. And why wouldn’t they, given the revolutions sweeping the Arab world? The signs that herald his coming have only multiplied since. A great sectarian war tears Syria asunder. Iraq is in chaos. The “infidel” West has invaded. The “tribulations” are too awful and apparent to brook mundane explanations.</p> <p>This article has been adapted from William McCants’s new book, <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250080905" type="external">The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State</a>.</p> <p>We want to hear what you think about this article. <a type="internal">Submit a letter</a> to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.</p></article>
	<article id="0001100" published-at="2018-01-06" title="Donald Trump Goes Full Fredo"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001030/mediaviewer/rm1717968640" type="external">Paramount Pictures / IMDB</a> <p>“I can handle things. I’m smart! Not like everybody says, like dumb. I’m smart and I want respect!”</p> <p>This morning’s presidential Twitter outburst recalls those words of Fredo Corleone’s in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg8jODlrka0" type="external">one of the most famous scenes</a> from The Godfather series. Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949618475877765120" type="external">tweeted</a> that his “two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart,” and in <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949619270631256064" type="external">a subsequent tweet</a> called himself a “very stable genius.”</p> <p>Trump may imagine that he’s Michael Corleone, the tough and canny rightful heir—or even Sonny Corleone, the terrifyingly violent but at least powerful heir apparent—but after today he is Fredo forever.</p> <p>There’s a key difference between film and reality, though: The Corleone family had the awareness and vigilance to exclude Fredo from power. The American political system did not do so well.</p> <p>Michael Wolff’s scathing new book about the Trump White House has sent President Trump spiraling into the most publicly visible meltdown of his presidency. Until now, Trump’s worst moments have occurred behind closed doors, and have become known to the public only second-hand, leaked by worried officials, aides, and advisers. Yesterday and today, we have seen a Trump temper tantrum in real time on Twitter, extended over hours, punctuated only by stretch of fitful presidential sleep. Trump’s <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/949498795074736129" type="external">tweets yesterday</a> focused largely on the blockbuster Wolff book, Fire and Fury.</p> <p>It may not be the newsiest—arguably it is the least newsy—but the most important moment in Wolff’s book are words attributed at second or third-hand to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the time of Donald Trump’s election. “He will sign anything we put in front of him.”</p> <p>Who and what Donald Trump is has been known to everyone and anyone who cared to know for years and decades. Before he was president, he was the country’s leading racist conspiracy theorist. Before he was the country’s leading racist conspiracy theorist, he was a celebrity gameshow host. Before he was a celebrity gameshow host, he was the multi-bankrupt least trusted name in real estate. Before he was the multi-bankrupt least trusted name in real estate, he was the protege of Roy Cohn’s repeatedly accused of ties to organized crime. From the start, Donald Trump was a man of many secrets, but no mysteries. Inscribed indelibly on the public record were the reasons for responsible people to do everything in their power to bar him from the presidency.</p> <p>Instead, since he announced his candidacy in mid-2015, Donald Trump has been enabled and protected.</p> <p>The enabling and protecting not only continues. It accelerates.</p> <p>Before the Saturday morning tweets, what should have been the biggest story of the week was Trump’s success at mobilizing the Senate and the FBI to deploy criminal prosecution as a weapon against Trump critics. The Senate Judiciary committee—the Senate Judiciary Committee! The committee that oversees the proper enforcement of the law!—formally filed a criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous dossier about Trump’s Russia connections. The referral was signed by the committee’s chairman, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, without even notice to Democrats on the committee, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/05/trump-dossier-author-steele-fbi-326613" type="external">Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said</a>; a startling abuse of majority status and a sharp departure from the norms of the Senate, especially a 51-49 Senate.</p> <p>The Department of Justice can ignore such a referral. It’s ominous, however, that on the very same day, the FBI obeyed Trump’s repeated demands and reopened a long-closed criminal investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The FBI has come under relentless abuse from Trump, who complains about its refusal to do his will. Is it now yielding?</p> <p>We also learned this week from The New York Times that aides to the attorney general <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-mcgahn.html" type="external">sought damaging information</a> on Capitol Hill about FBI Director Comey, indicating close cooperation between the White House and Main Justice to exert political control over the country’s chief law-enforcement agency.</p> <p>Michael Wolff has drawn the most indelible picture yet of Donald Trump, the man. But the important thing about Trump is not the man; it’s the system of power surrounding the man.</p> <p>In 2016, there were voters who genuinely, in good faith, believed that Donald Trump was a capable business leader, moderate on social issues, who cared about the troubles of working class white America—and would do something to help. There may well still be some people who believe this—but nowhere near enough to sustain a presidency.</p> <p>What sustains Trump now is the support of people who know what he is, but back him anyway. Republican political elites who know him for what he is, but who back him because they believe they can control and use him; conservative-media elites who sense what he is, but who delight in the culture wars he provokes; rank-and-file conservatives who care more about their grievances and hatreds than the governance of the country.</p> <p>After the Trump pardon of Sheriff Arpaio for obstruction of justice, a popular conservative blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtschlichter/status/901258810966200320?lang=en" type="external">tweeted</a> this justification of the president’s shocking attack on the rule of law: “The main reason for President Trump to pardon Sheriff Joe was fuck you, leftists. The new rules, bitches. &#128526; ”</p> <p>However crazy Trump may be, in one way he is indeed the “very stable genius” he claims to be: Trump understands how to mobilize hatred and resentment to his own advantage and profit. He has risen higher than Joe McCarthy or Charles Lindbergh or Theodore Bilbo—and he has lasted already nearly a full year in office, holding the approval of one-third of the country, more than sufficient to keep him there for a full term.</p> <p>Michael Wolff has done a crucial service, showing more intimately than any reporter yet the true nature of the man at the center of the American system. But without the complicity of other power-holders, Trump would drop from his central position like a tooth from a rotten gum. What we need to do now is widen the camera angle beyond Fredo Trump to the hard-faced men and women over his shoulders. Those are the people who put Trump where he is, and keep him there, corrupting the institutions of American democracy and troubling the peace and security of the world.</p> <p>We want to hear what you think about this article. <a type="internal">Submit a letter</a> to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.</p></article>

I voted for that party, I associate with that party, and I have agreed with (most of) the office’s decisions that came after Trump’s inauguration - I still do.</p> <p>No compatible source was found for this video.</p> However, it makes me sick to see some people take their “rights” too far. <p>And those are (some of) the people that I used to relate myself with. However, in this moment in time, I would give anything to not belong to that group - just for the sake of the reputation that they’re foolishly giving themselves - and the people that call themselves conservatives but don’t act out like this.</p> <p>If this party didn’t already lose enough respect, they certainly lost it all now. In most of the world, the republican party has already been anything but respected. But now, it’s like they dug a hole for themselves and, as conservatives, are shoveling the dirt right on top of them.</p> <p>Thanks to this hideous outrage coming from white supremacists, the conservative name is being dragged through the mud. Because of that, it will take a very long time to gain the respect of the people identifying with that party - even if they’re nothing like the people torching, chanting, and hating. And, because of that, people like me (and other people who belong to this party) are included in the thought that we must think that hatred, too.</p> <p>It's sad to realize that prejudice is still alive and well. In fact, it's more active now than it has been in a long time. Unfortunately, for some people, it took a dangerous and destructive for some people to recognize that.</p> <p>I am appalled at the actions being taken because of a difference of opinions.

Content originally published at iBankCoin.com <p>Following two weeks of excitement involving WikiLeaks, journalist Cassandra Fairbanks took to Twitter to implore President Trump to issue a preemptive pardon to founder Julian Assange - whose Twitter account was <a type="internal">mysteriously deactivated</a> for several hours on Christmas, several days after a WikiLeaks attorney's office was broken into.</p> <p>Sporting an "I'm with WikiLeaks" top like the one <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/817022546969329664" type="external">she wore to a January Senate hearing</a> on hacking, Fairbanks begins her plea which was Retweeted by both official WikiLeaks accounts, by reminding people that the US has never filed any formal charges against Julian Assange:</p> <q> <p>"I think that we should be pressuring Donald Trump to do more to help Julian Assange. It's probably one of the most important things that he get out of that Embassy. The United States has never filed any formal charges against Assange."</p> <p>Trump has the ability to grant a preemptive pardon, which means that he would never have to face trial or be extradited here at all." -Cassandra Fairbanks</p> </q> <p>Fairbanks then points out that the media thrives on leaked information, which is often false, and sometimes results in "disastrous consequences, sometimes even deadly - like the case in the Iraq War," adding "unlike the fake news published by outlets like the NYT to sell war to the public, Assange has published true, real information that has influenced the public to want to get out of wars."</p> <p>She then notes that Assange was "once held in the absolute highest regard by the left for the publishing of the Iraq and Afghan war logs," crippling the agenda of the "war-hungry swamp" and dealing a massive blow to the Bush administration.</p> <q> <p>We elected Trump because of his rejection of the war-monger establishment, and the fake news media. With what he represents, Trump should be giving Assange a medal and throwing him a parade instead of allowing his political persecution to continue.

Some of the nearly 100 migrants from Central America and Mexico have been allowed to enter the U.S. as they seek asylum, but the road for them is far from over. (CNN) <p>TIJUANA, Mexico — U.S. border inspectors allowed some of the Central American asylum seekers to enter the country for processing, ending a brief impasse over lack of space. Now, the migrants who crossed Mexico in a caravan may face a long legal path.</p> Nearly 100 migrants from Central America, Mexico seek asylum Some are trying to get out of native countries filled with gang violence Vice President Mike Pence says caravan is trying to "undermine" U.S. laws <p>Some of the nearly 100 migrants from Central America and Mexico have been allowed to enter the U.S. as they seek asylum, but the road for them is far from over.</p> <p>Men, women and children of all ages are part of this caravan that has been moving from Honduras, into El Salvador, and then Mexico.</p> <p>Over the weekend, they reached the U.S. border and many are currently being blocked from entering the states.</p> <p>They have arrived in Tijuana, the famous Mexican city that borders southern California, just outside of San Diego.</p> <p>Border patrol agents in San Diego have let a handful of people through to process them, where they will then be held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p> <p>Vice President Mike Pence spoke in front of border patrol and pledged to build the wall.</p> <p>"This situation is a direct result of our weak immigration laws and our porous border. This caravan, like those who have gone before, is also rightly understood as a deliberate attempt to undermine the laws of this country and the sovereignty of the United States," said Pence.</p> <p>While the roughly 100 migrants at the border say they need to be let in now before it is too late for them.</p> <p>A grandmother of two, Isabel Rodriguez, says she is fleeing El Salvador because of the growing gang violence and wants to be given asylum in the U.S.</p> <p>"Mr. Trump, just like you allowed our fellow brothers and sisters from Central America to live in the country, allow us the opportunity. We want to work, we don't want handouts. We want a better future for our family," pleaded Rodriguez.</p> <p>American attorneys who volunteered advice in Tijuana last week warned the Central Americans that parents may be separated from their children and be detained for many months while their asylum cases are pending.</p> <p>Asylum-seekers are typically held up to three days at the border and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer’s initial screening, they may be detained or released with ankle monitors while their cases wind through immigration court, which can take years.</p> <p>Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, but few are likely to win asylum.</p> <p>The denial rate for El Salvadorans seeking asylum was 79 percent from 2012 to 2017, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Action Clearinghouse. Hondurans were close behind with a 78 percent denial rate, followed Guatemalans at 75 percent.</p> <p>Trump administration officials have railed against what they call "legal loopholes" and "catch-and-release” policies that allow people seeking asylum to be freed while their cases are adjudicated. The president tweeted Monday that the caravan "shows how weak &amp;amp; ineffective U.S. immigration laws are."</p> <p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions has pledged to send more immigration judges to the border if needed and threatened criminal prosecution. On Monday, the Justice Department said it filed illegal entry charges against 11 people identified as caravan members.</p> <p>The Associated Press contributed to this story.</p></article>

	<article id="0001108" published-at="2018-04-05" title="Could the Baltimore County executive race come down to NRA support?"><p>A bump stock is an alteration that allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire like an automatic weapon (Los Angeles Times video)</p> <p>Polls <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/10/12/guns-in-america-facts-figures/" type="external">indicate</a> that a majority of Americans favor a host of gun control restrictions, including safe storage laws, the right to sue negligent dealers and barring domestic abusers from having guns. The <a type="internal">NRA</a> has successfully blocked such measures — and in fact, pushed the nation in the opposite direction, loosening gun laws over the last decade. Why is this?</p> <p>The answer, unfortunately, is that voters who support stronger gun control neglect to hold lawmakers accountable for kowtowing to the NRA. That may well change, with the youth leading the way after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting this year, laying bare the cowardice of lawmakers and pressing the need for basic gun control measures. In this year’s elections across the nation, voters have the opportunity to set things straight by electing lawmakers who will stand up to the NRA and enact sensible gun laws.</p> <p>It turns out Baltimore County voters will have this choice. Democratic State Sen. Jim Brochin, who is running for Baltimore County Executive, has repeatedly stood up to the NRA and backed sensible gun laws. Meanwhile his opponent in the Democratic primary, Johnny Olszewski Jr. — who has earned the backing of the Baltimore County Progressive Democrats Club — has repeatedly done the NRA’s bidding.</p> <p>Both legislators once drew praise from the NRA, but that changed with the <a type="internal">Sandy Hook shooting</a> in December 2012. Senator Brochin cut ties with the increasingly reckless gun lobby, and <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?pid=flrvotepage&amp;tab=subject3&amp;id=SB0281%2cs-1025&amp;stab=02&amp;ys=2013rs" type="external">supported</a> Maryland’s landmark Firearms Safety Act, which strengthened gun restrictions — banning the sale of assault weapons in the state, limiting the size of gun magazines and requiring handgun purchasers to undergo licensing and safety training.</p> <p>In so doing, Senator Brochin appears to have followed his conscience and done what he felt was the right thing, enacting sensible and moderate gun safety rules. He surely knew this was a political risk, as he had just been redistricted into a more conservative district, including Northern Baltimore County all the way to the Pennsylvania state line — all of whose local and state representatives were already Republican, except for Senator Brochin. He displayed courage in standing up to the NRA in support of this landmark legislation.</p> <p>Shockingly, Mr. Olszewski submitted to the NRA and as a member of the <a type="internal">Maryland House of Delegates</a> <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?pid=flrvotepage&amp;tab=subject3&amp;id=SB0281,h-0895&amp;stab=02&amp;ys=2013rs" type="external">voted against</a> the 2013 Firearms Safety Act. This while he served a district that was represented at the time entirely by a Democratic delegation. For his loyalty to the gun lobby, Mr. Olszewski <a href="http://marylandreporter.com/2014/06/11/20-battle-for-open-legislative-seats-in-dundalk/" type="external">received</a> an A rating from the NRA and <a href="https://votesmart.org/interest-group/1496/national-rifle-association-political-victory-fund#.WrRr3WaZPq0" type="external">was</a> a 2014 beneficiary of the NRA victory fund. If he hoped this might earn him support from conservative voters, he was wrong; Mr. Olszewski lost his bid for state senator in the 2014 elections.</p> <p>These politicians have a history of casting dissimilar votes on common sense gun legislation. In 2009, Senator Brochin <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?ys=2009rs%2fvotes%2fsenate%2f0796.htm" type="external">supported</a> a measure to confiscate guns from domestic violence suspects who had received a temporary protective order against them. This is an effective policy for making domestic violence incidents less deadly. As Everytown for Gun Safety <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/guns-domestic-violence/" type="external">points out</a>, “The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times more likely that a woman will be killed.” Mr. Olszewski <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?ys=2009rs/votes/house/0303.htm" type="external">voted against</a> taking guns away from people with a temporary protective order against them.</p> <p>Though Senator Brochin represents a markedly more conservative district, he has continued to be re-elected — and continues to vote his conscience on guns. Senator Brochin is a <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2018RS/bills/sb/sb0707T.pdf" type="external">co-sponsor</a> of the bill to ban bump stocks, which can transform semiautomatic rifles into fully automatic rifles. This mechanism was used by the Las Vegas shooter, who killed 56 people and injured 300 last October. This bill passed in the legislature Wednesday.</p> <p>Senator Brochin has also <a href="https://wtop.com/maryland/2018/02/md-lawmakers-want-eliminate-handgun-permit-review-board/" type="external">endorsed</a> legislation to dissolve the Maryland State Handgun Permit Review Board, where Gov. Larry Hogan has appointed NRA sympathizers who appear to green light applicants over the concerns of law enforcement. Siding with the gun safety group Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence, Senator Brochin favors giving permit decisions to administrative law judges, who will do so objectively and independently, with public safety foremost in mind.</p> <p>As the mass shootings mount — Orlando is followed by Las Vegas, followed by Sutherland Springs, Texas; followed by Parkland, Fla. — the American public is waking up to the gun laws in their midst. They realize that their lawmakers have been selling out to the NRA and enacting reckless gun laws. Senator Jim Brochin is a notable exception to this depressing trend; voters who care about reducing gun violence must support him in the upcoming election for Baltimore County Executive.</p> <p>Firmin DeBrabander ( <a href="mailto:fdebrabander@mica.edu" type="external">fdebrabander@mica.edu</a>) is a professor of philosophy at the Maryland Institute College of Art, and author of “Do Guns Make Us Free?

	<article id="0001109" published-at="2017-08-28" title="Black-clad anarchists storm Berkeley rally, assaulting 5"><p>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Black-clad anarchists on Sunday stormed into what had been a largely peaceful Berkeley protest against hate and attacked at least five people, including the leader of a politically conservative group who canceled an event a day earlier in San Francisco amid fears of violence.</p> <p>The group of more than 100 hooded protesters, with shields emblazoned with the words “no hate” and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchists, busted through police lines, avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons. Then the anarchists blended with a crowd of 2,000 largely peaceful protesters who turned up to demonstrate in a “Rally Against Hate” opposed to a much smaller gathering of right-wing protesters.</p> <p>Berkeley police chief Andrew Greenwood defended how police handled the protest, saying they made a strategic decision to let the anarchists enter to avoid more violence.</p> <p>Greenwood said “the potential use of force became very problematic” given the thousands of peaceful protesters in the park. Once anarchists arrived, it was clear there would not be dueling protests between left and right so he ordered his officers out of the park and allowed the anarchists to march in.</p> <p>There was “no need for a confrontation over a grass patch,” Greenwood said.</p> Hundreds of people are marching around San Francisco’s Alamo Square park holding signs condemning white supremacists and chanting, “Whose streets? Our streets!” (Aug. 26) <p>Among those assaulted was Joey Gibson, the leader of the Patriot Prayer group, which canceled a Saturday rally and was then prevented from holding a news conference when authorities closed off the public square Gibson planned to use. Gibson has denounced racism and said he launched Patriot Prayer after several supporters of President Donald Trump were beaten at a Trump campaign stop in San Jose, California, last year. Authorities nonetheless feared the group’s event could attract white nationalists, as it has in the past.</p> <p>After the anarchists spotted Gibson at the Berkeley park, they pepper-sprayed him and chased him out as he backed away with his hands held in the air. Gibson rushed behind a line of police wearing riot gear, who set off a smoke bomb to drive away the anarchists.</p> <p>Separately, groups of hooded, black-clad protesters attacked at least four other men in or near the park, kicking and punching them until the assaults were stopped by police. The assaults were witnessed by an Associated Press reporter.</p> <p>Police in the San Francisco area have been braced for violence and trying to prevent protests that draw left-wing and right-wing opponents since the deadly confrontation in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 that occurred during a rally of white supremacists.</p> <p>Berkeley authorities did not issue a permit for Sunday’s gathering of right-wing protesters. Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin had urged counterprotesters to stay away from Civic Center Park.</p> <p>The right-wing event had been canceled by organizer Amber Cummings, who encouraged supporters to stay away but said she would attend on her own.</p> <p>By mid-afternoon Cummings had not appeared and left-wing protesters far outnumbered right-wing supporters.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, police had set up barricades around park and checked people who entered to make sure they did not have prohibited items like baseball bats, dogs, skateboards and scarves or bandanas they could use to cover their faces.</p> <p>Officers arrested 13 people, most for having prohibited items, Greenwood said.</p> <p>At one point, an anti-rally protester denounced a Latino man holding a “God Bless Donald Trump” sign.</p> <p>“You are an immigrant,” Karla Fonseca said. “You should be ashamed of yourself.”</p> <p>Several other people also yelled at the man, who said he was born in Mexico but supports Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the southern border.</p> <p>Police pulled one supporter of President Donald Trump out of the park over a wall by his shirt as a crowd of about two dozen counter-demonstrators surrounded him and chanted “Nazi go home” and pushed him toward the edge of the park. At least two people were detained by officers for wearing bandannas covering their faces.</p> <p>Anti-rally protesters chanted slogans “No Trump. No KKK. No fascist USA” and carried signs that said: “Berkeley Stands United Against Hate.”</p> <p>A separate group of counterprotesters had assembled earlier Sunday at the nearby University of California, Berkeley campus and then marched park to merge with the anti-rally protesters who had already gathered there.</p> <p>Both Cummings and Gibson have disavowed racism and say they wanted to hold the rallies to bring conservative voices to the liberal San Francisco Bay Area.</p> <p>Student activism was born during the 1960s free-speech movement at Berkeley, when thousands of students at the university mobilized to demand that the school drop its ban on political activism.</p> <p>However, the violence in Charlottesville led San Francisco area police and civil leaders to rethink their response to protests.</p> <p>___</p> <p>Associated Press writers Terry Chea and Marcio Sanchez in Berkeley contributed to this report.</p></article>

HTML5 is not supported!</p> <p>The Islamic State's English-language media wing on Saturday released an article about the U.S. presidential election, three days before Americans take to the polls. The seven-page PDF warns American Muslims to not participate in voting for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump and quotes verses from the Quran to demonstrate why democracy is antithetical to Islam.</p> <p>ISIS's al-Hayat Media Center released the article, called <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/isis-islamic-state-al-hayat-media-the-murtad-vote-pdf-download-read-2016-presidential-election-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-apostasy/" type="external">"The Murtadd Vote,"</a> ("The Apostate Vote") on social media platforms such as Twitter and Telegram. It is a screed against American politics and democracy, which it refers to as "paganism." One of the main arguments it puts forward is that American Muslims who participate in elections are apostates because they have directly contributed to other Muslims being killed in America's numerous wars. "And after almost thirty years of history proving to the entire world that there is no difference between the American Republican and Democratic parties in their policies against Islam and Muslims, the murtadd imams of the so-called 'Muslim Brotherhood' and its sister sects continue to advocate voting in the pagan festivals of U.S. democracy," the article reads.</p> <p>Additionally, the piece says that any manmade laws and democratic institutions amount to idolatry (in Arabic, taghut, or its plural, tawaghit) and should therefore be shunned by Muslims. "Accordingly, human legislators, manmade laws, modern constitutions, judges who rule thereby, and rulers who enforce such upon others are all tawaghit whom the Muslim must disassociate from and disbelieve in," it reads. The article also uses this same argument as a justification for violence: "Hence, as it is clear that the voter is a part of the taghut of democracy — 'the power of the people' — and that the voters are directly involved in the decision making process by choosing delegates to represent them and their whims executively, judicially, and legislatively, the blood of Crusader voters is even more deserving of being spilled than the blood of Crusader combatants."</p> <p>"The Murtadd Vote" ends on a grim note, hoping that November 8 ends in horror for the American public. "May Allah make this year's U.S. presidential election a dreadful calamity like no other to have struck America throughout its pathetic history," it reads.</p> <p>The post <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/news/373743/isis-releases-article-on-u-s-election/" type="external">ISIS Releases Article On U.S. Election</a> appeared first on <a href="http://www.vocativ.com" type="external">Vocativ</a>.</p></article>

(And, boy, did that work! We haven’t heard a peep about “crops rotting in the fields” since then.)</p> <p>The agricultural amnesty was supposed to apply to — at most — 350,000 illegal aliens. It would be available only to illegals who were currently in the country doing the back-breaking farm work that no American would do. Without them, crops would wither on the vine. They were saving us from starvation!</p> <p>Talk about deserving. Are any Dreamers saving us from starvation?</p> <p>But instead of guest-worker permits, then-Rep. Charles Schumer — from the lush farmland of Brooklyn — decided to grant full amnesty to any illegals who had done farm work for at least 90 days in the previous year.</p> <p>That’s pretty restrictive, isn’t it?</p> <p>In the end, “up to 350,000 farm workers” turned into 1.3 million.</p> <p>Oh well, what are you going to do? No use worrying — let’s just move forward and get all these people voter registration cards!</p> <p>This innocent little amnesty for a small, clearly defined group of illegals quickly became amnesty for anyone who applied. The same thing will happen with any other amnesty, no matter how strictly the law is written. (And it won’t be written strictly.)</p> <p>In the first few years of the agricultural amnesty, internal Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics showed that 888,637 legalization applications were fraudulent. According to immigration agents, “farm workers” stated in their interviews that cotton was purple or that they had pulled cherries from the ground.</p> <p>Of the 888,637 fraudulent applications, guess how many our government approved. Answer: More than 800,000.</p> <p>The agricultural amnesty was so carefully administered that not one, but TWO of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers were in this country because of it. (More on that in another column.)</p> <p>The main problem with the farm worker amnesty, the DACA amnesty or any amnesty is that everyone involved in the entire immigration apparatus is feverishly working, on the taxpayer’s dime, to transform this country into a Third World hellhole. Lawyers for La Raza and lawyers for the government both believe it is their mission to humiliate and destroy white Christian America. (Actually, this country is “biracial Christian America,” plus a few Amerindians and anyone else who assimilated to Western European culture.)</p> <p>There are multitudes of them, and they will never, ever stop.</p> <p>Congress could pass a law granting amnesty to any 7-foot-tall, left-handed, red-headed illegal aliens from Lichtenstein — and hundreds of left-wing outfits would instantly set to work, demanding amnesty for witch doctors, cannibals, pederasts, terrorists and the rest of the multicultural universe that makes America so vibrant.</p> <p>On the other side of the application process would be government immigration bureaucrats who either used to work at La Raza, or hope to in the future.</p> <p>On the off chance that some particularly risible amnesty application is denied by a stodgy rules-follower in our immigration bureaucracy, that denial will be litigated before a federal judge in Hawaii, then appealed to the Ninth Circuit.</p> <p>For two decades after the 1986 amnesty, the federal courts were tied up with dozens of class-action lawsuits brought on behalf of illegal aliens — regular illegal aliens, farm worker illegal aliens and still-in-Mexico illegal aliens — challenging every aspect of the law.</p> <p>Is that how American tax dollars should be spent? On endless litigation, brought by America-hating activists on behalf of people who have no right to be in our country and decided by Democrat-appointed judges? (Who are also America-hating activists.)</p> <p>And when their work is done, there will be a lot more Democrat-appointed judges because there will be a lot more Democrats.</p> <p>Lawyers sued over everything — the absence of Creole interpreters, the requirement that illegals have proof of prior farm work and the rare denials of amnesty. Congress desperately tried passing laws that would prevent courts from hearing these cases — all to no avail. Left-wing lawyers just had to pick the right judge, and they won.</p> <p>In 2005 — nearly 20 years after the 1986 amnesty — the Ninth Circuit was still granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who claimed they had been unfairly denied because they were not in the country for the first amnesty. Seriously.</p> <p>No matter how the law is written, as long as anyone is eligible for amnesty, everybody’s getting amnesty.</p> <p>President Trump is the last president who will ever have a chance to make the right decision on immigration. After this, it’s over. The boat will have sailed.</p> <p>If he succeeds, all the p@ssy-grabbing and Russia nonsense will burn off like a morning fog. He will be the president who saved the American nation, its character, its sovereignty, its core identity. But if he fails, Donald Trump will go down in history as the man who killed America.</p></article>

Watch The Video: <p>Triathlete Cayley Mackay and her girlfriend Nicole Erato were in the middle of the Ironman 70.3 World Championships when they learned that their entire country, the island of Saint Maarten/Saint Martin, was destroyed by the eye of Category 5+ Hurricane Irma. Cayley shared her experience with us and different ways in which we can help.</p> Play VideoPlayLoaded: 0%Progress: 0%Remaining Time -0:00 <p>This is a modal window.</p> Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done <p>AfterEllen: Where is your home located and what category level was Hurricane Irma when it hit your house?</p> <p>Cayley Mackay: My home is located on the beautiful Caribbean island of Sint Maarten. Hurricane Irma was a level 5+ as they were experiencing winds and conditions much worse than a typical Category 5. It was largest hurricane in history in the Atlantic and according to the New York Times “has broken records for accumulated cyclone energy, a measure that combines storm strength and duration”. The eye hit Sint Maarten and was so large that satellite imagery shower the entire island in the eye of Irma.</p> AfterEllen: What did you return to when you got back? <p>Cayley Mackay: There is no power. No water. No hospital. No airport. No nothing. My girlfriend Nicole and I were away representing Sint Maarten at the Ironman 70.3 World Championships when the hurricane hit. We did not hear from our family for over 48 hours. We are not able to return to the island yet as there are no flights, at this point it is only evacuation flights allowed to enter and that is recent.</p> Sint Maarten Before Hurricane Irma Sint Maarten After Hurricane Irma <p>AfterEllen: How many others are going through this on your Island?</p> <p>Cayley Mackay: The island is 37.2 square miles and is divided between Dutch (Sint Maarten) and French (Saint Martin). The population of the entire island is around 100,000 people and every single person has been affected. Most of our friends and family have lost their homes, lost their businesses, lost everything. If you still have a roof over your head (literally because thousands of roofs were ripped off) you are considered to be very lucky right now. There are dozens of deaths and we still have friends who are unaccounted for.</p> AfterEllen: What are you and others doing to cope with the devastation? <p>Cayley Mackay: Nicole and I are doing everything in our power to get the word out that SXM needs international aid. We have been fundraising for the island ( <a href="http://www.rebuildsxm.com/" type="external">www.rebuildsxm.com</a>) and also four ourselves as we have also suffered extensive damage ( <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/nicoleandcayley" type="external">www.gofundme.com/nicoleandcayley</a>). We have also been helping to evacuate as many people and animals as possible. Yesterday we were able to arrange for the evacuation of Nicole’s very ill grandmother to a hospital in Aruba as well as her grandfather and goddaughter.</p> <p>Those at home have been trying to survive. People have been running out of water and food. Saturday, Sept. 9, they were under hurricane warning from Hurricane Jose so people were trying to find safe places to stay that had not already been destroyed by Irma. It is definitely survival mode. But the people of Sint Maarten/Saint Martin are resilient. They are helping each other in as many ways as possible, sharing food and water and providing shelter when they can. Of course there are also those who are taking advantage of the situation and there has been wide spread looting and crime however most are doing their best to help. The spirit I have seen from home is unmatched.</p> AfterEllen: How can those reading this article help? <p>Cayley Mackay: The biggest thing right now is to spread the word. Irma has destroyed so many. Most recently it has affected Florida and most of the big news stations are turning away from showing the damage and destruction on the islands to show Florida. Please don’t forget about us! We are an isolated island and will not be able to rebuild on our own. We need the world to know how much help we need so the first thing people can do is help us to spread the word. The second thing is to donate. Money donations can be sent to <a href="http://www.rebuildsxm.com/" type="external">www.rebuildsxm.com</a> and care packages are being put together throughout the world to send. Nicole and I are only one of tens of thousands who have been affected and we still do not know the full report of damage but we do know that it is extensive. If you are interested in donating to us personally you can do so at <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/nicoleandcayley" type="external">www.gofundme.com/nicoleandcayley</a>.</p> AfterEllen: Is there anything else you would like us to know? <p>Cayley Mackay: The world lost contact with Sint Maarten around 6:30am on Wednesday September 6th when the eye hit. The last thing we heard was Nicole’s mom screaming at her dad to get back because he was trying to hold the doors shut and her grandmother crying and screaming that the roof was coming off. Her uncles roof has already come off. We then waited over 48 hours in a numb state waiting to hear if they had survived. Our story is normal. The destruction is unimaginable. Lives have been changed forever. We need help. The island needs help. Please don’t forget about us.</p> AfterEllen will be holding a fundraiser to help raise money for disaster relief organizations next week during our 15-Year Anniversary Celebration.

Photo Credit: Curt Johnson/Flickr <p>If you’re following the Daily Stormer drama, you know that the alt-right neo-Nazi site is in hot water. After Heather Heyer was killed in a domestic terrorist attack following the white supremacist rally and ensuing riot in Charlottesville over the weekend, the Daily Stormer published a venomous article denouncing Heyer as a “Fat, Childless 32-Year-Old Slut.” GoDaddy has revoked the website’s <a href="https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/daily-caller-booted-google-godaddy-charlottesville-victim" type="external">domain name</a>, and Google is punishing it too. That’s all well and good, but you may have missed Facebook’s huge role in helping the piece going viral.</p> <p>Over the weekend, the article was a top result in Facebook searches under the “News” category, earning a massive share count. One reader reported on Twitter that the piece had been shared on Facebook 90K times as of Monday night.</p> <q> <p>also if ur wondering how garbage like daily stormer is disseminated, that story has 65 THOUSAND shares on <a href="https://twitter.com/facebook" type="external">@facebook</a> &amp;amp; is listed under news. <a href="https://t.co/KykJOjPbq8" type="external">pic.twitter.com/KykJOjPbq8</a></p>— susie banikarim (@banikarim) <a href="https://twitter.com/banikarim/status/896877077575630852" type="external">August 13, 2017</a> </q> <p>The Daily Stormer is a self-proclaimed white supremacist site that routinely <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/neo-nazi-gave-out-internet-abuse-tips-in-campaign-against-luciana-berger-1.60174" type="external">targets</a> African Americans, Jews, and Arabs, promotes the use of the hashtag #HitlerWasRight and endorses the use of eugenics, among countless other offenses. It's vile, even beyond the likes of Breitbart and the Daily Caller.</p> <p>It’s not news that Facebook’s algorithm has a huge impact on the Daily Stormer’s (and all other publishers’) readership. In 2016, Gizmodo reported that Facebook News curators admitted to suppressing <a href="https://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006?rev=1462799465508" type="external">right-wing stories</a>, greatly impacting traffic to those sites. The social media platform came under fire again for boosting fake news stories during the 2016 election, and since then, has been on a crusade against fake news with the help of fact-checking organizations like Poynter and Snopes. To reverse the damage it helped cause, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16147126/facebook-delete-viral-post-charlottesville-daily-stormer" type="external">Facebook is now deleting links</a> to the Daily Stormer article about Heather Heyer. But it's far too little, too late.</p> <p>There will always be evil, offensive people like the writers and editors at the Daily Stormer who will spin a tragedy like Charlottesville into cash. But the real danger lies in media monoliths like Facebook promoting their work. Certainly, the site has done a much better job than Twitter derailing hate speech on the internet. But many thousands of readers only found that Daily Stormer piece because Facebook automatically and unwittingly characterized it as “news.”</p> <p>In digital media, where pageviews from even the most odious sources mean advertising revenue, the Daily Stormer will probably be laughing all the way to the bank.

President Donald Trump speak to members of the media regarding the on going situation in Charlottesville, Va., Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017 at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminister, N.J. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) <p>President Donald Trump blamed "many sides" for <a type="internal">violence in Charlottesville, Virginia</a>, in the wake of a white nationalist demonstration.</p> <p><a type="internal">His comments</a> drew swift reactions. Democrats and some Republicans called on him to specifically denounce white supremacy and racially motivated hate by name. Vice President Mike Pence supported the president's speech. A white supremacist website praised the comments.</p> <p>What Trump said:</p> <p>"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides," Trump said. "It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump. Not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time."</p> <p>What others are saying:</p> <p>— "I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president." — Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer, a Democrat.</p> <p>— "Mr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism." — Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., on Twitter.</p> <p>— "Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists" — Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Twitter.</p> <p>— "@POTUS needs to speak out against the poisonous resurgence of white supremacy. There are not "many sides" here, just right and wrong." - Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on Twitter.</p> <p>— "As @POTUS Trump said, "We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation... &amp;amp; true affection for each other." #Charlottesville" — Vice President Mike Pence on Twitter.</p> <p>— "Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy." — Former President Bill Clinton on Twitter.</p> <p>— "The violence, chaos, and apparent loss of life in Charlottesville is not the fault of "many sides." It is racists and white supremacists." — Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat.</p> <p>— "We reject the racism and violence of white nationalists like the ones acting out in Charlottesville. Everyone in leadership must speak out." — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and Trump supporter.</p> <p>— "We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home. -OGH" — Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on Twitter.</p> <p>— "Trump comments were good. He didn't attack us. He just said the nation should come together. Nothing specific against us. ... No condemnation at all. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good.

The actor, who worked with Weinstein on Good Will Hunting, released a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/benaffleck/posts/1675252255882528" type="external">statement</a> on Facebook saying he was "saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women." He wrote that "we must support those who come forward" and "condemn this type of behavior when we see it."</p> <p>Rose McGowan wasn't buying it, though, and now, former TRL host Hilarie Burton has come forward to remind everyone that Affleck himself groped her on the show back in 2003.</p> <p>According to Rose McGowan, Affleck was fully aware of Weinstein's behavior and even "told him to stop doing that."</p> <q> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenAffleck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">@benaffleck</a> “GODDAMNIT!

	<article id="0001124" published-at="2017-10-17" title="A Brief History Of The Verbal War Between John McCain And Donald Trump">
Getty Image <p>President <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> is not noted for being taciturn, and Arizona Senator <a type="internal">John McCain</a> doesn’t suffer fools. So, that the two would butt heads would seem all but inevitable, but McCain’s Liberty Medal speech is just the latest shot in a lengthy war. Let’s run down a brief history of the barbs these two have exchanged, which all began around the time that Trump announced his presidential candidacy.</p> July 18, 2015: Trump fires the first shot by <a type="internal">saying that he</a> “likes people who weren’t captured,” which was a reference to McCain’s years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. Trump refuses to apologize despite <a type="internal">enormous criticism</a> from GOP leadership, including from McCain’s good friend, Senator <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/622455743917215744" type="external">Lindsay Graham</a>. July 21, 2015: Trump delivers an apology on Bill O’Reilly’s show <a type="internal">that many viewed</a> as insincere. September 9, 2015: Trump’s remarks are revived again when it comes out he believed <a type="internal">going to prep school was better</a> than actual military service in terms of service to one’s country. August 1, 2016: McCain <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/01/politics/john-mccain-statement-khan-family/index.html" type="external">distances</a> both himself and the GOP from Trump’s attacks on the service of Humayun S. M. Khan and his parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan: <q> <p>“In recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier’s parents. He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States — to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump’s statement. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.”</p> </q> August 2, 2016: Trump <a type="internal">refuses to endorse</a> McCain for reelection. The refusal <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-arizona-senate-mccain-vs-kirkpatrick" type="external">has no impact</a> whatsoever on McCain’s poll numbers. October 8, 2016: McCain <a type="internal">withdraws his endorsement</a> of Trump over the Access Hollywood hot mic scandal. October 11, 2016: Trump <a type="internal">complains</a> that McCain won’t vote for him and refers to him as “foul-mouthed.” November 21, 2016: In response to Trump’s remarks about “enhanced interrogation,” McCain bluntly informs Trump that <a type="internal">the U.S. is not allowed</a> to torture people. January 11, 2017: It’s revealed that John McCain <a type="internal">informed the FBI</a> of the notorious Steele dossier, which included, among other claims, that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in which Obama once slept. February 2, 2017: After a bizarrely contentious call with the Prime Minister of Australia, John McCain expresses America’s <a type="internal">unwavering support for the nation</a>. Later in the year, it will be revealed McCain has been <a type="internal">quietly working</a> in foreign policy, smoothing over Trump’s missteps.</article>

Flying the American flag upside down is widely recognized as the “official” signal for distress.</p> <p>The sight quickly sparked conversation on Twitter with several people asking if this was secretly a distress call from Spicer.</p> <p>While others asked if he was wearing an upside down American flag pin in support of, or promoting the hit Netflix series House of Cards.</p> <p>Once Spicer turned the briefing over to reporters, they quickly addressed the pin.</p> <p>He opened the floor to Fox News' John Roberts, who said, “Your pin is upside down.” Spicer responded, “John Roberts always helping me with the fashion tips.”</p> <p>Spicer moved the pin, but that wasn’t enough. He was told again it was upside down and then asked if it was distress call.</p> <p>He jokingly laughed with the reporters and told them it wasn’t a distress call.

The masked, ant-like, skinny jeaned, Taliban bearded violent arm of the Democratic Party would have found a home in Hitler’s Germany, Stalin’s Soviet Union, Honecker’s East Germany and Pol Pot’s Cambodia.</p> <p>The Antifa are funded by George Soros and have several goals: to destroy property, to attack conservatives or anyone deemed an enemy of the left, to serve as modern day SA Brownshirts in the left’s destruction of every single American institution, American value and tenet of American civilization.</p> <p>The Antifa are in existence to establish a beachhead, where the forces of liberalism and globalism not only land, but move inland to complete the takedown of America by the left and the global elite.</p> <p>The Antifa are simply the enemy of the America way of life and any American who believes in freedom and the Bill of Rights.</p> <p>In the name of diversity, the Antifa preaches violence and the end to free speech.</p> <p>In the name of tolerance, the Antifa burns down buildings, sets cars on fire and assaults innocent people.</p> <p>In the name of peace and harmony, the Antifa seeks to eradicate every statue, flag and monument of Americans they deem to be their enemy.</p> <p>The Antifa vandalized businesses and destroyed personal property during President Trump’s inauguration. In protest to the coming visit of right wing speaker and blogger, Milo Yiannopoulos, the Antifa went on a burning, pillaging and plundering rampage, like 21st Century Visigoths across the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, as the local police looked on and did nothing.</p> <p>During a <a href="https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/05/04/what-is-antifa-controversial-far-left-group-defends-use-of-violence/22067671/" type="external">May Day</a>in Portland, Oregon, violence erupted resulting in 25 arrests after Antifa protesters allegedly attacked police officers, emergency workers and destroyed property resulting in the city pulling the parade permit.</p> <p>The Antifa website, It’s Going Down, <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/" type="external">https://itsgoingdown.org/</a> preaches violence and encourages its supporters to attack conservatives and anyone considered a fascist.</p> <p>And, now the Antifa, are vowing to wreak havoc at Gettysburg National Park tomorrow and this weekend, on the 154th anniversary of the most famous and decisive battle of the Civil War.

Eventually, if you seek to do harm to property and innocent citizens, the law of physics will boomerang back to you in the shape of a fist, a club, a knife, a bottle or a gun.</p> <p>The left’s blood lust and violence is going to end one way and one way only, when the right counter-punches. Have no doubt, it’s coming and when the right finally reacts the response will come like a mighty thunderclap in the night.</p> <p>The Antifa are left wing scum and nothing more.</p></article>
	<article id="0001128" published-at="2016-11-04" title="Lil Wayne's 'Nightline' Fail Shows Why Asking Celebrities For More Than What They Sell Leads To Disappointment">
Thaddaeus McAdams/FilmMagic <p>Who is <a type="internal">Lil Wayne</a> to most? It’s an important question to ask when even trying to put his words and actions in context. He’s a marvelous, prolific rap artist known for witty, spastic wordplay—often dipping from lines about feeling like an alien-like outcast to outlandish quips about sexual exploits. "So misunderstood, but what’s a world without enigma?” he wonders on his 2010 classic “6 Foot 7 Foot.” That’s immediately followed by “Two bitches at the same time, [like] synchronized swimmers.” Raps like that and many more about grinding to achieve goals, then celebrating those wins have made the Grammy-winning rhymer one of the best ever in his genre.</p> <p>On Wednesday (Nov. 2), Lil Wayne (real name Dwyane Carter) landed in hot water after ABC News' Nightline aired an interview with the rapper. Attached to promotion of his Gone Till November book, a jail memoir about his months spent in New York’s Rikers Island on gun possession charges, the interview took a turn when reporter Linsey Davis asked him about his, at times, misogynistic lyrics: "Would you have a problem with [your daughter] being called a b-tch or a ho?"</p> <p>Already causing a stir with his controversial September interview with <a type="internal">FS1’s sports talk show Skip and Shannon:</a> <a type="internal">Undisputed</a> where Wayne claimed "that there was no such thing as racism no more" -- given the white audiences his concerts attract -- Davis then asked him about his thoughts on the Black Lives Matter movement. Wayne, to her apparent surprise, asked that she explain it to him. Then, perhaps feeling attacked, he became defensive.</p> <p>"I am a young Black rich motherf--ker," Wayne began. “If that doesn’t let you know that America understands Black n---as matter these days, I don’t know what it is. Don’t come at me with that dumb shit, ma’am. My life matters, especially to my b-tches. I don't feel connected to a damn thing that ain't got nothin' to do with me. If you do, you're crazy as shit.” He proceeded to tell Davis what he is connected to by whipping out a red bandana from his back pocket, seemingly to show his affiliation to the Bloods, a Los Angeles gang with branches all over the country. Interview over.</p> <p>First, let’s address the massive levels of isolation and ignorance it takes to not know what “Black Lives Matter” is about in 2016. It’s beyond difficult to believe that an artist who’s as connected to the outside world as Lil Wayne doesn't know what’s going on in it. By virtue of being a massive sports fan alone, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s stance against the National Anthem is an unavoidable entry point to the issues of Black America for Wayne.</p> <p>Aside from his alleged Bloods affiliation, Wayne’s connected to something that hits closer to home: his family. In the aforementioned Undisputed interview, Wayne thoughtfully explained that his children are his only true concern. “My politics, my flag, my country, my nation, my world are [my children] Reginae, Cameron, Neal and his brother [Dwayne]. That’s all that matters." Fair enough. But there is an obvious connection to be made with a 34-year-old Black father raising three Black sons and one Black daughter, and wanting them (and the world they grow up in) to be safe from potentially racist, gun-happy cops. Yes, fame can, and often does, gift those with it a freedom from traditional prejudices but it’s hard to accept that Wayne’s that far gone. Certainly not when he has songs in his catalog that speak directly to social injustice and racism.</p> <p>Months removed from 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, which annihilated Wayne’s native New Orleans, the rapper released what arguably is his most politically heated song to date "Georgia… Bush." It’s a cut that attacks then President George Bush, the U.S. government for their negligence in dispersing FEMA aid to the mostly African American refugees in Louisiana, and the media reporting on it. "Boy them cops is killas in my home," he spits on the ’06 track. "N---a shot dead in the middle of the street/I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat/Man, f--k the police and President (Georgia) Bush.”</p> <p>Just this year, Wayne was a featured guest on <a type="internal">Solange Knowles</a> critically acclaimed A Seat At The Table -- arguably the Blackest album of 2016 in terms of addressing social issues of today from track one to completion -- for the song " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjwHMuLdytY" type="external">Mad</a>." Here, Solange sings to fellow Blacks about how it’s okay to be frustrated about how the system treats African Americans. Wayne jumps in to let loose about feeling stressed, including a few bars on what it’s like to be an affluent man that looks like he does when visiting his financial institution.</p> <p>"Then I walk up in the bank, pants sagging down,” he raps. "And I laugh at frowns, what they mad about? 'Cause here come this motherfucker with this mass account that didn't wear cap and gown/Are you mad 'cause the judge ain't give me more time?" As far as imagery goes it’s not a stretch to assume that at least some of those with prejudices against him -- a young Black man -- are white people in that scenario. Lil Wayne knows what racism is -- and it’s evident he’s aware of it in 2016. So why not speak about it?</p> <p>As Wayne ripped the Nightline microphone pack from his chest and strolled off, he’s heard saying, "I ain’t no f--king politician." That is true -- Lil Wayne is Lil Wayne and that’s not what he’s known for selling.</p> <p>There lies the plight faced by anyone hoping for Wayne, or anyone else of his stature, to be someone they are not. The risk of being disappointed is huge because simply put, artists, athletes and entertainers overall don’t owe the world anything outside of what they became famous for.</p> <p>Here's Lil Wayne, a man who clearly doesn’t want to speak about political issues, being asked to be as outspoken as some of his peers like Jay Z, Kendrick Lamar, T.I. and Common, who have spoken on BLM-related issues this year within their music, performances and social media.</p> <p>In an age where Black people feel like lesser beings (for obvious reasons, including umpteen senseless killings and the hands of policemen), it would help to have a figure as big as Lil Wayne join the fray as an outspoken representative. How impactful would it be to see all those Caucasian faces at a Lil Wayne show yelling “Black Lives Matter” or rallying behind the cause in a significant way? Very.</p> <p>It hurts the cause and the culture to see Wayne throw up a Blood flag before tossing his snapback cap into the BLM ring. Later on Wednesday, Wayne issued an apology of sorts for his ill-conceived remarks, which also followed him being questioned about his misogyny.</p> <p>"When the reporter began asking me questions about my daughter being labeled a bitch and a hoe, I got agitated,” Wayne told <a type="internal">TMZ</a>. “From there, there was no thought put into her questions and my responses. Apologies to anyone who was offended.”</p> <p>Still, what’s done is done. Many fans, followers, media outlets and social media users have already shown their disapproval of Wayne’s negligence. He was even dubbed "Donkey of the Day" by Power 105. 1 radio jock Charlemagne The God just hours after the interview segment was released. According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2016/11/04/lil-wayne-black-lives-matter-nightline-interview/" type="external">TMZ</a>, Wayne also fired his publicists after the Nightline episode aired.</p> <p>That old adage made famous by Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man continues to reign supreme: "With great power comes great responsibility.” Each time Wayne turns down an opportunity to speak up for his race or peters off from the conversations with easy outs like “I’m not even into it enough to give an opinion,” he seems to carelessly swagger away from a hefty job that critics want him to want. Maybe he’s afraid that being outspoken will hurt his bottom line and business dealings. Or maybe he just doesn’t want to be bothered.</p> <p>This isn’t a plea for his fans to cut Wayne some slack. For those angry at the rapper for his uncanny aloofness, it might be best to redirect your energy. As disappointed as you are that Lil Wayne chooses not to express sociopolitical views that encourage activism and justice for Black America, try doing everything in your power to propel and uplift the voices that do -- like a <a type="internal">Common</a>, who is actually releasing a hard-hitting, BLM-addressing album called Black America Again today (Nov. 4).</p> <p>That’s a guy who, like many others, recognizes his power and is ready to fully utilize it. Lil Wayne isn’t -- yet. But to be clear, he doesn’t owe it to anyone to be like Muhammad Ali, whose words against injustice packed punches that rivaled those he threw as a boxer or Maya Angelou, who used her poetry to help others rise. Continue to expect street-savvy, colorful raps that top the charts and, sure, hope for more. Anything else from him would be a welcome bonus. Some people, for whatever their reasons may be, don’t want to wear that cape. Though it would be nice if Lil Wayne did.</p></article>

And that was because the professors conducting the study only went back 70 years.</p> <p>And now, after eight years of <a type="internal">Mr. Obama</a> wagging his big legal finger at “Stupid America,” we finally have a president who actually understands the Constitution and means to uphold it.</p> <p>• Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com and on Twitter, @charleshurt.</p> <p>The Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im, our third-party provider.

(WJLA/Q McCray) <a type="internal"/> Police investigating report that DC police car hit a boy on his bicycle, then drove off. (WJLA/Q McCray) <p>WASHINGTON ( <a type="internal">WJLA</a>) - People in the Park View neighborhood are upset with D.C. police because they say two officers left the scene after hitting an 11-year-old on a bike.</p> <p>“What, police are just going to hit a child and leave him there?” asked witness Patricia Burnett.</p> <p>It was just before 8 p.m. Thursday. According to the boy's mother, the officers were following the boy because they noticed fireworks in his back pocket and wanted to check them out. They pursued him to an alley off Sixth Street NW near Otis Place.</p> <p>“He was riding so fast and the police were driving so fast,” said Diana Jones, who was sitting outside at the time. “Once he hit that alley, we heard 'Boom!' We heard the thump.”</p> <p>Police say when the boy turned off the road he hit the wall. The boy says the patrol car damaged his bicycle.</p> <p>No one we spoke to saw the impact, only the aftermath.</p> <p>“The little boy was pinned against the wall with a bike,” Jones added.</p> <p>“They were outside the car and they jumped back in the car and just took off,” Burnett said.</p> <p>“He was very scared,” Jones described. “He was very nervous and his leg was bleeding.”</p> <p>Their question remains, why leave the scene when they knew the boy was hurt?</p> <p>“Anyone could see this was a child,” Jones said. “And you hit him and you left him there … and you’re the law?”</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police Department released a statement that reads, in part:</p> <q>
 "While we are glad the juvenile was not seriously injured in this incident, we are taking these allegations involving one of our officers extremely seriously. </q> <q>
 "MPD's Internal Affairs Bureau is conducting a full investigation to determine exactly what happened and whether proper procedures were followed." </q></article>

Local officials continue to closely monitor the situation and will provide additional details as they are available."</p> <p>President Donald Trump condemned the violence in Charlottesville hours before he addressed the incident during a press conference in New Jersey on Satursday afternoon saying:,"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides."</p> <p>Watch Trump during Saturday's presser on ABC7's Facebook Live below:</p> <p>First Lady Melania Trump tweeted out this response to the events in Charlottesville, asking for people to communicate without hate in their hearts.</p> <p>Former President Bill Clinton reiterated the first lady's point, writing that "even as we protect free speech," Americans must "condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy."</p> <p>Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also posted to social media, calling the views of the nationalist marchers"repugnant" and "vile."</p> <p>He added he hoped that the violence would "serve to unite Americans" against bigotry.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton said in a tweet that her "heart was in Charlottesville" and with all those feeling unsafe.</p> <p>Virginia Senator Mark Warner released the following statement:</p> <p>David Duke, the former KKK leader, was at the rally earlier in the day, saying they were going to "fulfill the promises of Donald Trump."</p> <p>Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, Charlottesville officials and local representatives held a press conference telling white nationalists to "go home."</p> <p>The University of Virginia Medical Center was preparing to possibly treat patients on a "natural disaster" scale because of the event.</p> <p>Police say others in the crowd were using pepper spray.

We will strive to ensure the day does not erupt into violence, and we will redouble our efforts to remain civically engaged so that darkness does not obscure our light.”</p> <p>The organizers say they're demonstrating against moving a statue of confederate general Robert e.

	<article id="0001136" published-at="2017-07-18" title="At This Point, I Don’t Care Why You Still Support This President"><p>I care deeply about people.</p> <p>My efficacy and usefulness as a pastor and caregiver (and as a decent member of humanity), is predicated on knowing how people’s hearts work, the way they think, how they respond to fear, what motivates and hurts them. Understanding human beings is my life’s work. It is the work of every one of us striving for empathy regardless of profession or placement.</p> <p>There are times though, when people’s actions are so profoundly damaging to others, that asking why isn’t the most pressing question; moments when to belabor that question would be irresponsible to those at risk. When you come upon someone in the street inflicting violence on another human being, your first priority is to provide care for the injured, to protect others by moving them out of harm’s way, and to stop the violent act in progress. Only then is seeking to understand the motivations of the aggressor helpful. Only then do you ask, “Why would someone do this?” In the middle of the fray, when people are in danger—there isn’t time.</p> <p>People are in danger, in these moments.</p> <p>Right now I’m not interested in knowing why those who still support this President do so, not because they don’t matter or I don’t see their worth or because their stories are of no interest to me—but simply because other people’s lives and families and personal safety are in the balance—and those people merit my attention and urgency. The Jesus of my faith tradition was a shepherd. Yes he cared for the sheep, but he had to pushback hard against the wolves of the world to do it.</p> <p>Talking to embittered people right now and trying to understand their motivations may help explain the rationale for their destructive choices, but it does nothing to protect those affected by their choices, those who don’t have the luxury of waiting around for an answer, those who don’t have the privilege of time.</p> <p>And so in these moments, rather than trying to understand why someone would possibly advocate to take away a sick person’s healthcare—I am going to fight on behalf of the sick person and demand that all people be cared for under the laws of this land.</p> <p>Rather than asking why someone would want to take away an LGBTQ person’s right to marry or why they’d want to make them feel unwelcome in their church or to feel threatened in a bathroom—I’m going to loudly affirm their right to love and worship and urinate as they desire.</p> <p>Instead of trying crack the complex code that drives someone to persecute peaceful Muslims simply for pursuing their chosen faith tradition—I’m going to stand with Muslims and declare their inherent worth and the beauty of their spirituality.</p> <p>Rather than trying to help you process why saying “Black lives matter” is such a hardship to you and the implications of your refusal—I’m going to go ahead and tell you that they matter to me.</p> <p>And so it isn’t that I don’t respect those doing these things, or that their hearts and their fears and their motivations and hurts don’t matter—believe me they do. It’s just that right now, there are more urgent needs: rescuing imperiled people from the fruit of their bad decisions and the fallout of their malicious choices.</p> <p>In these moments, I’m not really interested in whatever toxic cocktail of bad theology, fear, life experience, nationalism, and personality that have created their responses—as I am helping people who are made vulnerable by their responses. I’d like to uncover and care for the heart of the bully, but in this hour I need to defend the bodies and souls of the bullied.</p> <p>So with all due respect, if you’re still supporting this hateful, reckless, malignant President, and still applauding and blessing the actions that cause incredible harm to millions of Americans—I’m not particularly interested in figuring out why you’re doing that today. One day I will, but right now I’d rather make sure people don’t die because they get cancer, or commit suicide because they feel unloved, or are forced from a country they love and deserve to live in.</p> <p>Yes, if you support this President and the sickness he’s spreading I’d really like to one day understand you, but on behalf of those so endangered because of them—first I want to stop the bleeding.</p></article>

The crux of the dead journalists investigation was how then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton influenced the transaction to be finalized, but only AFTER her husband Bill was paid $500,000 for giving a speech in Moscow.</p> <p>The Russia Consulate General’s office in New York City was contacted by Wall Street Journal reporter/editor Joseph Rago who requested a Thursday (20 July) in person interview with consular officials regarding an upcoming article he was preparing on Hillary Clinton and her links to Russia. Rago failed to attend the meeting and was later discovered dead in his apartment of as yet “unknown causes” just hours prior to this meeting occurring.</p> <p>Joseph Rago was a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter whose expertise was in the health care field. His stated purpose for this meeting was his investigating Hillary Clinton’s links to the 2014 sale of Veropharm (one of Russia’s largest medical companies) to the American medical giant Abbott Laboratories.</p> <p>Critical to note about Abbott Laboratories acquiring Veropharm, is that the deal was FINALIZED on December 12, 2014; 9 months AFTER Sanctions were imposed upon Russia. It may interest some to know that Russian sanctions could be "Waived" . . . . by the State Department, for instance!</p> <p>This takeover of Veropharm was structured to evade the Obama regime sanctions against Russia, and was accomplished by a US shell company named Kew Garden Hills, LLC -- registered in Delaware –and-- Hillary Clinton’s home State of New York -- acquiring approximately 98% of Veropharm shares—and then that shell company, Kew Garden Hills, LLC, being bought by Abbott Laboratories.</p> <p>Interestingly, Kew Garden Hills, LLC, has no officer, directors, or even corporate information listed in the S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence database; a strange fact for a firm involved in a multi-billion dollar US/foreign pharmaceutical acquisition. Here, check the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=270682413" type="external">S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence data</a> for yourself.</p> <p>Handling this transaction, was the Russian investment bank Renaissance Capital — who are noted for their having paid former President Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech he gave before their top executives in Moscow.</p> <p>Rago told Russian consular officials that he had documents linking Hillary Clinton to both Abbott Laboratories and Kew Garden Hills, so it was believed by them that this was the line of inquiry he was going to pursue during his requested meeting — which never took place because Rago turned up dead.</p> <p>The mysterious death of the 34-year-old Joseph Rago, follows by less than 2 weeks the "suicide" of another Hillary Clinton linked person named Renwick Haddow—a top former Haitian government official who ended up with a bullet in his head just a week prior to his testifying against Hillary Clinton in a Miami, Florida, courtroom.</p> <p>These facts beg the question: Was Wall Street Journal Editor/Reporter Joseph Rago killed to prevent publication of his Hillary Clinton-Russia story?</p> <p>My initial coverage of the death of Joseph Rago, <a type="internal">HERE</a></p></article>

	<article id="0001147" title="In To Kill A Mockingbird, what is a quote that proves that Tom Robinson was not involved in the murder because he is not left handed?"><p>Tom Robinson could not have beaten up Mayella Ewell because he is crippled on his left side.</p> <p>Early in the trial, Atticus establishes that Mayella was attacked by a left handed person, and that Bob Ewell is indeed left handed.</p> <q> <p>Atticus was trying to show… that Mr. Ewell could have beaten up Mayella. …If her right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to show that a left-handed person did it. (ch 17)</p> </q> <p>Scout is not impressed. She figures that Tom Robinson could just as easily be left handed, and then there is no reason for all of the fuss. After all, she is a child. She can follow most of the proceedings, but she does not see the bigger picture.</p> <p>We see that Tom Robinson is crippled when they try to swear him in and he can’t keep his left hand on the Bible.</p> <q> <p>Thomas Robinson reached around, ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it. He guided his arm to the Bible and his rubber-like left hand sought contact with the black binding. As he raised his right hand, the useless one slipped off the Bible and hit the clerk's table. (ch 19)</p> </q> <p>Tom could not possibly have attacked Mayella Ewell. Since Atticus went to so much trouble to demonstrate that she was attacked by a left handed person, it did not take much to get the jury’s attention when they saw that Tom could not use his left hand.</p> <p>Unfortunately, being physically unable to commit the crime was not enough for the jury. It was still a black man’s word against a white woman’s.</p> <p>While Mayella is testifying that Tom Robinson assaulted and raped her, Atticus asks Mayella to identify her perpetrator. Scout recalls seeing Tom Robinson stand up for the first time and notices his obvious handicap. Scout says,</p> <q> <p>"He looked oddly off balance, but it was not from the way he was standing. His left arm was fully twelve inches shorter than his right, and hung dead at his side. It ended in a small shriveled hand, and from as far away as the balcony I could see that it was no use to him." (Lee, 188)</p> </q> <p>The audience and the community of Maycomb know that Tom Robinson cannot use his left hand at all. The fact that Mayella was beaten predominately on the right side of her face indicates that the perpetrator lead almost exclusively with his left hand. Mayella also had bruises the entire way around her neck, which means that somebody with two good hands must have choked her. All of the circumstantial evidence suggests that Tom Robinson is innocent and that Mayella's father, instead, assaulted his daughter.</p> <p>During Atticus's closing remarks, he mentions that this case is as simple as black and white and explains Mayella's reasoning for accusing Tom Robinson of rape. Atticus then mentions the evidence which suggests that Bob Ewell assaulted his daughter, given the fact that he is left-handed and Tom Robinson is handicapped. Atticus tells the jury,</p> <q> <p>"We don’t know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left."

	<article id="0001148" published-at="2017-05-30" title="Parents sue San Diego schools over CAIR ‘anti-Islamophobia’ lessons"><p>SAN DIEGO, Calif. – Numerous parents are suing the San Diego school district over an anti-Islamophobia campaign they believe is a “politically correct solution to a problem that does not exist,” attorney Charles LiMandri said.</p> <p>LiMandri represents six parents who sued the school district because they believe the campaign bestows special protections for Muslim students and favors their religion over others, the <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/national/san-diego-schools-sued-over-anti-islamophobia-campaign/article_ca25cb3c-8c72-5077-bcc3-5b060ce41c98.html" type="external">Associated Press</a> reports.</p> <p>“No one is saying we have to have expensive, protracted litigation,” LiMandri said. “There can be a more commonsense approach to this where all students can be protected and no students are being favored to the disadvantage of anyone else.”</p> <p>“It’s our position that the anti-bullying policies should protect all students regardless of ethnicity and affiliation, and they shouldn’t be singling out any religious group for special treatment, as they seem to be doing here,” he said.</p> <p>The San Diego Unified School District’s new plan to combat bullying of Muslim students, approved in a 4-0 vote in April, adds more lessons on Islam to the curriculum to foster “understanding.” Those lessons are created in collaboration with the Council of American-Islamic Relations, which LiMandri and parents believe is working “to change American society and advance radical Islam,” the attorney told the <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sd-me-islamaphobia-lawsuit-20170523-story.html" type="external">San Diego Union-Tribune</a>.</p> <p>According to the AP:</p> <p>The multiyear plan includes ensuring staff calendars include Muslim holidays, reviewing library materials on Muslim culture, providing resources to teachers and engaging in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations.</p> <p>The district also plans to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture, create “safe spaces” for students and train staff about Muslim culture. The district is reviewing internal staff calendars to make sure Muslim holidays are recognized.</p> <p>The move to protect Muslim students stems in part from a CAIR report from 2015 that allegedly found more than half of California Muslim students have been bullied because of their religion. District data also showed seven bullying incidents between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2016, though data doesn’t reveal which religions were targeted.</p> <p>“That’s a relatively small number and it does not warrant or justify a wholesale change in the school district or its curriculum,” said LiMandri, who filed the federal lawsuit last Tuesday.</p> <p>“It appears to us that this is a politically correct type of solution looking for a problem,” he told the Union-Tribune. “If Muslim students are being bullied, stop the bullying. But you don’t need to implement a program that is favoring Muslim students or one religion over another.”</p> <p>SDUSD officials would not comment on the pending litigation, but have defended the special campaign to combat alleged Muslim bullying that they claim is “pervasive and vastly underreported,” according to the <a href="http://timesofsandiego.com/education/2017/05/27/parents-sue-sdusd-over-anti-bullying-muslim-policy/" type="external">Times of San Diego</a>.</p> <p>“San Diego Unified does not favor any religion over another,” district director of family and community engagement Stan Anjan wrote in an email to the Union-Tribune in February. “We welcome all students from all faiths within our school community.”</p> <p>The parents’ lawsuit alleges the district is violating students’ constitutional rights by favoring one religion over another, but does not seek monetary relief. Instead, LiMandri said parents want the district to ditch its affiliation with CAIR and work with parents to create an anti-bullying campaign that protects all students and isn’t centered on specific religions.</p> <p>Sponsored</p></article>
	<article id="0001149" published-at="2017-07-05" title="LIMBAUGH: &quot;It is the End of CNN&quot;"><p>By <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/07/05/limbaugh-end-cnn/" type="external">Rush Limbaugh</a></p> <p>Hey, let me ask you a question, folks. How many people over the course of your life, over the course of the recent past, months, years, how many people do you know that constantly complain about the media? Everybody, right? Everybody’s always complaining about the media. So over this past weekend I had somebody say, “Do you believe what Trump is doing to CNN?”</p> <p>I said, “What do you mean what Trump is doing to CNN? It’s not what Trump is doing to CNN. It’s what CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post are doing to Trump!”</p> <p>So many people have complained to me about the media for all of my life, the entire portion of my life that I’ve been doing this program. “Something’s got to be done. We’ve got to do something. Why doesn’t somebody do something about the media?” And here comes Donald Trump doing something about the media and people are getting nervous. Not everybody. Some people are obviously very supportive and happy about this.</p> <p>I think it was last week or the week before, I forget which, but I openly stated on this program that we are witnessing the decline and eventual demise of CNN. And that statement was picked up by several in the Drive-By Media, and panels were assembled to discuss my premise. “Do you really think,” it was asked on Fox News, “do you really think this could be the end of CNN?” It is the end of CNN.</p> <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/07/05/limbaugh-end-cnn/" type="external"/> <p>My point about this, a lot of people are nervous. Trump supporters are nervous about the tweet. Not everybody, but some Trump supporters are nervous about the tweeting and they’re nervous about him taking on CNN. For everybody who’s wanted something done about the media, this is what it looks like. For everybody’s who’s complained about “inside-the-Beltway-itis” and how it happens and says we need to drain the swamp or whatever, this is what it looks like.</p> <p>It was never gonna be pretty. It was never going to appear rational or normal. I mean, this is a huge battle taking place that Donald Trump is waging single-handedly. Now, he’s got his supporters out there, don’t misunderstand. The social media army is out there supporting, and he’s not alone in this. But in terms of electoral politics he pretty much is alone in this, and he continues to take it to them. And they clearly do not know how to deal with Trump.</p> <p>When I saw this, I was jealous. I was jealous that I didn’t do this. The video of Trump body slamming a CNN logo. I said, “This is great.” Trump didn’t do it. He just retweeted it. But it was clever, it was funny, and it illustrated once again that modern-day journalism and modern-day liberalism have zero sense of humor. The serious outrage that this was met with is highly illustrative of just where modern-day liberalism is and who they really are.</p> <p>I mean, CNN literally went bat crazy over this. They were acting like this is a direct assault on all members of the media. This is promoting violence against the media. Meanwhile, the only people being shot out there are Republicans. The only people being shot are Republicans, and they are deranged supporters of liberals like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, and they are listening to all the rhetoric that the Drive-By Media, including CNN, is using to make them insane, to rev them up.</p> <p>Here comes a guy on our side of the aisle using clever satire and parody, putting the CNN logo over the face of Vince McMahon, a video tape of Trump at a Wrestlemania a long time ago, CNN logo. (laughing) CNN can’t take it. CNN goes bonkers, claiming that this is going to cause violence against journalists. Meanwhile, the only violence taking place is against Republicans, and it is with guns, and it’s being perpetrated by deranged followers of left-wing news such as CNN, the New York Times, the Huff and Puffing Post, you name it.</p> <p>I thought it was hilarious and funny. But it made some people nervous is my point. I saw a lot of people over the weekend and they said, “It’s just not presidential.” I said, “Look, the problem is Trump didn’t start this.” And I reminded every one of these people how every time I’ve talked to them over the years, at one point or another there’s widespread complaining about the media. And there’s always somebody in the group, “Somebody’s gotta do something.” Well, somebody is. And this is what it looks like.</p> <p>This is exactly what it looks like, whether you’re taking on the media or whether you’re taking on any other branch of the Washington ruling class or establishment. I think while people are aware of the dislike and the unpopularity of establishmentarians of Donald Trump, I don’t think people have a full-fledged correct understanding of the sheer, raw hatred for Trump that they have. And that kind of hatred that they are carrying with them every day is dangerous. It’s destructive. It’s distorting. It is almost dehumanizing in a way.</p> <p>Hat tip: <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/07/05/limbaugh-end-cnn/" type="external">Jeff Poor</a></p></article>

 QOTD: "You know this investigation is full of leaks, did you ever wonder why, of all the things in this investigation the only thing that's never been leaked is the fact that the President was not personally under investigation?" -- <a type="internal">Sen. Marco Rubio</a> </q></article>
	<article id="0001152" published-at="2017-05-20" title="YOU WANT LEAKS? Let’s Give Them Leaks"><p>The nonstop (and completely fraudulent) accusations leveled against the Donald Trump since his candidacy was announced have now reached a crescendo.</p> <p>We're more than 100 days in to the new administration and we're still waiting for evidence that a single person in the Trump camp "colluded" with the Russians on a topic more serious than the best brand of vodka.</p> <p>In fact, thanks to the liberal authors of the new bestseller <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553447084/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0553447084&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=badblue04-20&amp;linkId=89fac55c041c6276a983dec2cdcdf368" type="external">Shattered</a>, we now know that the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/04/21/shattered-revelation-clinton-campaign-hatched-russian-hacking-narrative-24-hours-after-hillarys-loss/" type="external">Clinton camp invented the collusion tale</a> to help explain their devastating loss. The media, despite the progressive provenance of the story,</p> <p>The New York Times and The Washington Post continue to publish coordinated <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2017/05/19/nyt-and-wapo-coordinate-dual-strikes-against-president-as-trump-departs-for-trip/" type="external">leaks by "unnamed sources"</a> intended to wound the president. Their efforts have set the Beltway establishment all atwitter.</p> <p>They sing a siren song of impeachment and criminal charges, twin aspirations as delusional as they are unachievable.</p> <p>Trump isn't going anywhere. Further, regular Americans are increasingly ignoring the fraudulent and unhinged complex of Democrat-and-government media kooks.</p> <p>It is, as <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/kurtschlichter/2017/05/18/this-is-a-coup-against-our-right-to-govern-ourselves-n2328059" type="external">Kurt Schlichter</a> has described it, nothing less than a coup against elected government.</p> <q>
 It is nice... to have liberals finally come out against the abuse of executive power, misuse of classified material, and Russians. Welcome to the party, except we know you’re full of Schumer. It’s all lies, and they know it and we know it. Normal people just shake their heads and wonder why Washington is so consumed with political nonsense instead of solving problems. But then, Washington does not produce solutions. It produces only political nonsense. This is a concentrated, coordinated effort by elite insiders to take down not this president – Trump’s not the point here – but to take down us, the normal American they seek to rule. Someone came to Washington who wasn’t part of the club, and that’s intolerable. So they are desperate to expel him, and by extension, us. Every day will be a crisis, every action he takes will be the worst thing that has ever happened, and every step towards keeping his promises a crime. </q> <p>There are a few ways, however, to fight back. And fight back hard, on multiple fronts:</p> Patriots -- that is, people who believe in the American system of government who have access to the right information -- must start <a type="internal">revealing the true scope and scale of the rampant scandals</a> inflicted upon America by the Obama administration. From Hillary Clinton's illegal bathroom email server to Eric Holder's skulduggery, every day should bring a new revelation that can and will dominate headlines. There's no <a type="internal">shortage of options</a>. Carefully ignore the purveyors of fake news and anti-Trump hysteria, starting with The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. Freeze them out. Don't retweet, link to, or even read the leading purveyors of #FakeNews. <p>In short, it's time to fight fire with fire.</p> <p>Gentlemen, start your leaking!</p></article>
	<article id="0001153" published-at="2017-05-30" title="SO MUCH FOR OBAMA’S &quot;FLEXIBILITY&quot;: Missile Defense Working Despite Decades of Democrat Resistance"><a type="internal"/> <p>Tuesday’s missile defense test in which a ground-based interceptor successfully intercepted an ICBM over the Pacific was both a warning to North Korea and another indication America is back. The test was in the works before Trump took office but it comes under an administration welcoming improvements in missile defense versus the prior Obama administration that used back-channels to try to give it away to Putin and the Russians. As the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/us-successfully-shoots-down-dummy-warhead-in-missile-defense-test/article/2624484&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1496194264529000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQpnOQ63c2gdFaf6rPkvRK_J6T9w" type="external">Washington Examiner</a> reported:</p> <q> <p>The U.S. Missile Defense Agency successfully shot down a dummy warhead in space over the Pacific Ocean Tuesday during a test of a missile defense system that would protect the country from intercontinental ballistic missiles like the ones being developed by North Korea.</p> <p>"During the test, an ICBM-class target was launched from the Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands," said a statement from the agency. "A ground-based interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and its exo-atmospheric kill vehicle intercepted and destroyed the target in a direct collision."</p> </q> <a href="" type="external"/> <p>The irony of the interceptor being launched from a facility with Ronald Reagan’s name on it should escape no one. President Reagan dreamt of a multi-layered missile defense most derided as “Star Wars”. He dreamed of preventinig or deterring a nuclear attack, not merely avenging one. Perhaps he might have also had in mind the danger posed from rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran.</p> <p>We see Reagan’s legacy in the Aegis missile cruisers and destroyers that can be deploted in troubled wters around the globe. We see it in the THADD theater missile defense recently seployed to South Korea. All of this President Barack Hussein Obama opposed.</p> <p>Missile defense systems are systems which President Obama has long opposed as “Cold War” weapons. Soon after taking office, President Obama scuttled plans for ground-based missile defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p> <p>When President Obama took office in January, 2009, sitting on his desk were President George W. Bush’s plans for the deployment of ground-based missile interceptors, such as are deployed at Fort Greeely, Alaska, in Poland as well as missile defense radars in the Czech Republic, As <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials/072914-710915-russia-violates-1987-inf-missile-treaty.htm?ntt%3DPoland%2520Czech%2520Republic%2520Soviet%2520invasion%26p%3Dfull&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1496194264536000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOJrPxY-IDeVXOWifEigd-0wygkA" type="external">Investor’s Business Daily noted</a> over a year ago, President Obama had other plans and his betrayal of our allies was ironically exquisite:</p> <q> <p>Yet within hours of Medvedev's election as president in 2008, the Russian announced that Moscow would deploy SS-26 missiles in his country's enclave of Kaliningrad situated between our NATO allies Poland and Lithuania.</p> <p>He wanted the U.S. to abandon plans to deploy missile interceptors in Poland and warning radars in the Czech Republic designed to counter a future threat from Iran.</p> <p>What did President Obama do? He caved in and notified the Poles in a midnight phone call on Sept. 17, 2009 — the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland — that we were pulling the plug on that system due to Russian objections.</p> <p>Putin then watched in 2012 as Obama promised Medvedev at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, that after his re-election he would have more "flexibility" to weaken missile defense, which would help him fulfill his dream of U.S. disarmament.</p> <p>Putin know full well Obama’s weakness in responding to any foreign threat to U.S. interests and security. President Obama was the Neville Chamberlain of our time, promising “peace in our time” as he invites war with weakness, apologies, and appeasement. It was he who colluded with the Russians to threaten American national security in the “back channel” conversation with Medvedev which fell victim to an open mic.</p> </q> <p>Thanks largely to President George W. Bush and his push to fulfill President Ronald Reagan’s dream, the continental United States and overseas allies are protected against missile attack by 30 deployed long-range Ground Based Interceptors (GBI), 32 Navy ships armed with over 100 SM-3 IA interceptors, and two dozen advanced SM-3 IB interceptors, dozens of Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors, and eight X-band missile defense radars deployed abroad.</p> <p>It was Obama who proved to be Russia’s and Putin’s lapdog. Trump may have the chance to fire a second shot heard around the world, securing America’s freedom and very existence. When that pudgy little man-child gets his latest toy, just shoot that North Korean ICBM test down.</p> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/gerfingerpoken2&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1496194264545000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFioTn6Ha7HShijbIlnjdDOnCc46A" type="external">Daniel John Sobieski</a> is a free lance writer whose pieces have appeared in Investor’s Business Daily, Human Events, Reason Magazine and the Chicago Sun-Times among other publications.</p></article>
	<article id="0001154" title="According To Major What Is The Cause Of The Animals Problems">
Expert Answers <p>Old Major eloquently depicts the lot of animals. In chapter one, he says:</p> <q> <p>"Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty."</p> </q> <p>In chapter two we see what actually happens in the farm. It is a confirmation of Old Major's ranting about the evils of humans. Jones and his men confirm all that Old Major said.</p> <q> <p>"June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On Midsummer’s Eve, which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of the World over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last they could stand it no longer."</p> </q> <p>After the philosophy called "Animalism" is formed, the animals point out that men are the only animal that only consumes and never brings forth anything. Here is what the animals say:</p> <q> <p>"Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All animals are comrades."</p> </q> <p>The problem, therefore, according to Old Major is that man is selfish and only uses the animals for his own gain without any consideration.</p> <p>According to Old Major, man is the source of all the animals' problems. The animals have to wait on man for care because man gives the animals food. Yet, the only reason man is able to prosper is that the animals provide him with milk, meat, and eggs. Old Major wants the animals in charge of their own destinies--he wants to eliminate the humans from the farm because they are parasites on the system. By allowing the animals to keep everything they produce, the farm will run more efficiently and humanely. Not only does Old Major not like humans, but he dislikes anything associated with humanity, such as sleeping in beds, walking on two legs, and drinking alcohol. By taking away all the traits of humanity from the farm, Old Major hopes to create a Utopia.</p> <p>The source of much of their troubles is of course Man and the fact that man makes them labor "to the last atom of their strength," but it is in some ways not just man. It is the fact that they do not benefit from their great labor. They toil, as previous posters stated, until they have used up every last bit of their usefulness but they do not get to enjoy the fruits of that labor, man does. So the cause of their problems is the fact that Man profits from their work, he gets their eggs, their strength plows his fields, he eats the meat they grow on their bodies, etc. So once they are free of Man, "the produce of [their] labour would be [their] own.</p></article>

	<article id="0001157" published-at="2017-10-06" title="Harvey Weinstein’s ‘Casting Couch’ Sexual Harrassment Was Never Ok"><p>Within Harvey Weinstein’s incoherent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/us/statement-from-harvey-weinstein.html" type="external">statement of apology</a> in the New York Times Friday after he was accused of being a serial sexual harasser of women, among the clumsily misquoted Jay-Z lyrics was an implicit justification for his actions: “I came of age in the 60’s and 70’s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then.”</p> <p>Indeed, some of the coverage on the Weinstein bombshell took this ball and ran with it. On NPR’s <a href="http://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=556051091:556052288&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=upfirst&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=202706" type="external">Up First podcast</a> this morning, Steve Inskeep mused, “I hate to say it, it’s almost, as described, almost stereotypical behavior for a studio executive, inviting women into a room or into a hotel room and saying ‘I’ll help with your career if you do certain things for me.’”</p> <p>“Well, yeah, a lot of what people are talking about now is that notion of the casting couch and how there was almost this kind of romantic notion placed upon it for many years,” Washington Post pop culture correspondent Elahe Izadi agreed.</p> <p>As a sex worker, I admire the resilience and nerve of actresses of years past who leveraged these sorts of casting couch sexual transactions into fame. But their savvy working of a system in which their options were severely limited didn’t make that old system any less abusive. This appeal to the unspoken mores of old Hollywood — “romantic” or not — is no excuse for the sexual predation Weinstein is accused of.</p> <p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with sex as exchange. If Weinstein had made an appointment with an escort, I wouldn’t condemn him for that. Indeed, Weinstein had the cash and connections available to him to have hired an escort every evening of his life if he were so inclined; Hollywood has a thriving sex industry, according to reports <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hookers-at-cannes-40000-a-497667" type="external">in the news</a> and from the many sex workers I know. But according to the many accusations against him, Weinstein, like many abusive and powerful men before him, didn’t seem interested in making these sorts of deals with women on an even playing field. What seemed to arouse him was making no-win propositions to women who might not feel like they had a choice.</p> <p>An escort can refuse a prospective client if something doesn’t feel right. She can negotiate her rate, and she leaves when the session is over. She is employed specifically for sex and those conditions are clear, whatever the legal fiction must be about being paid for time. Whatever her economic circumstance, even as a survival sex worker, she usually doesn’t live under the sway of one client.</p> <p>But instead of choosing to have transactional sex under those sorts of more equitable conditions, Weinstein is accused of propositioning women clearly under his power — low-level assistants and struggling actresses and models. Embedded in these propositions was not only the offer on the table, but also the threat of what would happen to a woman who refused.</p> <p>“How do I get out of this room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” said Ashley Judd, recalling her thoughts twenty years ago when Weinstein pressed a massage on her in his hotel room to the New York Times. And that’s exactly it — Judd knew that alienating Weinstein and losing his backing were the economic stick behind the carrot of what Weinstein could do for her as an actress if she pleased him.</p> <p>Sex worker theorists often point out that the reason that sex work is not valued as work is because it falls under the rubric of women’s care labor — things women are meant to do for free as a condition of being women. This was the logic behind pioneering sex worker advocate Margo St James and her organization COYOTE’s early alliance with Wages for Housework in the 70s. Make no mistake, sex work is work — and as such, it should not be an unwritten contract stipulation of every employed woman’s job. It should not be expected of a terrified, underpaid assistant locked in a hotel room with her naked studio exec boss demanding she give him a massage, worried that if she refuses she will lose her job. That stark imposition of power is rightly called sexual harassment.</p> <p>“I am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career,” Lauren O’Connor wrote in her searing memo. “Harvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”</p> <p>Based on these reports, Weinstein felt entitled to the sexual labor of women like O’Connor who were trying to make a living and a career. In the context of that vast power imbalance between him and the women he harassed, he felt entitled to demand it, wielding the implicit threat of firing or the socioeconomic Hollywood death of never eating lunch in his town again.</p> <p>His entitlement used to be the unwritten law of the land, and it still is, in many places. That’s why many people — the same people who are aghast at the prospect of prostitution in conditions which are more explicit and autonomous — are still inclined to make excuses for Weinstein’s misogyny. Sex workers often comment that at least in sex work they are paid cash on the dollar for what they are coerced into doing by many legitimate employers as a condition of simply securing their jobs. Thankfully, the Times story and Weinstein’s abasement in the face of it demonstrates that many people are no longer so sanguine about sexual harassment, even the romantic Hollywood casting couch iteration of this sexual violence.</p> <p>Caty Simon is an activist, dilettante, and writer in Western Massachusetts.

Along with her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, Sharpton <a type="internal">shared details of her sexual encounter with</a> Usher during a press conference in New York on Monday (Aug. 7).</p> <p>Sharpton says she attended an Usher concert for her 19th birthday and was invited backstage because of her birthday crown. A security guard then told her Usher was interested in her and asked for her number. After the show, she claims Usher called her from a blocked number and then asked if he could come to her hotel room.</p> <p>“We spoke for a while and then we engaged in sexual contact. He never warned me about any STDs,” Sharpton claimed.</p> <p>But here’s the gag: The 21-year-old says she DOES NOT have herpes. Sharpton is suing Usher because she feels her rights were violated as he knowingly put her health at risk without her consent.</p> <p>Twitter responded to Quantasia Sharpton’s press conference and admitting she doesn’t even have herpes with a major side eye. Many believe she is lying, while others joked about everything from her looks to her name.</p> <q> <p>yall not finna sit here &amp;amp; tell ME that out of allllll the groupies , Usher picked HER .

Despite her son’s needs, the white Canadian demanded her son <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2017/06/atch-ranting-racist-woman-caught-on-video-asking-to-see-white-doctor-who-doesnt-have-brown-teeth/" type="external">only be treated by a white doctor</a>, even though none were available at the time.</p> <p>An unidentified woman in Ontario brought her son complaining of chest pains to a walk-in clinic on Sunday (Jun. 18). However, after being approached by a non-white doctor, the woman demanded to see a white doctor who “doesn’t have brown teeth and speaks English.”</p> <q> <p>“So, you’re saying, in the whole entire building there isn’t one white doctor? You’re telling me that my kid has chest pains and he’s going to have to sit here until four o’clock? Can I see a doctor that’s white, that doesn’t have brown teeth and speaks English?”</p> </q> <p>“God, what type of horrible country do I live in?” she complains after being repeatedly told the qualified doctors available don’t fit her racist demands.</p> <p>Hitesh Bhardwaj, who immigrated from India to Canada five years ago, was disturbed by the comments and began recording the woman’s outburst. The 4-minute long footage has gone viral and already amassed nearly 100,000 views.</p> <q> <p>Ha!

You are extremely rude and racist. You want to talk about ‘Paki’ people being in a hospital?

	<article id="0001161" published-at="2017-10-02" title="Tunisia Overturns Ban Preventing Muslim Women From Marrying Non-Muslim Men"><p>The right and freedom to marry, or not marry, the person of our choice is one of the most fundamental human rights today. Throughout history this has been a constant battle in a variety of different intersectional ways, and has also become an issue that can cause major divides.</p> <p>Whether it be the fight for marriage equality so that same-sex couples can enjoy the same legal benefits as heterosexual people, or the fight for interracial marriage which has put many people’s livelihood at stake throughout history, especially here in the United States during segregation. But what about people of different religions getting married? One country has taken a major step forward for women’s rights through marriage, allowing women the freedom of this important choice.</p> <p>Tunisia has just lifted a ban dating back to 1973 which forbade Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men. As <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/tunisia-lifts-ban-muslim-women-marrying-muslims-170914154657961.html" type="external">Al Jazeera</a> reports, this ruling from the country’s President Beji Caid Essebsi is part of his focus on furthering the rights of women across the country.</p> <p>“The state is obliged to achieve full equality between women and men and to ensure equal opportunities for all responsibilities,” Essebsi <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/04/we-are-an-example-to-the-arab-world-tunisias-radical-marriage-proposals" type="external">said on Tunisia’s National Women’s Day in August</a>.</p> <p>His office also released a statement about the decision, reiterating the importance of choice within marriage.</p> <p>“Congratulations to the women of Tunisia for the enshrinement of the right to the freedom to choose one’s spouse,” presidency spokeswoman Saida Garrach wrote on Facebook.</p> <p>The 1973 ban was deemed unconstitutional, <a type="internal">according to the new Tunisian Constitution</a> drafted in 2014 in the wake of the Arab Spring, which outlines a number of equal rights for women which did not exist previously. President Essebsi formed a committee led by a female lawyer and human rights activists in order to draft new laws for Muslim women.</p> <p>Before the ban was overturned, in order for a <a type="internal">Muslim woman</a> to marry someone outside of Islam, the man would have to convert and provide a certificate as proof of his newly-adopted religion. But of course, as is the norm for many countries where laws fundamentally favor men as superior beings, Muslim men were always allowed to marry non-Muslim woman.</p> <p>Although the Tunisian constitution is said to have <a type="internal">more rights for women</a>, at least on paper, there are still areas which are lacking in equality. For instance, a daughter can only inherit half of what a son is entitled to.</p> <p>“The first president of independent Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba, championed a landmark social code in 1956 that set a standard for the region by banning polygamy and granting new rights to women unheard of in the Arab world at the time. But even he didn’t dare push for equal inheritance,” explained the Al Jazeera article.</p> <p>A number of the laws which disproportionately favor men over women are looked upon positively by some religious clerics, who disapprove of the President’s decision to overturn the 1973 marriage ban. However, as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/22/this-arab-country-is-allowing-muslim-women-to-marry-non-muslim-men-thats-the-good-news/?utm_term=.016aa567f142" type="external">Washington Post reports</a>, the religious backlash may not even be the most controversial or troubling aspect of President Essebsi’s recent decisions.</p> The day before the non-Muslim marriage ban being overturned, he passed a law that has left some human rights activists concerned about his larger agenda. <p>“Tunisia’s parliament passed a reconciliation law that seeks to protect civil servants from the old regime from prosecution under the country’s Truth and Dignity Commission that is dealing with the legacy of the brutal dictatorship of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali that fell in 2011,” writes WaPo’s Paul Schemm.</p> <p>In the wake of the Arab Spring, Islamic leaders came to power initially, only to be voted out in 2014. After that, President Essebsi, who had held a number of positions in Parliament pre-revolution, came to power, promising prosperity and safety, as well as “reconciliation”, which is now being seen in the form of giving businessmen and civil servants of the old regime that now were being tried for past crimes, including torture, bribery and embezzlement, exoneration.</p> <p>Amna Guellali from the Human Rights Watch said that the marriage ban being overturned in light of the reconciliation law was “one step forward, one step back” for Tunisia.</p> <p>“For a long time, the old regime used progress on women’s rights as a fig leaf to distract from its repressive policies. By championing women’s rights while at the same time expanding impunity for acts of corruption, the Tunisian government is reminding us of how these two contrasted realities worked in the past and how women’s rights were used to whitewash a system riddled with corruption and systematic human rights violations,” <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/15/one-step-forward-one-step-back-tunisia" type="external">she wrote in a statement</a>.</p> <p>With the ushering in of a new constitution and a new government in the wake of a major revolution like that of the Arab Spring, we are no doubt going to see a lot of progressive measures tempered by moves that are seemingly regressive, as is the reconciliation law. The struggle for power is never an easy one, and throughout history, around the world, we have seen how many movements have left certain groups behind or ignored others.</p> <p>For Tunisia to truly be a bastion of women’s rights in the Middle East, equality cannot only be enshrined in legislation, it must be lived out in every sector of society. Back in July, Tunisia <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/27/tunisia-landmark-step-shield-women-violence" type="external">passed tougher laws</a>on domestic and sexual violence as well as sexual harassment in public spaces. The new laws also closed a controversial loophole which granted rapists a reprieve if they married their victims.</p> <p><a href="https://qz.com/1078458/tunisia-has-lifted-a-44-year-ban-on-women-marrying-non-muslims/" type="external">QZ.com</a> reports women now make up a sizeable percentage of the Tunisian workforce, and 75 out of 217 Parliament members. But laws that allow corrupt leaders to retain power or escape consequences show how patriarchy and privilege must be demolished in order for equality and freedom to truly be a reality for everyone. For now, the ability for Muslim women to marry whomever they choose is good news.</p></article>

His frustration over the investigation peaked in recent weeks as he began attacking Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation. Sessions, most recently a U.S. senator, was an early and ardent Trump supporter.</p> <p>“Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign. There never were,” he told the cheering crowd in West Virginia. “We didn’t win because of Russia. We won because of you.”</p> <p>Trump argued that Democrats are pushing the “totally made-up Russia story” because “they have no message, no agenda and no vision.”</p> <p>“The Russia story is a total fabrication.

Ulysses S. Grant’s alleged sin? Anti-Semitism.</p> <p>At a press conference early this week, a reporter with a local <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/08/22/new-york-city-statue-removal/" type="external">CBS station</a> asked New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio if Grant’s body should be removed or the monument removed over an infamous order he gave in the midst of the Civil War to expel Jews from a portion of the South.</p> <p>“I wonder if you think that somebody who did that, given the large number of Jews who live in New York, should be buried here New York,” the reporter asked.</p> <p>De Blasio, who has set up a panel to review statues in the city, said he did not know. But the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, has said she supports a review of the future of the majestic tomb, which sits in Riverside Park overlooking the Hudson River near Columbia University.</p> <p>It’s an unlikely controversy, as Jewish experts on Grant hold that he repented for the expulsion order and that in his term as president was a friend to the Jewish community.</p> <p>The leading expert on Grant’s expulsion of the Jews, the Brandeis University professor Jonathan Sarna, is unequivocal on what he thinks should be done with Grant’s Tomb: It should stay.</p> Library of Congress <p>“When one studies the totality of Grant’s life and actions, one discovers that he represents the fact that hatred can be overcome,” said Sarna, who has written a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/General-Grant-Expelled-Jewish-Encounters/dp/0805212337?tag=thefor03-20" type="external">book</a> on the expulsion.</p> <p>“Grant apologized for the order, and as president went out of his way to prove just how unprejudiced he had become,” Sarna said. “He appointed more Jews to public office than all previous presidents; he became the first president to attend a synagogue dedication.”</p> <p>Grant also intervened on behalf of Jews in Romania and Russia facing persecution, Sarna said.</p> <p>The expulsion order, which in theory covered parts of Kentucky, Mississipippi and Tennessee, was never fully put into effect. According to Sarna, only a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2012/03/ulysses_s_grant_and_general_orders_no_11_how_the_infamous_order_changed_the_lives_of_jews_in_america_.html" type="external">few Jews</a> were directly impacted.</p> <p>“One really sees Grant as a man who grew in every way over the course of his life and career, and at least arguably that is something we should celebrate, rather than faulting him for what he himself considered to be a great mistake,” Sarna said.</p> <p>It’s not at all clear that the city could remove Grant’s Tomb, even if it were to decide to do so: The structure is owned by the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/gegr/index.htm" type="external">National Parks Service</a>, a federal agency.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the mayor said that the panel of experts and community leaders to review the public monuments and symbols is still being put together.

President Donald Trump is intending to improve our economy by reforming new immigration laws. One of his platforms is to build a modern wall between the U.S. Mexican border. His intention is not to thoroughly stop new immigrants from coming into our country but to control illegal immigrants from coming into the United States.</p> <p>This policy has had a lot of controversy in our country, but it is only intended to keep America safe and strengthen our country. Due to the abundance of illegal immigrants coming into the United States, it is becoming a burden on our taxpayers and our social services. The amount of money we spend on illegal immigrants can be used towards providing services for our legal citizens that are in need of help.</p> <p>The current fence that is built along the border is not enough protection against immigration, because there are still many immigrants who cross it illegally every day. With President Trump's proposal, it will hopefully improve border security and save taxpayers millions of dollars. It is time to put an end to illegal immigration and come to America legally.</p> <p>Quentin Trevino, Fresno</p> Breaking News <p>Be the first to know when big news breaks</p> <p>Recaptcha requires verification.</p> <p>protected by reCAPTCHA</p> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" type="external">Privacy</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/" type="external">Terms</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" type="external">Privacy</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/" type="external">Terms</a></p></article>

	<article id="0001167" title="‹ Infinity War: 8 Rumors That Are Likely To Happen (And 7 That Are Just Too Crazy)">
6. TOO CRAZY: A NEW CAPTAIN AMERICA <p>At the end of Captain America: Civil War, the Captain ditches his Vibranium shield and goes to Wakanda away from the U.S. government and United Nations. Many people have taken this to mean that he is no longer Captain America, and they are right. The Infinity War trailer shows us Steve Rogers seemingly looking like Nomad from the comics — no star-spangled shield at all.</p> <p>Some people have theorized that this means a new hero will take up the mantle of Captain America like in the comics (Falcon and Winter Soldier being the two primary candidates). We don’t think this will happen as Marvel will want to honor the memory of Captain America and let him and the mantle itself go out in glory. Furthermore, Falcon and Bucky are still fugitives.</p> 5. LIKELY TO HAPPEN: TWO AVENGER TEAMS <p>When the Russo Brothers were considering how they were going to start Avengers: Infinity War, they said that they were going to do it by splitting the team. They did this early on in Phase 3 in Captain America: Civil War. In the end of that movie, Captain America and Iron Man went their separate ways, taking specific teams with them as well.</p> <p>Iron Man and his comrades operated as government-registered superheroes while Cap and his Secret Avengers went to Wakanda for sanctuary. When Infinity War takes place, we’d bet that Iron Man will be primarily leading one team while Cap and Black Panther will lead the other. Keep in mind that we don’t see any of Cap’s Secret Avengers interacting with Iron Man’s team (save for that Scarlet Witch and Vision romance). This would also lead to them getting their butts kicked by Thanos, because they’re fighting him while divided.</p> 4. TOO CRAZY: THE CANCERVERSE IN THE MCU <p>The Cancerverse was an interesting part of the Multiverse in the comics. Featuring darker versions of our classic heroes, it played a major role in the “Thanos Imperative” storyline, where the Mad Titan had to work alongside a group of heroes that despise him: The Guardians of the Galaxy.</p> <p>The reason we highly doubt the Cancerverse will make an appearance in the MCU is that it will be a concept admittedly difficult for general audiences to understand. On top of that, it would unnecessarily complicate an already big film. With all those characters, Marvel has to keep Avengers: Infinity War as simple as possible to allow every hero the right time to shine on the big screen. That alone will take up a lot of the movie.</p> 3. LIKELY TO HAPPEN: XANDAR’S DESTRUCTION <p>If you remember back to Guardians of the Galaxy, the central conflict of that film involved the Orb which was actually the Power Gem. After the Guardians managed to get it back from Ronan the Accuser, it was given to the Nova Corps to be faithfully protected deep within the vault of Xandar.</p> <p>In the Infinity War trailer, we see a shot of Thanos having both the Space and Power Gems in the Infinity Gauntlet. This means that he had to have gone to Xandar to steal the Gem from the Nova Corps. Considering the fact that Thanos isn’t exactly a diplomatic guy, he went into the planet guns blazing and burnt it to a crisp just to get his precious Infinity Stone. That may even be the event that tips off the Guardians to join the fight.</p> 2. TOO CRAZY: HEIMDALL WITH THE SOUL STONE <p>There was a big theory going around regarding the MCU and the Infinity Stones. Each letter of “Thanos” stood for what contained each stone. T-Tesseract, A-Aether, N-Necklace, O-Orb, S-Scepter. You might notice that the “H” is undetermined at this point. Many people have speculated that the “H” stands for Heimdall and that he contains the last stone.</p> <p>Why we’re not on board with this one is that there’s never been a whole lot of evidence to support this, including the Infinity War trailer. Instead, we think that the last stone is hidden in Wakanda somewhere. Why else would Black Panther have to engage all defenses and fight against the Mad Titan’s army of monsters? To be fair, we also haven’t had the <a type="internal">Black Panther</a> movie come out yet, so there’s still time for the MCU to reveal a stone hiding in Wakanda.</p> 1. LIKELY TO HAPPEN: SCARLET WITCH TRAINED BY DOCTOR STRANGE <p>Doctor Strange, as the Sorcerer Supreme and the omnipotent guardian of Earth, has been rumored to be the one that brings the Avengers together to fight Thanos. There are a lot of shots of him in the trailer to support this theory. However, that’s not the only contribution he is said to have among the team.</p> <p>There is a rumor floating around that he will meet Scarlet Witch. After seeing her instability and how that translates into her powers, he will train her to control her abilities and master them. While they’re not exactly the same kind of magic-users, it’d be a great scene of pure comic book fun to see these two interacting and learning from each other. It’s funny to think that Strange would be training Scarlet Witch considering that she got her powers before he did.</p> <p>Which of these do you hope actually happens? Let us know in the comments!</p></article>

	<article id="0001169" published-at="2018-08-24" title="Sen. Baldwin pushes to keep 'Buy America' in legislation">
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, (D) Wisconsin, pushed legislation with "Buy America" reform <p>(WLUK) -- President-elect Donald Trump is in the midst of his victory tour. He told the crowd in Cincinnati last week, the U.S. government has failed the interest of the American workers. And he plans to change that.</p> <p>"Buy American, hire American. We're going to do it ourselves. That'll be our new mantra," said Trump to cheers from the crowd.</p> <p>"I was heartened to hear those words," said U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin.</p> <p>On Capitol Hill, Baldwin is finding agreement with Trump - if only on the fine point of "buy America."</p> <p>Back in September, the Senate voted in favor a bill aimed to upgrade failing water systems. Baldwin included a measure requiring American made steel and iron be used on the taxpayer-funded projects.</p> <p>The move would benefit companies like Neenah Foundry and its workers.</p> <p>But Baldwin says a conflict arose last week.</p> <p>"Speaker (Paul) Ryan and House Republicans removed the provision from the water resources Development Act," said Baldwin. "It's just untenable. Stripping this 'buy America' reform I put in on the Senate side is only a giveaway, in my opinion, to foreign companies - Chinese and Russian steel producers - when we're expending taxpayer dollars."</p> <p>The water infrastructure problems took center stage during the presidential campaigns in Flint, Michigan, where lead pipes led to contaminated drinking water. Similar problems were also detected in other cities, including Green Bay.</p> <p>Critics say directing federal funds to some companies over others would be unfair.</p> <p>Ryan's office tells FOX 11 the "buy America" measure remains a "materials requirement" for certain federally-funded projects.</p> <p>Baldwin and other Democrats sent House leaders a letter pleading to keep the "buy America" requirement from the Senate bill intact for the House to vote on. Baldwin and others even turned to Twitter to try and get Trump to stand by his word.</p> <p>"He should not be silent this week as we're fighting to restore this "buy America" reform.</p> <p>So far, no tweet from Trump.</p> <p>The House has yet to vote on the measure.</p></article>
	<article id="0001170" published-at="2017-08-22" title="Alt-Right Jew: Charlottesville Was A Wake-Up Call">
Getty Images <p>Even after <a type="internal">Charlottesville</a>, I still don’t know what to think of <a type="internal">Richard Spencer</a>. It’s Saturday night and I’m watching him <a type="internal">compare</a> his movement to Zionism on Israeli TV. He’s wearing a nice shirt and I’m not surprised; the man has fine taste in clothing, especially in vests. I’d challenge anyone to name a public figure who pulls off vests better than Richard Spencer.</p> <p>As Jewish people, we can make psychic space for the rough anti-Semite, the uneducated man who hates us because he knows no better, the man in ripped jeans and rebel flag shirts. The “nerdy Nazis” with their polos, marching in Charlottesville can also be explained away, categorized, rendered less frightening. But a man who knows his vests? A man with a winning smile? This is an intrusion, a sign that the containment of the anti-Semitic virus has failed, that the good, the educated, the nuanced people of this world can no longer be assumed to be safe. No matter, though. I still tell people Richard is no Jew-hater. It’s impossible for a real anti-Semite to be so objective about Zionism, to go on Israeli TV… and to wear those nice vests.</p> <p>No one, however, really cares.</p> <p>After Charlottesville, all nuance is lost. I can’t blame my fellow Jews. The video, pictures and stories are awful. Hundreds <a type="internal">chanting</a> “Jews will not replace us,” Nazi flags, the synagogue <a type="internal">threatened</a>. However Spencer feels about Jews, he will now attract genuine anti-Semites, moreso than before, and more of his events will devolve into this. Is this what he wanted?</p> <p>We must be honest about Charlottesville. No one was there to help us. The police in Charlottesville <a href="http://reformjudaism.org/blog/2017/08/14/charlottesville-local-jewish-community-presses?utm_source=Share&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=BlogPost&amp;utm_content=Zimmerman" type="external">refused</a> to watch the synagogue, despite specific threats (they later <a type="internal">denied</a> this). Antifa, claiming that they mobilized to “protect the community,” did nothing to protect the Jewish community. Jews in Charlottesville had to rely on <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/charlottesville-police-refused-protect-synagogue-nazis-so-it-hired-armed-651260" type="external">hired guns</a>. Where were the “anti-fascists” we hear so much about? Where were the police? It seems we can only rely on ourselves.</p> <p>Jews still thinking the left has any interest in defending us against Nazis are fools. I’ve warned for quite awhile that the left will start seeing Jews as White, and the hatred and derision they pour upon white people is headed our way. There are countless vigils, teach-ins, Facebook posts from the left about Charlottesville and Nazis; few mention Jews. We feel this in our online spaces. Jews are an afterthought on social justice Twitter, an annoyance on leftist Facebook. Our concerns “get in the way” of the far more important issues for “people of color” — which of course we are not. I try to explain all of this to the Jewish race-warriors: turn our public discourse into race shaming, my peeps, and Jews will pay the price. We will always be the wrong race, under any formulation.</p> <p>Again, no one much cares anymore.</p> <p>Now I’m <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/19/544684355/bostons-free-speech-rally-organizers-deny-links-to-white-nationalists" type="external">watching</a> news from the Boston “Free Speech Rally.” Not many people showed up. They ended up <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2017/08/19/these-aerial-views-show-the-size-of-the-counter-protest-crowds-in-boston" type="external">surrounded</a> by something like 40,000 people thinking “Nazis” had arrived. I watched antifa protesters <a href="https://twitter.com/xBenJamminx/status/898940347056828417" type="external">attack</a> a woman holding an American flag. I watched a Jewish Trump supporter draped in an Israeli flag, being <a href="https://twitter.com/Corrynmb/status/898957917201678336" type="external">followed and threatened</a>. The mob acts like this is a fair fight, some kind of accomplishment. “We’ve made these people crazy,” I think to myself. Dark clouds approach on my mental horizon. Will the left ever be sane again?</p> <p>It’s not just the left, though. Public discourse is breaking down. In a liberal-verging-on-activist-left echo chamber, all nuance is lost. Antifa, a group that has for months <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/how-violence-undermined-the-berkeley-protest.html?_r=0" type="external">targeted random people</a>, destroyed property, and insulted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeXvR4ND4kY" type="external">disabled veteran</a>, is <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffreyGoldberg/status/897667217340420098" type="external">compared</a> to allied soldiers in WWII. President <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> is “called out” for refusing to condemn “White Supremacists” — and when he does, faced with even more indignation over pointing out Antifa’s violence. Some of the rhetoric is truly disgusting. Mollie Hemmingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, posted this tweet regarding Charlottesville:</p> <q>
 The argument Trump was wrong to point out problems of violent leftist mobs is better made if you don’t endorse violent leftist mobs.— Mollie (@MZHemingway) <a href="https://twitter.com/MZHemingway/status/897649969984937985" type="external">August 16, 2017</a> </q> <p>Seems reasonable, right? Not to Marc Caputo of Politico, who responded with this gem:</p> <q>
 Der Stürmer Mollie is on the same page as David Duke. <a href="https://t.co/JwQTkgopZ4" type="external">https://t.co/JwQTkgopZ4</a>— Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/897656306156400640" type="external">August 16, 2017</a> </q> <p>Oh yes, folks. David Duke. Der Stürmer. It’s worth noting that Caputo is not a recent college graduate — he’s a longtime reporter who has spent many years spent covering the Florida political scene. In this media environment, how is reasoned discussion even possible? We’re all reacting to something that wasn’t said, people who aren’t there. Mollie Hemmingway doesn’t have anything to do with David Duke or Der Sturmer, not even tangentially. So what? Marc isn’t responding to her. When thousands of people show up to beat up “Nazis” in Boston, there are no Nazis to beat up. So what? Someone has to be beat, so they just make-believe.</p> <p>A week ago I was talking to some of the local Jewish wheels. They want to know how to handle these times. My advice? “Buy several of the same kind of semiautomatic rifle, that way you have barter items and spare parts.” A woman started crying. “Be sure,” I continued, “that if you operate a Jewish school, no one looking at the playground can see the children.” Jew-haters are especially set off by watching happy Jewish children.</p> <p>It’s now early Sunday morning, long before the sun rises, and I’ve got candles lit because it feels right. I stare into the flames. So much has changed since the days of the campaign. Where did the fun go? Where’s the energy? What happened to the grand coalition of the disaffected? We voted for Trump because we knew those in power didn’t want us to. We sent a message, and now the message is gone. No one will listen to reason anymore. Antifa doesn’t care, Nazis don’t care, the media doesn’t care. I’m not a prophet and I don’t hear the voice of God, yet I can’t help but imagine Him looking down on us:</p> <p>“You put politics before Me, this is your God now, this is what you wanted.”</p> <p>I wrap my arms and head. No, this isn’t what we wanted. Never again, dear Lord, my King. I will not forget you again.</p> <p>The views and opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Forward.</p></article>

It was unusual fare for the awards show, but it was especially surprising considering that Lee is a direct descendent of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee.</p> <p>“We have made my ancestor an idol of racism, white supremacy, and hate,” Lee, 24, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/09/05/robert-e-lee-descendant-and-denouncer-quits-n-c-pastor-post-over-hurtful-reaction-to-vma-speech/?utm_term=.53c6c805a014" type="external">said</a>, referring specifically to the violent supremacists marching through Charlottesville. “As a pastor, it is my moral duty to speak out against racism, America’s original sin. Today I call on all of us with privilege and power to answer god’s call to confront racism and white supremacy head on.”</p> <p>Lee’s speech, which served to introduce Susan Bro, mother of the deceased Charlottesville counter-protester Heather Heyer, was a profound act of moral bravery.</p> <p>But today Lee, who is the great-great-great nephew of the Confederate general, <a href="http://ew.com/music/2017/09/05/robert-e-lee-descendant-vmas-backlash/" type="external">resigned as pastor</a>. Lee was serving his very first pulpit out of Duke Divinity School at Bethany United Church of Christ in North Carolina. According to Lee, negative reactions to the VMAs speech by some members of the church concerned Lee’s reference to Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March, and Heather Hayer as “examples of racial justice work.”</p> <p>In a <a href="http://auburnseminary.org/rev-robert-wright-lee-iv-statement-leaving-church-speaking-white-supremacy-mtv-video-music-awards/" type="external">statement</a>, Lee apologized for the fact that “speaking out has caused concern and pain” to his church and added that he still believes “we are all called by God to speak out against hate and evil in all its many forms.” Lee resigned after the congregation decided to put his tenure to a vote. He asked that this news story not distract from “the sacred work of confronting white supremacy.”</p> <p>Jenny Singer is a writer for the Forward.

It’s America and you are free to speak your mind. I just feel it’s disrespectful to the ones who sacrificed their lives and it’s maybe the wrong platform.

Members of the San Francisco 49ers kneel during the national anthem as others stand prior to an NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017, in Glendale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Matt York) <p>WASHINGTON ( <a href="http://wjla.com/sports/content/espn-nfl-owners-considering-rule-change-to-require-players-to-stand-for-national-anthem" type="external">WJLA</a>) - The NFL is reportedly considering requiring its players to stand during the national anthem after weeks of protests from players around the league.</p> <p>ESPN says it recovered a letter allegedly sent by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to NFL teams on Tuesday.</p> <p>"Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem," Goodell says in the letter. "It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us. We also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues. The controversy over the Anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues. We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players."</p> <p>The full letter can be read below.</p> <p>The act of players demonstrating during the anthem started in the 2016 preseason when then San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem as a protest of police discrimination against people of color. Kaepernick then began kneeling during the anthem as the season progressed.</p> <p>Other players followed his example, either kneeling, sitting or raising a fist during the song.</p> <p>These actions drew criticism from those who deemed the players' actions unpatriotic or disrespectful.</p> <p>The movement has grown even larger in 2017 after <a type="internal">President Donald Trump proposed firing any players who kneeled during the anthem</a>.</p> <p>Some fans have said they will no longer watch NFL games if the protests continue and on Sunday, <a href="http://wjla.com/news/nation-world/trump-says-he-told-pence-to-leave-nfl-game-if-players-kneeled" type="external">Vice President Mike Pence left a game</a> between the Indianapolis Colts and 49ers after multiple 49ers players took a knee.</p> <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones made headlines when he said that his <a href="http://wjla.com/sports/content/jerry-jones-cowboys-will-not-play-if-they-disrespect-flag" type="external">players will not play if they disrespect the flag.</a></p> <p>"There is no room here if it comes between looking non-supportive of our players and of each other or creating the impression that you're disrespecting the flag, we will be non-supportive of each other," Jones said, according to The Associated Press.

Foreign governments and corporations would no longer be able to donate.</p> <p>The changes come as Clinton continues to face political attacks on the foundation, and on whether such a large outside organization can co-exist while being run by the family of a major public official. The changes were announced on the same day that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump <a type="internal">called</a> for the foundation to be entirely disbanded, saying it was the “most corrupt enterprise in political history.”</p> <p>But in announcing the potential changes, Bill Clinton also launched a spirited defense of the foundation’s work across the globe. He noted that broad progress on the environment, education and public health had been made, including millions of people getting access to affordable drugs to fight HIV thanks to the Clinton Health Access Initiative — covering more than half of the adults under treatment today.</p> <p>And he dismissed suggestions that the foundation should be shuttered if Hillary Clinton becomes president.</p> <p>“While my role in that work will change, the work itself should continue because so many people are committed to it and so many more are relying on it,” he wrote.</p> <p>Bill Clinton announced that he would step down from the foundation’s board and stop fundraising for the organization if his wife is elected. And the foundation will be renamed, from the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation to simply the Clinton Foundation.</p> <p>Furthermore, he said the foundation would begin transitioning some of its international work — much of which relies on bilateral aid programs from foreign governments — to other organizations that are not government-run.</p> <p>The Clinton Global Initiative, which Bill Clinton founded in 2005 to gather global leaders from government and the private sector to tackle broad issues, would no longer meet following its September meeting.</p> <p>The foundation <a type="internal">indicated</a> it would be overhauling operations if Hillary Clinton were to become president earlier this month.</p></article>

	<article id="0001183" published-at="2018-04-06" title="Christians: Privileged or persecuted?"><p>According to a seminar at George Washington University, I’ve been getting “Christian Privilege” all my life! That’s on top of my patriarchal, white, gluten/peanut tolerating privilege!</p> <p>But is that really true? Or is it one of those #FirstWorldProblems things?</p> <p>Globally, the idea of Christian privilege is pure sophistry. Christians are the recipients of up to 80 percent of religious persecution around the planet, making it the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/14/christians-most-persecuted-group-in-world-as-vicious-attacks-grow.html" type="external">most persecuted religion in the world</a>. Worldwide, Christianity is the opposite of privileged unless you consider it a privilege that the day your faith is discovered in Somalia is the day you die.</p> <p>“But we’re just talking about the evil empire – the United States, David.”</p> <p>OK – let’s consider that. Christians in the United States don’t blow people up; they don’t riot in the streets; they do billions of dollars of good work. But they are still persecuted. Examples:</p> Facebook refused an ad from a Catholic University because it was too violent – <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2018/04/facebook-pulls-180-after-banning-jesus-on-cross/" type="external">it pictured a statue of Jesus on the cross.</a> Obama tried to force Hobby Lobby and The Little Sisters of the Poor to fund abortifacients against their Christian belief. Horrible people those “Little Sisters” – caring for the elderly poor and destitute as if they were family. In 2012, Chick-fil-A owner Truett Cathy said he supports biblical marriage: one man/one woman. The mainstream media went ballistic, and his restaurants were vandalized and received threats of violence from homosexual groups. A case is currently before the Supreme Court regarding a baker. The baker will sell homosexuals cupcakes, cakes and brownies, but, believing that same-sex marriage is a sin, won’t bake cakes for their marriage ceremonies. So Colorado is trying to force him to violate his religious beliefs. <p>None of that sounds “privileged” to me. One could argue that Islam is much more privileged that Christianity these days.</p> <p>After 9/11, when Muslim terrorists killed 3,000 Americans, U.S. leaders went to GREAT PAINS to distance Islam from those guys who claimed to kill in the name of Islam. After 9/11:</p> We were told we must watch out for “Islamophobia.” “Phobia” refers to an irrational fear – like the fear that one of the 100 million Muslims sympathetic to terrorism might fly a plane into a building in the name of their religion. Crazy. George W. Bush, confronted with this act of terror, declared, “Islam means peace.” Wrong. Who advised this guy? It’s not a secret – Islam literally means, “submission.” I guess “peace” sounded better. Both Bush and Obama refused to say the term, “radical Islam.” It’s not radical Christianity (they handle snakes) or radical Krishnas (used to accost you with love and bald heads in airports) or radical Girl Scout cookie pushers that are the problem. Obama invited dozens of <a href="https://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/radical-islamists-made-hundreds-white-house-visits/" type="external">real Islamic terror suspects</a> to the White House. Obama criticized Christianity for the Crusade, which happened 1,000 years ago, but never criticized Islam for the terror of today. Trump banned travel from seven of 50 Muslim majority countries (they were terror incubators); the mainstream media was apoplectic calling it a “Muslim Travel Ban.” Weakest ban in history since it left out 43 countries. “All Muslims are BANNED. Except for 86 percent of them. But it’s BIG BEAUTIFUL BAN.” <p>Bottom line?</p> <p>Islamic terrorists kill 3,000 Americans, and everyone runs around making sure no one offends Islam.</p> <p>Faithful Christians refuse to pay for abortion drugs or believe in biblical marriage, and they are the Taliban and must be destroyed!</p> <p>So in one sense in 2018, anyone that goes around claiming Christians have special “privilege” is cloistered from reality.</p> <p>But, I must admit, here in the U.S., every person is a recipient of a specific type of Christian privilege. Here’s the truth. The United States is:</p> the greatest country in the world, the safest country in the world, the most prosperous country in the world, the most secure country in the world, and the freest country in all of history. <p>Why? Because of the Christian values and principles that informed its founding and governance. Christian values led to the forming of a country unlike any in history – dedicated to protecting the individual’s right to freedom and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p> <p>“But what about all the atrocities the U.S. has committed?” America has her flaws, but those flaws exist in spite of Christianity, when the U.S. has not fully embraced Christian values. And we work hard to right the wrongs: Slavery was the norm around the world, and we were the only nation in human history to fight a bloody civil war to end it.</p> <p>In every election cycle, Barbra Streisand and her buddies declare they will leave the country if the conservative or Christian or Republican wins. And we wait, and we wait, but THEY NEVER LEAVE. THEY PROMISED! WHY WON’T THEY LEAVE?</p> <p>Because there’s nowhere better to go.</p> <p>Instead of “Christian privilege” seminars, there ought to be seminars everywhere on how you should thank your lucky stars if you’re an atheist, your lucky charms if you’re a witch, or whoever it is you worship, that you live in a country that was founded by Christians and/or those who respected Christianity and the Bible. Because you are more blessed than the 95-plus percent of the world’s population that lives elsewhere. You have freedom and liberty unlike any other people in history.</p></article>

It's an attempt to restore gatekeepers who have a bias as the ultimate arbiters of truth."</p> <p>"If these organizations begin questioning articles and penalizing outlets for simple political disagreements rather than outright factual falsities, conservatives will have to go elsewhere for their news," Shapiro added.</p> <p>The Daily Caller also criticized this decision and called one of the fact-checkers, Snopes, an "unreliable liberal fact-checker." It also accused liberal journalists of branding legitimate conservative news agencies as producers of fake news.</p> <p>Paul Joseph Watson, a popular conservative political commentator, called the movement "a group of incredibly biased left-wing fake news outlets that will bury dissenting opinions."</p> <p>Facebook's move regarding the proliferation of <a type="internal">fake news</a> on the site came up after observers noted that this phenomenon may have swayed a number of people into voting for President-elect Donald Trump.</p> <p>Accusations of <a type="internal">fake news</a> have been used by both sides of the political spectrum, with some people arguing that a particular news is fake just because it does not agree with what they believe in.</p></article>

	<article id="0001187" published-at="2017-09-18" title="What The Facebook Search Warrant Means For Mueller’s Russia Probe"><p>It’s not surprising that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is interested in the role Facebook played in Russia’s campaign to influence the 2016 election. Yet, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-gave-special-counsel-robert-mueller-more-details-on-russian-ad-buys-than-congress-1505514552" type="external">news</a> that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/15/media/facebook-mueller-ads/index.html" type="external">broke</a> over the weekend that his team had obtained a search warrant to access information about Facebook’s recently disclosed Russia-linked ad spending is the clearest sign yet of the breadth of his probe, the pace at which its moving along and what kind of case he might be trying to build, regardless of whether he ultimately brings criminal charges.</p> <p>“This is not a wild goose chase, it’s not just a fishing expedition. [It shows] that there is good reason to be believe that someone committed criminal behavior, we just don’t know who that was and exactly what the behavior was,” Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor and former federal prosecutor, told TPM.</p> <p>“Given the recent revelations, it’s hard to keep calling this a witch hunt,” she later added.</p> <p>That Mueller had sought a search warrant for information about Russia ad buys on Facebook was alluded to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-gave-special-counsel-robert-mueller-more-details-on-russian-ad-buys-than-congress-1505514552" type="external">first in a Wall Street Journal report</a>Friday evening, and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/15/media/facebook-mueller-ads/index.html" type="external">confirmed by CNN on Saturday.</a></p> <p>Getting a search warrant is a higher bar for Mueller to clear than a grand jury subpoena, another tool Mueller is using to obtain documents and testimony.</p> <p>“To get a search warrant like that, you have to show a judge that there is probable cause that evidence of a crime will be found at the location,” said Harvard Law professor and former federal prosecutor Alex Whiting. “The fact that they got a search warrant shows that the investigation is moving forward and that they have found some evidence of crimes.”</p> <p>Furthermore, former federal investigators tell TPM that it’s likely that the warrant Mueller obtained is tailored and focused in a way only possible if you have a good idea of what you think you’ll find.</p> <p>“It has to be particularly described, what he is looking for,” said Asha Rangappa, who was a counter-intelligence agent for the FBI and now a Yale Law School professor. “A judge isn’t going to sign off some sort of blanket warrant that tells Facebook to turn over everything.”</p> <p>Facebook <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/" type="external">admitted in a blog post</a> earlier this month, before the revelation of a Mueller search warrant, that it had identified $100,000 in spending on about 3,000 ads purchased by 470 “inauthentic” accounts “likely operated out of Russia.”</p> <p>It wasn’t clear exactly what prompted Facebook, which is notoriously secretive about its internal operations, to come clean on what it found. Congressional investigators running their own Russia probes have since signaled their interest in what Facebook has learned about Russia’s involvement in politically-tinged Facebook posts.</p> <p>A search warrant, however, would oblige Facebook to be responsive to Mueller in a way a voluntary request does not.</p> <p>“For Facebook, voluntarily turning over the information may not be the approach they want to take because their image is, ‘We trying to protect privacy of people’s information,'” Levenson said. “A subpoena could be used, but I think in this situation the message their trying to send to the Facebook customers is, ‘We follow the law, but we’re not voluntarily turning over your information.’”</p> <p>A question that has emerged since Facebook publicly admitted the presence of the accounts is whether the social media platform was the site of any criminal election law violations. Foreign nationals are prohibited from making political contributions — including money as well as other things “of value” — in U.S. elections. It is also illegal to aid and abet a foreign national’s contributions to a campaign.</p> <p>A question for Mueller’s team is who was behind the Facebook campaigns and whether the Facebook activity qualifies as a contribution “of value” under federal election law.</p> <p>Mueller also appears to be interested what sort of criteria was used by the ad purchasers in targeting the content, the Wall Street Journal reported. According to Rangappa, even some of the most sophisticated foreign intelligence operations may be unfamiliar with the nuances of American politics.</p> <p>“If the targeted criteria was so specific that they would really need someone who would know American culture and campaigns to help them, who would that person be? Who would have that knowledge?” Rangappa said.</p> <p>However, legal experts caution that a search warrant is by no means a predictor that the Mueller probe is heading towards an indictment.</p> <p>“It doesn’t meant that they have found evidence of crimes committed by Americans — it could be crimes committed by Russians—and it doesn’t mean that somebody may be charged with a crime,” Whiting said.</p> <p>“Some of these investigative moves, might be consequential and might be really leading to something, and some may be more crossing off less promising leads but making sure everything is chased down,” he added.</p></article>
	<article id="0001189" published-at="2017-10-08" title="Trump, Pence, the Flag and Everyone Gets Hurt"><p>It seems there’s no end to the public debate we can have about the relative weight of racism and authoritarianism that go into driving Donald Trump vs mere ego and narcissism, a grinding maw of appetite and self-gratification. Of course, we don’t really have to decide. It’s both. But today’s stunt does give us some reminder of the true pecking order.</p> <p>Mike Pence travelled to Indianapolis today to watch the Colts play the San Francisco 49ers with the pretty clear knowledge that at least some 49ers players would take a knee in silent protest during the national anthem. (The 49ers are Colin Kaepernick’s old team.) After some did, Pence made a great show of walking out on the game and <a href="https://twitter.com/VP/status/917074120084516865" type="external">tweeting out his outrage</a> at the players and commitment to the flag, America, the anthem, soldiers and unity.</p> <p>The Vice President’s press office followed up with this statement …</p> <q> <p>I left today’s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem. At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage, resolve, and resilience, now, more than ever, we should rally around our Flag and everything that unites us. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem. I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.</p> </q> <p>The pretty transparent upshot of all this was that the White House feels it needs to keep the ‘ungrateful black players won’t honor our flag or our military’ storyline going for yet another week. (Pence <a href="https://twitter.com/VaughnHillyard/status/917081486041468929" type="external">flew last night from Las Vegas to Indianapolis</a> for this and is about to fly back to California for a fundraiser, a whole almost cross country trip just to make this stunt possible.) It is conspicuous how Pence preaches the need for national unity while he and the White House continue transparently to exploit what they believe is the political value of heightening division.</p> <p>But even here, Trump <a type="internal">couldn’t help but jumping in to make clear that he told Pence to do this</a>, relishing stamping Pence as the toady he no doubt is.</p> <q> <p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">@VP</a> Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and <a href="https://twitter.com/SecondLady?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">@SecondLady</a> Karen.</p> <p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/917091286607433728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">October 8, 2017</a></p> </q> <p>If you were to plot it as story dialog it reads …</p> <p>Pence: I took this step based on my firm conviction …</p> <p>Trump: I told my boy Pence to do this.</p> <p>It’s such classic Trump it’s reminiscent of this iconic moment from the NATO summit.</p> <p>Admittedly, for Pence it serves as a minor cosmic justice. It reminds us what we already know. In Trumpland, everyone gets hurt. No one emerges with any dignity intact. He’s that ravening maw of ego and appetite and above all else unquenchable need and he has the country by the throat.</p></article>
	<article id="0001190" published-at="2017-09-23" title="Trump Unloads At Freewheeling Alabama Campaign Rally For ‘Big Luther’ Strange"><p>Ostensibly in Alabama to boost the campaign of Sen. Luther Strange, President Donald Trump held forth for over an hour at a Friday night rally on topics including North Korea’s nuclear program, health care, Hillary Clinton, and the National Football League, at one point even promising the crowd that he would campaign for Strange’s opponent if he lost the primary.</p> <p>“I told Luther if his opponent wins, I’ll be here campaigning like hell for him,” Trump told the Huntsville crowd, referring to former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore. He said Moore and Strange were “both good men.”</p> <p>The Cotton State’s GOP primary has <a type="internal">drawn national attention</a> because it pits two pro-Trump candidates, one establishment and one decidedly not, against each other. Sarah Palin and former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/22/alabama-senate-race-palin-and-gorka-rip-trump-backed-establishment-pick-rally-for-roy-moore.html" type="external">held a rally</a> this week for the ardently Christian firebrand Moore, who was suspended for refusing marriage license applications for same-sex couples. Trump, in a surprise move, aligned himself with Strange, the establishment favorite backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).</p> <p>At the Huntsville rally, Trump tried to shift this perception, insisting that Strange would not do McConnell’s bidding.</p> <p>“He doesn’t know Mitch McConnell at all. Luther is a tough cookie,” Trump said. “He doesn’t kowtow to anybody.”</p> <p>But the President didn’t exactly stay on-message, telling the audience that he was “taking a big risk” by involving himself in the primary because Strange, who has consistently trailed in the polls, could very well lose.</p> <p>“I shouldn’t be doing it—the last thing I want to do is be involved in a primary,” Trump said, adding, “I might have made a mistake.”</p> <p>Seconds later, though, he insisted Strange was “going to win easily” and could easily defeat a Democrat in the December general election.</p> <p>The six-foot-nine Strange, who Trump said he had taken to calling “Big Luther,” faces a difficult road to victory in Tuesday’s primary. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/09/23/i-love-alabama-its-special-at-rally-for-sen-luther-strange-trump-vents-frustrations-in-rambling-speech/" type="external">The Washington Post reported</a> that many supporters who packed the Von Braun Center were only there to see Trump and told the newspaper that they planned to vote for Moore.</p> <p>“I don’t know who this guy is,” one Afghanistan war veteran told the Post of Strange. “I’m here for Trump.”</p> <p>Those who showed up for a classic Trump rally got what they wanted.</p> <p>The President again weighed in on North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s efforts to build nuclear weapons, calling him “Little Rocket Man” and assuring the audience that he was “going to handle it.”</p> <p>He told the crowd, who broke into “Lock her up” chants when Trump mentioned Clinton’s name, to “speak to Jeff Sessions about that.”</p> <p>Invoking his signature border wall, Trump said that it “has to be see-through” so that no criminals in “wonderful, wonderful” Mexico hit anyone on the U.S. side in the head when they catapult “a hundred pounds of drugs” over it.</p> <p>And he spoke at length about NFL players protesting police brutality and racism by refusing to stand during the national anthem, calling it a “total disrespect of our heritage.”</p> <p>Team owners should respond to those players, Trump said, by saying, “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired. He’s fired!”</p> <p>“For a week, (that owner would) be the most popular person in this country,” the President continued, “because that’s a total disrespect of our heritage. That’s a total disrespect for everything we stand for.</p> <p>The crowd began trickling out early after Trump’s speech exceeded an hour, according to the Post. Strange, the candidate, had spoken for only four minutes.</p></article>
	<article id="0001191" published-at="2017-08-21" title="Peace Through Violence"><p>When a <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2017/08/13/James-Alex-Fields-Charlottesville-killing-driver-car-crowd-white-nationalist-rally/stories/201708130175" type="external">diagnosed schizophrenic</a> who’d been prescribed antipsychotic medicine plowed into a crowd of “peaceful protesters”—who were, in fact, illegally blocking a street—and killed a woman in Charlottesville, VA on August 13, the perpetually self-discrediting establishment media seized on this incident as proof that Donald Trump and all his supporters were murderously violent Nazis.</p> <p>Last week when Trump held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bhmYsYK7ow" type="external">press conference</a> and stated the truth—that there had been violence on “both sides” in Charlottesville—the ideology-blinded establishment press screamed bloody murder.</p> <p>When a female reporter asked him to denounce the Alt-Right, he <a href="http://www.apple.com" type="external">flipped the script</a>:</p> <q> <p>OK, what about the Alt-Left that came charging at—excuse me—what about the Alt-Left that came charging at the, as you say, the Alt-Right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?…What about the fact that they came charging—they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do….I think there’s blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it….you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats—you had a lot of bad people in the other group, too.</p> </q> <p>There was collective face-palming and head-shaking and finger-wagging and pearl-clutching and vapor-sniffing and diaper-shitting at his comments—not only among the resolutely leftist press, but among “conservative” placemats such as Mitt “The Loser” Romney and Little Marco Rubio. As is the wont of people who place their half-assed public moral posturing above the truth, no one bothered to factually refute what Trump said. Ideologues’ brains come Saran Wrapped with the presumption that they occupy the moral high ground; therefore, anything that contradicts their narrative is innately “evil” and cannot possibly be factual, so there is no sense in even attempting to argue facts.</p> <p>“Here’s the difference between words and violence: One involves words, the other involves violence. Glad I could clear that up.”</p> <p>Of course there was leftist violence in Charlottesville. For at least the past decade in America, there seems to be leftist violence wherever a non-leftist attempts to speak publicly. They <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyiZgG8eJ7w" type="external">burned</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmTfuyFlhoQ" type="external">smashed</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2qpQjoBKY8" type="external">assaulted</a> everything in their path at nearly every Trump campaign rally, while there was no hint of such right-wing behavior at Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton rallies.</p> <p>Based on the transparently fraudulent idea that publicly articulating any non-leftist ideas is equivalent to literal violence—or at least it will inevitably lead to violence if the speaker isn’t silenced and crushed—they justify all the cement-filled bottles and human feces they toss at all the imaginary “fascists” and “Nazis” they see wherever they turn. Their brains welded with endless propagandized horror about Hitler’s Six Million, they either don’t know or don’t care about Marx’s Hundred Million. This somehow allows them to see mere words as “violence” and their literal violence as mere “justice.” That’s how insanely and arrogantly hypocritical they are.</p> <p>Here’s the difference between words and violence: One involves words, the other involves violence. Glad I could clear that up.</p> <p><a href="https://t.co/vbKHQvsv8q" type="external">Watch this video</a> that shows stoic would-be “Unite the Right” rally attendees being taunted and heckled and poked from all sides as they try to safely get back to their vehicles and vamoose. Then try to tell me that the “Nazis” were the only aggressors.</p> <p>Look at <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2017/08/17/jake-tapper-antifa-protesters-attacked-several-journalists/" type="external">this footage</a> (halfway down the page) of a TV reporter getting clubbed in the head by an Antifa goon in Charlottesville and tell me the violence only came from one side. And listen to how Antifa attempts to justify sending the man to the hospital to get four staples in his head:</p> <q> <p>Due to the intensity and context of this time people are very scared of white men running full speed at them with iPhones as this is the exact behavior of a white supremacist trying to out identity of people of color and anti fascists in order to invoke fear…. He intentionally ignored the denial of consent, still without identifying himself (though we still wouldn’t care), which was a threat to safety and should be considered in a context of perpetuating rape culture.</p> </q> <p>As far as I can discern, the reporter was only trying to film the festivities. Being a reporter for a TV station anywhere in America in 2017, odds are that he leans left. But since Antifa didn’t like someone filming their animalistic behavior, he magically transformed into a “white supremacist” who endorsed “rape culture,” so there was nothing wrong with splitting his skull open.</p> <p>Beware of anyone who claims the moral high ground, because they will use their self-righteous delusions to justify the most depraved cruelties. In fact, fuck the idea of the “moral high ground” altogether. In historical practice, that’s nothing more than an illusion designed to make Church Ladies feel better about themselves. Seek the factual high ground. And the fact is, there was plenty of leftist violence in Charlottesville.</p> <p>Even worse than the leftist rioters’ self-justifications are the justifications of a resolutely ideological press that enables them to get away with violence. In a largely sympathetic profile of Antifa, CNN went Full Orwell with a headline that briefly included the phrase “ <a href="https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/898900890647752704/photo/1" type="external">peace through violence</a>.” (The headline was amended after someone apparently alerted CNN that it made them look insane.)</p> <p><a type="internal">Pay to Play - Put your money where your mouth is and subscribe for an ad-free experience and to join the world famous Takimag comment board.</a></p> <p>Check out the loving and reality-defying profile on <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/charlottesville-man-pictured-using-homemade-130131619.html" type="external">Yahoo!

One would think that would be a big story, no? But all this idiot reporter needed to hear was the phrase “white supremacists,” and he gullibly gulped down every word.</p> <p>Pavlov’s modern battalions of lapdogs are trained to bite at the mere hint of “white supremacists,” no matter how hyperbolic or flat-out inaccurate that term is.

The victims in this matter stated that they were traveling by boat in Bayou Chene when they were passing some guys in a boat who were hunting alligators. The victim stated that one of the guys from that boat shot a gun in their direction and continued towards St. Mary Parish. The victim stated that the suspect’s boat contained several alligators. There was a plastic gas can which was on top of the cabin of the commercial shrimp boat that was leaking gasoline from what appeared to be gunshot hole.</p> </q> <p>Chase Landry was later picked up in a traffic stop by St. Mary Parish patrol and taken to the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office, where he admitted to firing at the shrimp vessel.

I’m guessing if Chase has himself a creative Cajun lawyer, he could plead self defense in this one — and with the right local jury, he would most certainly be found not guilty. (For the record, I would still vote guilty — I was just exercising my regional Law &amp;amp; Order script-writing muscles.)</p></article>

	<article id="0001198" published-at="2016-07-01" title="EXCLUSIVE: Security Source Details Bill Clinton Maneuver to Meet Loretta Lynch"><p>Attorney General Loretta Lynch. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p> <p>Attorney General Loretta Lynch. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p> <p>An exclusive interview with a security source who was present at the unplanned meeting Monday night on a Phoenix tarmac between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lorretta Lynch has shed additional light on an unusual summit that is embroiling the AG in charges of favoritism. As attorney general, Lynch heads the Department of Justice just as it is deciding whether to proceed with charges against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server during her tenure as President Obama’s secretary of state.</p> <p>The source has decades of experience providing security to government officials. The source spoke to the Observer for 20 minutes and answered follow-up questions via text message on the condition that no further details be revealed, including even gender, given the possibility of losing his or her job as an active overseer of security arrangements. This person was on-hand for the entirety of the meeting and some of its aftermath.</p> <p>According to this source, whose credentials were checked and confirmed by the Observer with sources inside both the FBI and the United States Secret Service, the attorney general was caught completely off guard by the meeting and the source dismisses suggestions that have been raised alleging that she waited there to see Bill Clinton or accommodated his request to see him. In fact, it seems from this source that it was Bill Clinton who was maneuvering for face time with the attorney general, because his plane had been scheduled to leave before hers arrived.</p> <p>“Fair is fair. I’m a conservative-leaning [person] [gender-identifying word redacted]. I don’t support anything this administration does. I don’t know much about the attorney general’s past, except she has a good reputation. But I really don’t like this executive’s office, so that said, politically, that’s where I’m at. But I just happened to be in a position to know firsthand what went down that day.”</p> <p>The FBI protects the attorney general and the Secret Service protects POTUS and there are elements from that agency that protect former presidents. According to the source, “The AG and the director each have a protective detail because they travel extensively and that duty falls to the FBI. They have a formalized unit, a detail, that lives and works out of Washington, D.C. Then there will be FBI leaders who are experts in other towns and regions who coordinate visits—someone in Chicago FBI will coordinate with the D.C. detail when the director or the AG comes to Chicago. So what happened here is that the FBI agents in Phoenix were in touch with the detail leaders in D.C. for the AG’s visit. Somebody from D.C. will advance the trip and liaise with the local element, who has a big SWAT team and provide everything they need so they can send only a skeletal unit with her, two people—a medic and protection. They don’t need to commit 27 people. Details include surveilling all the locations, the routes, the hospitals, safe zones; that’s all handled by [the local FBI people] [actual words redacted to avoid identifying source].”</p> <p>According to the source, the FBI agents protecting Lynch “knew former POTUS was in town and another executive was coming and knew Lynch was coming so we knew there’d be congestion. We were waiting for her plane to touch down at the executive terminal area of Phoenix’s Sky Harbor where it’s best suited to control. Clinton’s plane was on the ground already. But he wasn’t there. We had been hoping to get him out before she arrived, just to avoid too much traffic. They [their planes] were 75 yards apart. We have a procedure we do to clear [space for] a motorcade. As we were ready to receive her, I saw the other motorcade coming in—we were like, ‘great timing.’ ”</p> <p>The source was being sarcastic in saying “great timing,” indicating that it would have been better logistically for Clinton’s plane to take off before Lynch’s arrived, to avoid the congestion of two motorcades on the tarmac at once. The source indicated that Clinton’s people at the airport didn’t know what was taking Clinton’s motorcade so long to arrive and speculated that the delay was engineered specifically so that Clinton would not have left before Lynch arrived.</p> <p>“Then I see Clinton walking over. His detail guys ran over to hers and said he’s coming. ‘He’s closing.’ He walked straight there to the Air Force guy at the door and next thing I know he’s going up the steps [of her plane].” Asked about the Air Force detail, the source later clarified to the Observer that “There was an Air Force airman at the base of the stairs of the [Lynch] aircraft, as you always see on TV with POTUS.”</p> <p>According to the source, “Nobody knew this was coming. We just knew to be aware there were other events going on. There was no planned meeting. It was just chance contact. The fact is, he just started walking over. I don’t think it was pre-arranged. He just started walking over and [even her security] can’t tell him, ‘you can’t do that.’ He walked in her plane for at least 20 to 25 minutes and the FBI is standing face to face with the Secret Service and just chatting on the hot tarmac like, ‘what the hell.’ ”</p> <p>Regarding the reaction and its aftermath, the source told the Observer, “I didn’t think of the political ramifications, just the timing, ’cause we had other things to do. He [Clinton] came off and shook the hands of the heads of Lynch’s detail. Then her detail finally got her off the plane, now much delayed, and departed for her day’s events. She had a series of visits planned for Tuesday.”</p> <p>The source said that the impromptu visit made an immediate impression upon Lynch’s staff (meaning her non-security personnel).</p> <p>“I don’t agree with her politics and all that, but I knew from the beginning that she got caught off guard and her staff was already talking about it that it’s going to be a political problem for her. Her staff was flipping out. We didn’t think about the political part until we saw her staff flipping out. For the security guys, it was more of a ‘I’ve got armed guys coming into my perimeter’ problem. But the staff guys saw right away that it was a political problem. After Clinton got off, they were like, ‘that wasn’t good.’ And I know from others who were in the actual car with her that her people knew immediately the political ramifications of it and were very upset.”</p> <p>The meeting has indeed turned into a political firestorm for the attorney general, with President Obama’s press secretary, Josh Earnest, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/us/politics/meeting-between-bill-clinton-and-loretta-lynch-provokes-political-furor.html" type="external">declining to say</a> whether the interaction between the powerful husband of a person being investigated and the attorney general was appropriate.

I still remember a time when I genuinely thought something along the lines of, “Fox News is right-wing, CNN is neutral and everything else is center-left.” I know, I was an idiot. But the last election really helped me pay attention and it was easily revealed to me what these news outlets really are – propaganda machines for the Democrat Party and progressive politics. With all the hysteria surrounding The Donald, it was as if the veneer of legitimacy was sandblasted off the maggot-infested wood of the house the mainstream media had built.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>I still remember Donald Trump calling out these cretins.</p> <p>But now, Americans are fighting back. There is a new movement to fight against these companies by cutting them off at the source. Millions of Americans are cutting their cable and satellite subscriptions as a form of boycotting these slugs. Just look at the whole <a type="internal">Harvey Weinstein situation.</a> Are you really going to tell me you didn’t think this kind of thing wasn’t rampant in Hollywood and media types?</p> <p>This is from a Bloomberg article:</p> <q> <p>“Investors in traditional TV providers are reeling as companies from AT&amp;amp;T Inc. to Viacom Inc. fail to stop the desertion of customers lured away by cheaper entertainment options such as Netflix and Snapchat.</p> <p>AT&amp;amp;T, whose ownership of the DirecTV satellite service makes it the biggest U.S. pay-television provider, said late Wednesday it will report a third-quarter loss of 390,000 satellite and cable customers, echoing a similar warning weeks earlier from Comcast Corp. The same night, Viacom cautioned that its distribution deal with Charter Communications Inc., the second-biggest cable U.S. company, may lead to a blackout, potentially testing whether millions of viewers are willing to go without MTV and Nickelodeon.”</p> </q> <p>These companies are being cut off at the knees. There is nothing that would make me more proud to be an American than to see these companies starved of revenue and ultimately destroyed. All they have done is brainwash us and our children, to be constantly outraged, violent arms for the progressive agenda.</p> <p>From Deadline:</p> <q> <p>“As reported in August, Disney has been eyeing ways to cut up to 10% in annual costs at its Disney/ABC Television Group in a restructuring. Along with the reductions, as part of a realignment at the company to address big shifts in content distribution and other technology-related areas of the business, there will be some hiring opportunities across the company going forward.”</p> </q> <p>As long as you pay for your giant TV subscriptions, you are subsidizing these companies.

	<article id="0001209" published-at="2016-10-10" title="Donald Trump misses the point on ISIS and Islam">
© Getty Images <p>During Sunday’s presidential debate, an audience member asked the 2016 candidates a question about Islamophobia. In response, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stressed the importance of recognizing and solving radical Islamic terrorism. To do this, Trump explained, “We have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.”</p> <p>Democratic candidate <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> responded by calling his earlier position and rhetoric of banning Muslims “shortsighted” and “dangerous.” Clinton explained that, “What Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.” And she is right. Ostracizing the Muslim community is fodder for ISIS propaganda.</p> <p>The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) operates under the veneer of religion. Although their propaganda perpetuates the falsehood that they are killing in the name of Allah, the reality is that most ISIS fighters are being exploited for the benefit of war profiteers and Godless opportunists. Islamic theologians around the world agree that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/us/isis-threatens-muslim-preachers-who-are-waging-theological-battle-online.html?_r=0" type="external">ISIS leadership manipulates the interpretation of the Quran</a> to fit its personal agenda and then disseminates this message through clever propaganda, charismatic speeches and intensive instruction/brainwashing. Targeting Muslims for the actions of ISIS fosters the perceived religious connection between ISIS and Islam, promoting their primary source of manipulated legitimacy.</p> <p>Moreover, targeting people on the basis of Islamic religion is not an effective exercise for counterterrorism, considering that (1) ISIS is active in recruiting non-Muslim converts and (2) the vast majority of true Muslims are familiar enough with their religion to completely dismiss ISIS' manipulated interpretation of the Quran. In order to effectively combat ISIS and protect the world from their continued wrath, it is important for the presidential hopefuls to understand who exactly is being recruited into terrorism.</p> <p>Prior to being conscripted, prospective extremists often aren't particularly religious and typically live on the margins of society. Recruiters target people who are in need to become their martyrs, and engage these prospects by temporarily filling — or simply making the false promise to fulfill — the needs in their life. For citizens of countries like Syria, Iraq and Tunisia, this means offering basic physiological sustenance to support their families: employment, food, money and/or safety from their wrath. For citizens of industrialized countries, like France, the United States, Canada and Australia, this means offering prospective recruits a sense of <a href="https://behavioralpolicy.org/article/belonging-nowhere-marginalization-radicalization-risk-among-muslim-immigrants/" type="external">belonging</a>, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/jihad-jane-colleen-larose-became-terrorist-love-n284636" type="external">“love,”</a> esteem and/or self-actualization.</p> <p>Following the debate, many Muslim viewers on social media expressed that they felt Trump’s response was Islamophobic. Rhetoric that alienates the Muslim community for the actions of ISIS helps further the fabricated religious connection that fuels their perceived legitimacy. Moreover, denying refugee status for people trying to escape the Islamic State will also increase the sampling pool for ISIS recruiters. While the safety of Americans should be paramount to any commander in chief, the fact of the matter is that the current refugee vetting system is incredibly thorough. According to a report from the <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/syrian-refugees-dont-pose-serious-security-threat" type="external">CATO Institute</a>, "Of the 859,629 refugees who have entered the United States since 2001, three have been convicted for planning a terrorist attack abroad and exactly zero have perpetrated domestic attacks.”</p> <p>Given these statistics and the humanitarian crisis in Syria, some would say that the United States has a moral obligation to take in more Syrian refugees. However, this cannot be done in a vacuum. Refugees in the United States often settle in lower socioeconomic areas. This puts them at continued risk of becoming the victims of crime and/or recruitment targets of organized crime groups. In order to responsibly accept refugees, America must continue vetting them thoroughly and provide adequate social and security support upon arrival and thereafter.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is extremely difficult for a Syrian to become a refugee in the United States. According to the CATO Institute, there is a 0.042 percent chance of a Syrian refugee entering the United States after spending at least three years in a refugee camp. It is easier for ISIS to secure student visas, tourist visas and business visas, or to simply recruit lawful permanent residents or citizens in the United States. Although we may not know exactly who we are admitting in the short term, the risk is extremely low, and denying admission to refugees is much more dangerous — for them and us — in the long term.</p> <p>Mehlman-Orozco holds a Ph.D. in criminology, law and society from George Mason University, with an expertise in human trafficking.

© Getty Images <p>As another terror attack struck the homeland, this time returning to New York City, local politicians rushed to calm fears by parsing over whether it was an act of international terror or a “lone-wolf attack,” as if that matters.</p> <p>In short order the FBI announced that an arrest has been made, which signaled to someone like me in law enforcement that we would learn the suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami was previously known to the FBI. He was.</p> <p>We’re told that no probable cause existed to arrest Rahami before he attacked. We have seen this response over and over again. Although true, that statement also reveals a deeper, systemic problem.</p> <p>ISIS has declared war on America. We need to use a war model to prosecute this campaign and instead we are using a law-enforcement model which seeks probable cause to arrest, a very high standard often times not achievable until after an attack (crime) occurs and then enough evidence that will stand up in a court of law. The actors, whether part of an international organization or radicalized American citizens, are enemy combatants, not common criminals.</p> <p>As soon as the planning stage begins they should be picked up and held indefinitely, preferably at Gitmo.As a law-enforcement leader who deals with domestic terrorism and attacks on our population on the front lines, it is imperative that I relay one crucial bit of intelligence from my end: we are not structured properly and thus unable to defend the homeland adequately until our domestic intelligence apparatus changes drastically.</p> <p>The mission of a true intelligence agency is to disrupt, prevent and detect terror attacks before they occur. An arrest is not necessarily the goal. Informing decision-makers in enough time to act is the goal.</p> <p>I have been sounding the alarm about this for the past several years, but it is up to Americans to demand a change from their government. Our lives continue to be lost, people maimed, and populations increasingly terrorized, for the simple reason that we have put the wrong organization with the wrong mission in charge: the FBI.</p> <p>President Obama declared this great work even though 29 people were injured and a million others psychologically damaged. It was an intelligence failure.</p> <p>Americans respect their law enforcement and their government, but there comes a point when we have to ask for some accountability from those tasked with this job.</p> <p>Right now, the FBI is the lead domestic security agency. As in nearly every other attack they looked, found no probable cause to arrest and turned away.</p> <p>Continuing to ask the FBI to handle domestic security is wrongheaded and dangerous for one simple reason: the FBI is structured to investigate law violations, not produce intelligence. The FBI reports directly to the Department of Justice Attorney General—a highly politicized entity—and must establish the high standard of “probable cause” as part of their investigative approach to domestic security.</p> <p>If there’s no viable case early on, as DOJ officials instruct, the scrutiny of a potential terrorist becomes a matter of wasted resources. Dangerous men and women fall off watch-lists and more Americans live in fear waiting for the next attack.</p> <p>In the wake of recent attacks on American soil, from Orlando to San Bernardino and now Minnesota and New York City, it is clearer than ever that the FBI’s law-enforcement approach is unable to disrupt enough fatal and dangerous attacks against our domestic targets before they happen.</p> <p>President Obama has offered a solution: the pathetic, weak, and un-American, “learn to live with it.”</p> <p>That kind of capitulation to hate and murderers is not acceptable to me, nor should it be to any American. We don’t give up or change our way of life like at airports simply to protect a bureaucratic system that is failing, or because we are afraid of truly taking on an enemy intent on destroying Western culture.</p> <p>We require the proper organization and organizing mission that focuses instead on identifying potential threats, establishing what capabilities they have, determining if an attack is being planned, and alerting decision-makers.</p> <p>This organization does not exist here as of yet, but it needs to, and quick. A new entity focused on protection, not prosecution, is the only way to protect Americans.</p> <p>We live in a new era; like it or not, the enemy is at war with us, and they’ve come to our home soil. This isn’t the time to plant rose bushes and go about our daily lives, it’s time to assess, adjust our protocol, and stand up for American lives.</p> <p>President Obama isn’t doing it. The media isn’t able to even articulate what this war is about. It’s up to the American people to demand that a new domestic security entity take up the protection of the homeland.</p> <p>The views expressed by Contributors are their own and are not the views of The Hill.</p></article>
	<article id="0001211" published-at="2016-08-01" title="Brent Budowsky: McCain, VFW shame Trump on Gold Star family">
© Getty Images <p>Every day the evidence mounts that Donald Trump, the presidential candidate favored by Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, is temperamentally, intellectually and morally unfit to be commander in chief of the American military.</p> <p>The latest example of Trump’s disastrous ignorance and ideas about national security is his insulting treatment of the Gold Star mom and dad of the intensely patriotic and heroic Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in action saving the lives of others who were risking their lives to defend our country alongside him.</p> <p>Today Sen. <a type="internal">John McCain</a> (R-Ariz.) added his powerful and nationally respected voice to the chorus of condemnation that Trump is receiving from leading veterans groups, who are expressing outrage and indignation against the billionaire’s insults of Khizr Khan, the fallen hero’s Gold Star father, and Ghazala Khan, his Gold Star mother.</p> <p>In a deeply patriotic and passionate 697-word statement, McCain discussed at length his family tradition of military service and his outrage against the insults Trump directed against Khan’s mother and father. He also correctly noted that Trump’s extreme position against immigration of Muslims into America would have prevented Muslim-American heroes such as Khan from coming to America, serving our country and saving countless lives.</p> <p>And I would add that many military and intelligence leaders, including David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director, have condemned Trump’s ideas against Muslims as providing aid, comfort and support to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and other terror groups that seek to attack America.</p> <p>Also today the Veterans of Foreign Wars, one of America’s largest and leading veterans organizations, which represents those who wore the uniform over many generations, added its national voice to the condemnation of Trump’s insults against the Gold Star mother and father of Capt. Khan.</p> <p>McCain, the VFW, veterans groups and patriotic Americans of all persuasions treat respect of Gold Star mothers as a sacred trust, which Trump violated — just the latest example in the litany of insults that he has directed against one group of Americans after another.</p> <p>McCain continues to reluctantly support Trump and the future will tell if his support will continue; as the VFW’s statement notes, our respect and admiration for Gold Star mothers and fathers transcends all partisan and electoral considerations.</p> <p>I do not support Trump. In fact I believe his insults against the Khans is only the latest example of why I and many others believe that Trump as commander in chief would be a major national risk to America’s national security and those who serve to protect and defend it.</p> <p>Over the weekend the GOP’s nominee stated that Russia has not intervened in Ukraine, a false and ignorant statement that is universally known to be incorrect.</p> <p>Not long ago he told The New York Times, doubling down on this statement since, that if Russia invaded Europe he would not come to Europe’s defense if he believed that European nations did not meet his standards of defense spending. It is unprecedented for any American president since the creation of NATO, Democratic or Republican, and for any leader of any European democracy, conservative or liberal, to state that the United States might not defend Europe from a Russian invasion and an attempt to establish a Russian dictatorship over any nation that belongs to NATO.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly stated that he would order American troops to commit acts of torture if he is elected, which some leading retired military commanders have already stated they would refuse to obey because it would constitute an international war crime and make American prisoners of war vulnerable to torture from our enemies.</p> <p>Leading intelligence professionals now believe that Russia has embarked on an aggressive campaign of espionage and cyber warfare and information warfare against America designed to attack <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> and elect the candidate they favor: Donald Trump.</p> <p>Make no mistake. In the most important sense Russia is waging an undeclared war against America, conducted not with troops and bombs but with cyber warfare, to hack our systems and information warfare to leak information received through espionage, to help Trump, and to defeat Clinton, at crucial moments such as the Democratic National Convention.</p> <p>After the Russian espionage was revealed, Trump took the inexcusable action of publicly supporting and encouraging this Russian cyber invasion of America, in this Russian attempt to help Trump become commander in chief. Trump repeated this view a number of times, and tried to retreat by laughably pretending it was just a bad joke.</p> <p>Regarding this latest Trump insult against the Khans, the loud and rising chorus of condemnation may well force Trump to retract his comments. But whether or not this happens, what Trump said attacking and insulting a Gold Star mother and Gold Star father is one more example of why America should never allow his finger to be on the nuclear war button, and why voters should never allow a man with his temperament and vices to be commander in chief.</p> <p>Budowsky was an aide to former Sen.

	<article id="0001212" published-at="2015-12-01" title="Dick Morris: Why Obama spared ISIS oil">
© Getty Images <p>Last week, on the “Charlie Rose” show, former Obama CIA Director <a type="internal">Mike Morell</a> dropped a bombshell that was little noticed by the media. He said that the reason <a type="internal">President Obama</a> did not bomb the oil fields now controlled by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was that he did not want to cause environmental damage.</p> <p>Morell said that “we didn’t go after oil wells, actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls, because we didn’t want to do environmental damage and we didn’t want to destroy that infrastructure.”</p> <p>If ever a statement by a former administration official offered a glimpse into the looney priorities of the Obama administration, this is it! We did not bomb the oil fields upon which ISIS depends for the bulk of its revenue because of our concerns about adding to the carbon emissions that promote global warming (in the desert).</p> <p>So we let ISIS rake in millions of dollars every day, selling about 100,000 barrels of oil at an average of about $20/barrel (discounted) for a take of $2 million every day. ISIS may be led by radical, crazy jihadists, but the rank and file of the ISIS military is reported to be paid soldiers fighting for money. Cut off the money and you cut off the army.</p> <p>But Obama put the minor, incremental damage of destroying the oil fields ahead of the need to stop ISIS from rampaging through the Western world, killing people at random. He apparently worried that the effects of destroying the oil wells could be severe.</p> <p>This kind of environmental fantasizing was in vogue during the Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein’s destruction of all of Kuwait’s oil fields was thought to be likely to cause huge damage. Paul Crutzen, a noted atmospheric scientist, predicted that a “nuclear winter” might ensue with a cloud of smoke covering half the Northern Hemisphere for at least 100 days. Carl Sagan argued that the effects of the destruction of Kuwaiti oil fields could be comparable to the explosion of the volcano Tambora in 1815, which produced “a year without summer.”</p> <p>It never happened.</p> <p>Scientist Patrick K. Dowling wrote, in his study “The Meteorological Effects of the Kuwaiti Oil Fires,” that the smoke only affected the weather pattern throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991. A 1992 study found that emissions of carbon dioxide were only 2 percent of global emissions. Big deal.</p> <p>Remember that Kuwait produced about 2 million barrels per day before the Gulf War — at least 10 times as much as the ISIS oil wells generate. The Kuwaiti fires dwarf anything destroying the ISIS oil wells would produce when it comes to any harmful environmental effects.</p> <p>Why isn’t Obama using our air power to attack tankers carrying ISIS oil to refineries in Turkey? Again, we wanted to fight the world’s first green war. As Morell put it, “There seemed to have been a judgment that, look, we don’t want to destroy these oil tankers because that’s infrastructure that’s going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn’t there anymore and it’s going to create environmental damage.”</p> <p>Once again, Obama wants to fight terrorism, but everything else comes first.</p> <p>Morell noted that the administration didn’t even want to hit oil trucks carrying fuel from ISIS oil fields.</p> <p>To enter the mind of Barack Obama and see the low priority he accords fighting terrorism is to see a nightmare unfolding. How can we trust him to keep us safe and to keep out ISIS terrorists who have so thoroughly infiltrated the ranks of Syrian refugees?</p> <p>With Obama, protecting Americans from terror comes in last in his list of priorities.</p> <p>Morris, who served as adviser to former Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and former President Clinton, is the author of 17 books, including his latest, “Power Grab: Obama’s Dangerous Plan for a One Party Nation” and “Here Come the Black Helicopters.” To get all of his and Eileen McGann’s columns for free by email, go to dickmorris.com.</p></article>
	<article id="0001213" published-at="2016-08-29" title="Juan Williams: Trump's race politics will destroy GOP">
© Getty Images <p>Now for some startling opinions about race relations and the current leader of the Republican Party, Donald Trump.</p> <p>In the opinion of 50 percent of all Americans, the word 'racist' fits Trump either "very well" or "somewhat well," according to a July poll from the Associated Press and GfK. Most of those people — 35 percent of the overall population — said the term fits the GOP nominee "very well."</p> <p>Here’s another eye-opening opinion: Most Americans, 56 percent, “believe that Trump is biased against women and minorities,” according to an August Washington Post poll.</p> <p>Last week, Democratic presidential nominee <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> said Trump is “taking hate groups mainstream,” and “helping a radical fringe take over one of America’s two major political parties.” Trump tried to reduce the accusations to a game of tit-for-tat by calling her a "bigot.”</p> <p>But Clinton’s words simply amplified what Speaker <a type="internal">Paul Ryan</a> (R-Wis.) said months ago, after Trump attacked an Indiana-born judge as being incapable of fairness because of his Mexican heritage. Ryan said Trump’s remarks amounted to a “textbook definition of a racist comment.”</p> <p>The damage Trump is doing to the GOP is evident in polls showing more than 12 percent of registered Republicans intend to vote for Clinton. GOP-leaning independent voters are staying away from Trump, too. The latest Quinnipiac poll had Clinton with 51 percent support and the Republican nominee fading.</p> <p>As a result, the GOP is now likely to lose control of the Senate and lose seats in the House in the fall election.</p> <p>And yet Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader <a type="internal">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-Ky.) and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus have decided they have to stand with Trump — even as he destroys their party.</p> <p>Much of the damage is directly tied to Trump’s racial politics.</p> <p>Long before Trump, the GOP already had few black and Latino elected officials. The party is in desperate need of more women as well as racial and ethnic diversity to keep up with the reality of the nation’s changing demographics.</p> <p>A wider range of people backing conservative principles — from small government and low taxes, to free trade and policies supporting strong families — is not tokenism. It is a necessity if the party is to remain relevant to policy debates and have any chance of winning in the future.</p> <p>And there are churchgoing, family loving black people, Latinos and immigrants who share those values but see the GOP as an exclusively white party.</p> <p>The potential power of a racially diverse GOP was on display this year in the ongoing controversy over police use of excessive force against blacks. The debate was an exercise in polarization between Republican law-and-order voices backing the police and Democrats backing the controversial Black Lives Matter group when Sen. <a type="internal">Tim Scott</a> (R-S.C.) stood up.</p> <p>Even in a business suit and wearing a lapel pin signifying that he is a member of the Senate, Scott recalled being treated like a criminal suspect by Capitol Police: “The officer looked at me, full of attitude… I was thinking to myself, either he thinks I’m committing a crime — impersonating a member of Congress — or what?”</p> <p>As a black man, a conservative and a Republican senator, Scott said he has “felt the anger…that comes with feeling like you are being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.”</p> <p>And when the Ku Klux Klan’s former Grand Wizard endorsed Trump by saying it is “treason” against white heritage to fail to vote for Trump, Scott again spoke up:</p> <p>“Any candidate who cannot immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party,” he said. “If Donald Trump can’t take a stand against the KKK, we cannot trust him to stand up for America against Putin, Iran or ISIS.”</p> <p>Scott’s stand against Trump now can be seen as an early storm warning. As Labor Day approaches, the awful reality of what Trump has done to the GOP goes beyond polls showing Trump is on track to lose more than 90 percent of the black vote and around 80 percent of the Latino vote.</p> <p>The real issue for the GOP is that the latest polls have him losing white women with college degrees. That is devastating to the Republican brand.</p> <p>Trump’s recent speeches about black America to overwhelmingly white audiences — asking black people “what the hell do you have to lose?” by voting for him — is an effort to regain the support of white Republicans who do not want to vote for someone viewed as a bigot.</p> <p>Trump established himself in national Republican politics five years ago by pushing the racist conspiracy theory that President Obama was not an American citizen. Trump’s shameful stoking of this effort to undermine the credibility of the first black president remains an issue.</p> <p>A disturbing poll from NBC News/Survey Monkey taken earlier this month found that a shockingly low 25 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement “ <a type="internal">Barack Obama</a> was born in the U.S.”</p> <p>The GOP’s problem with black voters didn’t begin when Barack Obama became president and it won’t end when he leaves the White House.</p> <p>Even as he swept 49 states in his 1984 reelection, Ronald Reagan only won 9 percent of the black vote. George W. Bush fared only slightly better in his 2004 re-election, netting 11 percent of the black vote but put blacks in his cabinet, notably Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice.</p> <p>Ryan, to his credit, has tried to follow in the footsteps of his mentor, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who famously toured black communities promoting economic growth with “empowerment zones.”</p> <p>Trump is squandering those decades of efforts on race by Republicans.</p> <p>Ryan, McConnell and Priebus need to dump Trump and save their party.</p> <p>Juan Williams is an author and political analyst for Fox News Channel.

	<article id="0001214" published-at="2016-09-19" title="Juan Williams: Clinton spoke the truth on 'deplorables'"><p>She called out the haters, the bigots and the racists as a “basket of deplorables.”</p> <p>David Axelrod, President Obama’s former top political guru, called Clinton’s words a “mistake” that might allow Republican nominee Donald Trump to “seize the high ground.”</p> <p>The New York Times’ liberal editorial page similarly concluded “real damage had been done” because Clinton had written off a group of voters by saying they were “irredeemable.”</p> <p>Sally Kohn, the left-leaning CNN commentator, wrote in The Washington Post that “what is, in fact, deplorable is not only that Clinton said this but that she apparently believes it.”</p> <p>Kohn explained that while Trump is clearly “running a xenophobic campaign that’s pandering to white nationalism,” most of his supporters are filled with “resentment that is partly about identity but also about economic suffering.” Clinton, Kohn argued, “should be reaching out to these voters, not offending them.”</p> <p>This line of thinking from influential white Democrats reminded me of a line in President Reagan’s 1989 farewell address: “Don’t be afraid to see what you see.”</p> <p>And here is what I see:</p> <p><a type="internal">Mike Pence</a>, Trump’s vice presidential running mate, was asked a few days after Clinton’s speech if he would call former Ku Klux Klan leader and white supremacist David Duke a "deplorable."</p> <p>"No, I'm not in the name-calling business,” Pence responded, refusing to condemn an indisputable racist and Trump supporter.</p> <p>Instead, Pence complained: "What Hillary Clinton did Friday night was shocking. I mean, the millions of people who support Donald Trump around this country are not a basket of anything."</p> <p>And then I saw Trump’s son, Donald Jr., post an image of his dad, Pence and Alex Jones.</p> <p>Jones is best known for advancing the conspiracy theory that the U.S. government was behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed almost 3,000 people. Jones has also suggested the government is putting chemical additives into juice boxes, intending to make children homosexual to control population growth. And Jones claims the massacre of school children at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 was staged as part of a government plot to enact gun control and that no children were actually killed there.</p> <p>Trump has praised Jones for “his amazing reputation” and appeared as a guest on his show during the GOP primaries.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Trump Jr. tweeted an article from Jones’ website which stated that Hillary Clinton was wearing an earpiece during a forum with Matt Lauer on NBC News. Clinton was not wearing an earpiece, of course.</p> <p>At a Trump rally last week in Asheville, N.C., a 69-year-old woman protesting against the GOP nominee at one of the candidate’s rallies was punched in the face by a Trump supporter. She later called a North Carolina television station to ask if people found a Trump supporter punching her in the face ‘deplorable’?</p> <p>So, I see a lot of deplorable behavior. But some political thought-leaders — including some Clinton supporters — prefer to excuse it as the actions of a few misguided people and not representative of most Trump supporters.</p> <p>Can we determine if close to half of Trump supporters hold deplorable beliefs? Let’s go to the polls.</p> <p>An April poll taken by Reuters found that a large percentage of self-described Trump supporters describe black people as more “lazy” than whites (40 percent), “less intelligent” than whites (32 percent), more “rude” than whites (44 percent), more “violent” than whites (48 percent) and more “criminal” than whites (46 percent).</p> <p>Another Reuters poll taken in July found that 58 percent of Trump supporters have either a “very unfavorable” or “somewhat unfavorable” view of the entire religion of Islam.</p> <p>These are racist views. If they do not count as “deplorable,” then the word “deplorable” no longer has any meaning. By the way, a Washington Post/ABC News poll has 60 percent of Americans agreeing that Trump is personally “biased against women and minorities.”</p> <p>Another shocking poll from NBC News/Survey Monkey taken in August found that just 27 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement “ <a type="internal">Barack Obama</a> was born in the U.S.”</p> <p>Trump burst on to the national political stage five years ago as the “birther-in-chief,” perpetuating this overtly racist conspiracy theory about the first black President of the United States. Only last week did he finally — and briefly — acknowledge that Obama was born in the United States.</p> <p>As she prepares for her first debate with Trump next week, Clinton needs to unapologetically remind voters — especially traditional Republicans who are uncomfortable with seeing their party overrun by extremists — of the racist, paranoid fringes that Trump has invited into the nation’s politics under the banner of the Republican Party.</p> <p>Clinton laid the groundwork in a speech in Nevada last month when she declared that "a fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party."</p> <p>She accused Trump of “disregard for the values that make our country."</p> <p>After being scolded for her ‘deplorables’ comment, Clinton backtracked. She explained that she was being “grossly generalistic…I regret saying ‘half’ – that was wrong.”</p> <p>Clinton should not have apologized. Calling out the bullies and the bigots in a national presidential election is brave. Listen to her running mate, Sen. <a type="internal">Tim Kaine</a> (D-Va.).</p> <p>“She advanced the notion that if you’re chumming around with the head of the KKK … that’s deplorable,” Kaine said. “You’ve got to call that out. If you’re attacking immigrants, that’s deplorable. If you’re attacking LGBT Americans, that’s deplorable. If you’re attacking people because they’re Muslims, that’s deplorable.”</p> <p>To quote President Reagan once again: “Don’t be afraid to see what you see.”</p> <p>Juan Williams is an author and political analyst for Fox News Channel.

	<article id="0001215" published-at="2015-09-15" title="Markos Moulitsas: The real terrorist threat">
© Getty Images <p>It’s tough being a conservative these days.</p> <p>After attacking President Obama as “weak on terrorism” for nearly seven years, the nation hasn’t suffered a single terrorist attack even remotely like the 9/11 terrorist attack during George W. Bush’s presidency or the Beirut barracks bombings during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. As much as conservatives claim that Democratic policies harm the nation, it’s Republican administrations that have had the weakest record when it comes to keeping our nation safe.</p> <p>In fact, one could argue that conservative policies are a root cause of terrorism, whether it is encouraging a foreign policy that breeds new terrorists overseas or cheering on the kind of lax gun laws and racist xenophobia that enable domestic terrorists such as Dylann Roof in South Carolina. After all, it’s no accident that Donald Trump inspired two Boston brothers into beating a Latino homeless man senseless.</p> <p>Violent right-wingers certainly don’t lack passion. In a study by the United States Military Academy, American Muslims accounted for 20 successful plots since 9/11, leading to 50 fatalities. In contrast, right-wing extremists averaged 337 attacks per year, killing 254 people. And those numbers have only increased since the study was published in 2012. Meanwhile, the government’s ability to monitor and thwart such attacks was crippled by conservative anger over the 2009 Department of Homeland Security report detailing the danger from this violent fringe.</p> <p>And then there’s terrorism enabled by our nation’s lax gun laws. According to the Mass Shooting Tracker, there have already been 273 shootings in which more than three people were wounded or killed people this year, killing a total of 346 and wounding 1,004. But like right-wing violence, conservatives don’t consider this epidemic “terrorism,” proving their definition is conveniently narrow enough to exclude any violence that doesn’t justify their next war.</p> <p>With the dearth of successful Islamist attacks on this country, it’s only mildly surprising that a conservative like 20-year-old Joshua Goldberg would try to spark things into action.</p> <p>Goldberg worked closely with conservative news outlet Breitbart on efforts to discredit the Black Lives Matter movement, tried tirelessly to smear human rights groups including the Human Rights Law Center and Amnesty International, and was an avid participant in the “Gamergate” movement, a misogynist effort to drive out feminists from the video game industry. And last week, Goldberg was arrested for conspiring with a supposed agent of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to bomb a 9/11 vigil service in Kansas City, Mo.</p> <p>According to the indictment, Goldberg didn’t just advise the would-be terrorist on how to build a bomb, he also advised him to dip the shrapnel in rat poison so that victims’ wounds wouldn’t clot, thus increasing their chances of bleeding to death.</p> <p>It seems incredible that right-wing conservatives would go to such great lengths to harm fellow Americans, but there is a palpable sense of desperation among the radicalized fringe as American culture leaves them behind. They have spent years claiming that Obama’s every step will lead to a loss of “freedom” and the Islamization of this country, yet Americans now widely embrace marriage equality, racial and religious tolerance, and even ObamaCare. The nation’s deficit is down, the economy and job picture are improving, healthcare costs are contained, and <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> still enjoys dominant leads in general election polls. And there’s no Sharia law anywhere to be found.</p> <p>So when reality doesn’t confirm your crazy ideology, why not give it a little helpful push? Luckily, Goldberg was caught in time. Hopefully, the next conservative wacko doesn’t fall through the cracks.</p> <p>Moulitsas is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.</p></article>

The subtitle? “How to Make America Great Again.” Given GOP screaming about American exceptionalism and superiority, it’s kind of surprising the party’s presidential front-runner is overtly arguing that America is less than great.</p> <p>Then again, that’s a common theme among Republicans, who unreservedly describe today’s United States as a nightmarish hellhole.</p> <p>“[Our society is] very much like Nazi Germany,” said Ben Carson. “I know you’re not supposed to say ‘Nazi Germany,’ but I don’t care about political correctness. You know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.”</p> <p>In the mind of Carson — Trump’s chief rival for the nod in 2016 — Americans are getting sent to concentration camps, while the unlucky citizens who have survived are just slaves because they can now get affordable healthcare.</p> <p>“ObamaCare is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery. And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government.”</p> <p>So President Obama’s murderous police state is a nightmare and must be opposed? Well, unless you’re the wrong color.</p> <p>“[ <a type="internal">Barack Obama</a>] does not support the police, he doesn’t back up the police; he justifies Black Lives Matter,” whined New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another GOP White House contender. “I don’t believe that that movement should be justified when they’re calling for the murder of police officers.”</p> <p>In the conservative imagination, the government is run by despotic slave-owning Nazis, but the police state lacks police because they’re all being murdered.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Carly Fiorina got a couple of weeks’ mileage and a minor poll bump by indulging in outright fantasy about Planned Parenthood during one of the Republican presidential debates: “Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, ‘We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.’” Maybe a Nazi cop could’ve put a stop to it, if he hadn’t been murdered by a Black Lives Matter activist! (And if Planned Parenthood were doing what Fiorina says it’s doing, which it’s not.)</p> <p>And heaven knows Christians just can’t catch a break in this country anymore. “Christian convictions are under attack as never before,” claimed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who’s polling at 3 percent in the RealClearPolitics survey. “Not just in our lifetime, but ever before in the history of this great nation. We are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity.”</p> <p>But while Christians are under siege, Muslims are apparently running rampant in this country.</p> <p>“Without exaggeration, the Obama administration will become the world’s leading state sponsor and financier of radical Islamic terrorism,” said Texas Sen. <a type="internal">Ted Cruz</a>, yet another Republican vying for the presidential nomination next year, with maximum exaggeration. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) actually accused Democratic front-runner <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> of conspiring with al Qaeda prior to the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack — on national TV — because that’s the sort of nightmare America’s conservatives live in.</p> <p>And then there are all the jobs the Obama administration has killed. The Environmental Protection Agency is killing jobs. ObamaCare is killing jobs. Investing in green energy is killing jobs. Our current Kenyan socialist communist president has killed so many jobs that no one has a job anymore.</p> <p>Sure, in the real world the economy set a record with 63 consecutive months of job growth, but don’t try to let reality intrude into the conservative bubble. Their America is a hellhole, and they’re sticking with their fantasy ’til the bitter end.</p> <p>Moulitsas is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.</p></article>
	<article id="0001217" published-at="2016-03-29" title="Budowsky: Obama, you’re wrong about Sanders">
© Getty Images <p>On Monday, President Obama scolded journalists for not covering the substance of the presidential campaign. I entirely agree.</p> <p>Where I disagree with the president is when he criticizes <a type="internal">Bernie Sanders</a> and his supporters, as well as Donald Trump, by saying: “When people put their faith into someone who can’t possibly deliver his or her own promises, that only breeds more cynicism.”</p> <p>Obama is wrong — and insulting to voters — when he suggests that they need him or the media to determine whether they should put their faith in Sanders. Sanders supporters know exactly why they are supporting the Vermont senator.</p> <p>Sanders and his supporters believe — and I entirely agree — that Democrats should stand for powerful transforming change. They believe Democrats should mobilize armies of small donors and workers to support that change and should motivate more voters to come out on Election Day to elect more Democrats to the House and Senate, so that the party can negotiate with Republicans from a position of strength and a mandate for change.</p> <p>Obama and Democrats should consider with prayerful reflection why, since Obama became president, Democrats have lost control of the House, the Senate, governorships and state legislatures across the nation. It is fact, not opinion, that Democrats have suffered extreme damage at all levels during Obama’s presidency, because too many Republican voters were motivated to vote and too many Democratic voters were not inspired and stayed home.</p> <p>Before Obama further insults the intelligence and idealism of Sanders supporters by suggesting he knows better than they do about which candidate they should put their faith in, he might consider this: The sum of all polling, according to RealClearPolitics, finds that Sanders would defeat every Republican opponent in a general election, would defeat Trump by an epic landslide margin of more than 17 percent and runs stronger than <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> against all GOP opponents.</p> <p>My answer to Obama’s speech to journalists is not that Democrats should support Sanders or Clinton, but that it is profoundly unwise and destructive to Democrats for the president to gratuitously criticize Sanders and insult those who put their faith in him. Regardless of who is nominated, Sanders is a major part of the solution to the challenges that Democrats face, and when Obama criticizes Sanders he becomes the problem, not the solution.</p> <p>Make no mistake, Hillary Clinton is the probable nominee for the Democratic Party, and if she is nominated I will work like hell to get her elected. But make no mistake about this, either: Bernie Sanders still has a chance to win a majority of elected delegates, and he and his supporters should be respected.</p> <p>Sanders has touched a chord in American politics. He speaks to the heart of many Democrats. He offers the conviction politics of authenticity and principle that Americans hunger for and find sorely lacking in politics today. He thrills young people, appeals to independents and attracts blue-collar workers who might otherwise be tempted by Trump.</p> <p>If Obama wants to help his party do better than it has done so far on his watch, while offering high praise to Clinton, he should speak of Sanders with respect and admiration, not condescension and contempt. If he wants to elect more Democrats to the House and Senate, he should sing the praises of Sanders for inspiring small donors to give him more than $43 million in February, and he should offer those small donors a standing ovation worthy of their great aspirations. Then, perhaps, they will donate to progressive Democrats running for the House and Senate regardless of who is nominated for president.</p> <p>For the same reasons that Sanders should avoid negative attacks against Clinton, Obama should avoid negative opining about Sanders and condescension toward his supporters, who bring enthusiasm, idealism and commitment to the cause that serves all Democrats and is as precious as gold to any nominee, whoever he or she may ultimately be.</p> <p>Budowsky was an aide to former Sens.

© Getty Images <p>Poor <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a>. Despite (or because of) being born into luxury and ease, his brain is simply wired wrong. It prevents him from performing simple tasks, like processing reality.</p> <p>That’s why the real estate tycoon looks out his window and sees a dystopian hellhole. “Crippled America” screams the headline of his latest book, in which he promises to “make America great again.” His first ad in Iowa featured a black-and white montage of the shooters in San Bernardino, Calif., body bags, missiles being launched from ships, buildings being destroyed by bombs, people swarming across a border and an ominous voice warning against terrorists and immigrants who are out to kill us.</p> <p>Trump is tickled when murderous fascists like Vladimir Putin fête him. He supports waterboarding even if it doesn’t work because “they deserve it.” He imagines hordes of African-Americans murdering white people. He thinks it’s funny to mock Hillary Clinton for going to the bathroom.</p> <p>Trump had three young girls sing a campaign song at a rally with lyrics like “President Donald Trump knows how to make America great! Deal from strength or get crushed every time!” and “Enemies of freedom, face the music! C’mon boys! Take ’em down.” Utterly creepy. And if Trump is president, every store will say “Merry Christmas!” because apparently he plans to eliminate both the free exercise and free speech clauses of the First Amendment.</p> <p>So, given that Trump’s America is a bombed-out husk of a dead civilization, it follows that it’s <a type="internal">President Obama</a>’s fault. “They’re babies,” he said. “They don’t know what they’re doing ... it’s so embarrassing.”</p> <p>What’s actually embarrassing is, well, Trump himself.</p> <p>The Obama administration has delivered affordable healthcare to almost 18 million formerly uninsured Americans and has added 13.7 million new jobs in seven years, compared to a laughable 1.3 million during George W. Bush’s tenure.</p> <p>Diplomacy has thawed relations with Cuba and Iran. When two American gunboats were confiscated after drifting into Iranian waters, diplomacy resolved the issue in a matter of hours, to the GOP’s chagrin. America can’t be under siege if we’re being civil to our enemies, can it? And there’s that little matter of halting Iran’s nuclear program.</p> <p>We’ve seen al Qaeda decapitated and a marked decrease in terrorism-related deaths in the United States — 101 during Obama’s term, compared to 3,279 during Bush’s. And despite conservative hysteria, the number of Americans killed by terrorists overseas between 2001 and 2013 was only 350. Every death is problematic, of course, which is why it’s bizarre that Republicans don’t care about the 406,496 people killed by firearms in the United States during that same period.</p> <p>Remember the Ebola panic? Republicans ripped into Obama for refusing to quarantine the entire nation and impose a travel ban. And then all of America died — didn’t it?</p> <p>It’s now easier to afford college, we’ve begun the transition to a non-fossil-fuel economy, we’re taking global climate change more seriously (because if Florida underwater isn’t dystopian, what is?), there’s greater oversight of Wall Street (though it could be tougher) and we are a far more tolerant and equal society today. Racists and bigots might hate that, but they are now the fringe minority.</p> <p>Is everything perfect in Obama’s America? Of course not, and liberals can be just as critical of the president as conservatives. The difference is, our criticism is based on reality, not a trumped-up ideological fantasy.</p> <p>Moulitsas is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.</p></article>

In it, Podesta provides a list of attack lines the strategists discussed putting into a survey.</p> <p>Begala, who now runs a super PAC backing Clinton's presidential bid, tweeted that the research was conducted on behalf of an “independent progressive” political action committee led by an Obama supporter. He said the group also ran polling on potential attack lines against Clinton.</p> <p>The point of the polling, Begala said, was to determine the candidates’ potential weaknesses ahead of the general election.</p> <p>The WikiLeaks emails indicate the super PAC also tested attack lines about Sen. <a type="internal">John McCain</a> (Ariz.), who ultimately won the GOP nomination that year. The <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2336" type="external">email chain</a> carried the subject line “McCain Survey- Take 3.”</p> <p>The poll questions about Obama, as written in the emails, included:</p> <p>- Obama (owe-BAHM-uh)'s father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world's most populous Islamic country."</p> <p>- Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) is ranked as one of the ten most liberal members of the Senate because of his support of issues like gay adoption."</p> <p>- Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) described his former use of cocaine as using "a little blow."</p> <p>Conservative opposition research groups passed around the email highlighting the Muslim question.</p> <p>Tom Matzzie, the former Washington director for the liberal group MoveOn.org, said the poll was taken to see how voters responded to potential attacks against Clinton and Obama by Republicans.</p> <p>Those on the email were ready to defend whoever won the Democratic nomination, Begala said, as he did once Obama defeated Clinton in the primaries.</p> <p>Clinton’s campaign has hammered her GOP rival, Donald Trump, for promoting doubts that President Obama was born in the U.S. and rejected Trump’s assertion that she was responsible for fanning the racially charged rumor in 2008.</p> <p>In a Friday conference call with reporters, the Clinton campaign lashed out at WikiLeaks, calling the Russian hack of Podesta’s emails an “unprecedented and alarming attack” on U.S. democracy meant to influence the election in favor of Trump.</p> <p>Clinton’s team criticized Trump for his flattering comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin and ripped him for encouraging further cyberattacks that they say endanger the nation's sovereignty.</p> <p>The Clinton campaign has not confirmed or denied the authenticity of the Podesta emails. Spokesman Nick Merrill sought to cast doubt on the emails, though, saying they could have been manipulated.</p></article>

But now that he's in office, it is becoming more obvious that was not his intention at all.</p> <p>Instead of putting more money into essential domestic programs (Environmental Protection Agency, education, job training, National Institutes of Health, Meals on Wheels), Trump wants to increase the defense budget for the military by $52.3 billion at the expense of vital domestic programs.</p> <p>In the America under this myopic budget, children at home will potentially have their educational programming taken away via PBS funding cuts, local communities could have toxic sites remain uncleaned thanks to the massive EPA cuts, and people will be much worse-off with significant cuts coming to the NIH which provide essential health-related research.</p> <p>In 2015, 13.1 million children lived in food insecure households, while 13 percent of all American households were considered food insecure. Just imagine what almost $53 billion could do for hungry children and families.</p> <p>The U.S. already spends obscene amounts of money on its defense program. In 2015, the country had a declared military and defense budget of $601 billion. Why should the military have more money when it could be spent on feeding U.S. citizens and giving our children a better education? If Trump truly wanted to "Make America great again," he would know that requires reinvesting in America and its citizens!</p> <p>Trump needs to stop dwelling on the past and thinking a higher-funded military will somehow be the answer to all of our domestic problems.</p> <p>The U.S. cannot continue to spending money overseas when people are home are hungry and need better education. Sign to show your support for prioritizing domestic enrichment over war, poverty, and death!</p> The Petition: <p>Dear President Trump,</p> <p>You said you wanted to "make America great again," but your new budget plan is actually taking money away from domestic programs that people rely on and you are giving that money to the military instead.</p> <p>Right now, our military is already spending more than the rest of the world by a massive margin. Is it really that important to keep pushing money into something that already has so much when people at home are suffering?</p></article>
	<article id="0001221" published-at="2017-09-24" title="Disrespecting The National Anthem And The American Flag Are Not Legitimate Forms Of Political Protest"><a type="internal"/> <p>This is going to backfire on the left in a major way. On Sunday, more than a hundred NFL players knelt during the playing of the national anthem. It was obviously an attempt to make some sort of public statement about President Trump, but it was an exceedingly poor way to go about doing that. Because our young people are not even taught about the importance of our national anthem and our national flag in school, most of these players didn’t even understand what they were doing. Our anthem is sung and our flag is proudly displayed prior to major sporting events for a reason. The truth is that our national anthem and our national flag are both symbols that directly represent our nation. In other words, when you show disrespect to the anthem or to the flag you are literally showing disrespect to the United States of America. So what these players did on Sunday was essentially to spit in the face of every single American citizen.</p> <p>This is not just an American thing. All over the world it is well understood that respect for the national flag and other national symbols is not optional. What transpired at NFL games on Sunday will be broadcast all over the planet, and the rest of the world will be laughing at our national disgrace.</p> <p>The very first NFL game scheduled on Sunday was held in London, and <a href="http://americanmilitarynews.com/2017/09/nfls-ravens-steelers-to-not-participate-in-anthem-to-avoid-controversy/?utm_source=quayle&amp;utm_campaign=alt&amp;utm_medium=facebook" type="external">“dozens of players from both teams”</a> knelt while the national anthem was being played…</p> <q> <p>The first game of the day between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars saw dozens of players from both teams kneel while almost the entire Jaguars’ on-field and sideline players and employees locked arms during the U.S. national anthem, including owner Shahid Khan. Some players stood while others knelt.</p> </q> <p>And of course similar “sideline protests” happened at other NFL stadiums all over the nation. Never before in American history have we ever seen <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/09/24/donald-trump-nfl-player-protests-national-anthem-week-3-response/697609001/" type="external">anything quite like this</a>…</p> <q> <p>Demonstrations spread throughout the league as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity.</p> <p>Several players from the Buffalo Bills, Denver Broncos, New York Giants, Detroit Lions, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons were among those who chose not to stand for the anthem. The Miami Dolphins, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles, Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, Los Angeles Chargers and Green Bay Packers stood with arms locked, though some players from those teams chose to kneel.</p> </q> <p>I honestly don’t think that the NFL will ever be the same after this. It had already been transformed into the “no fun league”, and now the focus will squarely be on political protests rather than football for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Needless to say, millions upon millions of Americans were completely disgusted by the disrespect shown to our national symbols on Sunday, and President Trump <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/23/trump-vs-pro-sports-president-finds-new-target-in-america-first-agenda.html" type="external">was one of them</a>…</p> <q> <p>“If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect …,” Trump said in tweets Saturday afternoon. “Our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!”</p> </q> <p>If professional football players want to speak out against President Trump, I have no problem with that whatsoever.</p> <p>But for them to openly and brazenly disrespect our entire country is crossing a line that should never be crossed.</p> <p>What in the world has happened to America? All over America high school football coaches are being banned from saying prayers before games, and yet disrespecting our anthem and our flag is somehow acceptable? The following comes from <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-24/trumps-feud-nfl-escalates-patriots-owner-says-he-deeply-disappointed-presidents-comm" type="external">Zero Hedge</a>…</p> <q> <p>Marc Short, the president’s legislative director, has also backed his boss, telling “Meet the Press” that a double standard for players who chose to voice their views on the field, and that the president was speaking for the majority of Americans on what sort of expression was appropriate. Short compared a crackdown on protests to the ban on high school football coaches leading players in prayer before games.</p> <p>“There are high school coaches across America today who are punished for leading their players in prayer, and yet, when an N.F.L. player takes a knee, somehow that player is presumed to be a martyr for a social cause,” Mr. Short said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “The president is standing with the vast majority of Americans who believe that our flag should be respected.”</p> </q> <p>Many of these players are going to look back on what they have done with great shame. They may have believed that they were disrespecting President Trump, but the truth is that they were disrespecting this great land and every single American that has ever lived. They owe all of us an apology, and that should happen as soon as possible.</p> <p>And the NFL may think that it is all powerful, but stunts like this are going to cost it millions upon millions of dollars. Already, ratings were way down <a href="https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister/anthem-protests-top-reason-fans-watched-fewer-nfl-games-1-6-tuned-out-track" type="external">because of the few players that were kneeling whenever the anthem was played</a>…</p> <q> <p>Player protests of the National Anthem – such as when quarterback Colin <a href="http://www.barstoolsports.com/boston/the-ravens-are-doing-opinion-polls-to-decide-if-they-should-sign-colin-kaepernick" type="external">Kaepernick took a knee in protest</a> – are the number one reason sports fans watched fewer National Football League (NFL) games, a new survey shows.</p> </q> <p>If just a few players kneeling had that much of an impact on the ratings, what do you think is going to happen now?</p> <p>Unfortunately, I have a feeling that this is just the beginning.

	<article id="0001223" published-at="2016-09-10" title="Zakir Naik: What have I done to earn 'terror preacher' tag?"><p>NEW DELHI: Controversial Islamic preacher <a type="internal">Zakir Naik</a>, in an open letter to Indians, has claimed that he was being targetted for being a popular figure among Muslims and that demonising him was part of a larger 'conspiracy' to attack the community. Naik + is under the scanner of Indian investigative agencies for allegedly inspiring terrorists with his speeches.</p> <p>Stating that his Islamic Research Foundation + ( <a type="internal">IRF</a>) and he had been "set up" for a ban, "never mind the lack of evidence", he accused the government of using "desperate measures to kill peace and harmony".</p> <p>Putting a set of five questions to his fellow citizens, Naik wondered why he was being labelled a "terror preacher" now when he had been delivering speeches on Islam for the past 25 years. He also claimed that fresh probes were being undertaken against him and his NGO IRF despite past investigations having found no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing on their part.</p> <p>Raising the recent renewal of IRF's foreign funding licence, followed by revoking of the renewal and suspension of four home ministry officers, Naik asked if this was because the renewal was "against the laid down agenda of the government?". "Why would you suspend FCRA officials? Is it because they did things by the book?" he asked.</p> <p>The televangelist sought to question the "selective leaking of government documents to the media". "The one and only investigation report submitted till now remains inconclusive, but the solicitor general's 'judgment' of banning IRF and I was duly leaked....Is this how IRF will be banned? By creating an atmosphere of ban? Rather than rely on proofs and evidences?" he asked.</p> <p>Also countering the allegations of forced conversions against him and the IRF, Naik dared the government to produce the converted person along with the statement about "how he or she was forcibly converted". "Isn't this the most basic proof of forced conversion? The fact is, there never was forced conversion," he argued.</p> <p>Stating that he had been preaching for 25 years, Naik said the move to act against him was part of a deeper agenda to attack <a type="internal">Indian Muslims</a>. "What exactly did I do now to earn the tags of 'terror preacher', 'Dr. Terror' and 'hate monger'? Of 150 countries where I'm respected and my talks are welcomed, I'm being called a terrorist influence in my own country. What an irony. Why now, when I've been doing the same thing for over 25 years?" he asked.</p> <p>"If IRF and I are banned, it will be biggest jolt to the country's democracy...this ban will set a precedence of unspeakable injustices against the 20 crore Muslims of India. This action will embolden and encourage every fringe element in the country to do as they please. If you thought intolerance increased in the country recently, this action of the government will take it to an all-time high," he alleged.</p> We recommend this video for youWMG INTERNATIONAL INC <a href="javascript:void(0)" type="external"/>TAP TO WATCH <p>Stating that he had tried to stay away from the spotlight trained on him following claims by two terrorists behind the July 1 attack in Dhaka that they were inspired by his speeches, Naik said he felt it best to continue with his work and not pay attention to his detractors. "But I soon realised that this time it was different. there was much greater media involvement, and a much deeper government's involvement," he alleged.</p> <p>In an appeal to Indians, Naik, who is currently abroad, pleaded: "If you find any wrongdoing on my part, punish me by all means....I'm open to any investigation."</p> <p>"To all, my appeal is do not allow subversion of the Constitution.

Image: via Twitter <p>Who politely refused.</p> <p>Who knew the swamp was this deep? At 6′ 8″, James Comey is going under.</p> <p>A whistleblower reported last year that the National Security Agency (NSA) was in possession of Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails. With the corruption and lawlessness inside the Obama administration, the existence of those emails was a jealously guarded secret.</p> <p>Now it is being reported that FBI director James Comey was offered those emails by the NSA — and he refused them, obviously to keep the likely very incriminating evidence out of the case he was charged with investigating impartially. The swamp gets deeper.</p> <p>Numerous reports coming out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week said that former Comey made the decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution <a type="internal">long before he even interviewed key witnesses, including Hillary.</a></p> <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/04/proof-that-investigating-trump-is-starting-to-backfire-for-democrats/" type="external">New York Post</a> reports new bombshell under the umbrella headline “Proof that investigating Trump is starting to backfire for Democrats,” which also reminds us that Comey chastised Clinton harshly on TV before recommending that she not be prosecuted. Post author John Crudele adds:</p> <q> <p>Comey fibbed when he said his agents unanimously agreed that prosecution was unnecessary. In fact, my source says that FBI agents were irate about the decision not to go after Clinton.</p> <p>The controversy got pretty intense, which may be why Comey forced agents who worked on the Clinton matter to sign additional nondisclosure agreements.</p> </q> <p>For your convenience, you may leave commments below using either the <a type="internal">Spot.IM commenting system</a> or the <a type="internal">Facebook commenting system</a>.

© Francis Rivera <p>Conspiracy-minded, fact-challenged conservatives have whipped themselves into a lather of a narrative about <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a>, one that demands she be jailed immediately for ... something. You want reasons? She supposedly helped <a type="internal">Bill Clinton</a> cover up rape, helped another rapist beat the rap, stole money from the Clinton Foundation, willfully caused the death of State Department personnel in Benghazi, made deals with our enemies as secretary of State to enrich her family, and endangered national security by sending emails from a private server — one, incidentally, that wasn’t hacked by Russian intelligence.</p> <p>And maybe, just maybe, one of those will be validated by reality. Worth a shot, right?</p> <p>In truth, there is zero evidence to support any of those allegations despite the best efforts of the entire conservative movement and much of the media. If the Clinton Foundation suffered a fraction of the problems of Trump’s, the media outrage would be deafening, yet not a single instance of quid pro quo has been unearthed.</p> <p>Seven Republican investigations into the Benghazi, Libya, terror attacks found nothing. So, they became probes of her emails, hoping to find something, anything, to pin on her. Unfortunately for them, there was nothing incriminating, illegal, or untoward. Nothing.</p> <p>So now, during an unrelated investigation into scumbag Anthony Weiner, the FBI may have found something of relevance, but who knows? We’ll just make a big announcement, so that everyone can assume the worst of Clinton, yet again, without a single fact to buttress the hysteria. And really, what could possibly be in those emails that would justify this witch-hunt atmosphere? Emails to al Qaeda giving them directions to our facility in Benghazi?</p> <p>Of course, there’s zero interest in the truth. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said the FBI should only comment further on those new emails if anything of substance is found. Otherwise, clearing Clinton yet again would only be perceived as “rigging” the election. Very convenient. She’s guilty if she did it, guilty if she didn’t. But then again, how is that different than the GOP’s decades-long crusade against her?</p> <p>And even if those emails prove to be innocuous and irrelevant, we can probably expect a new round of investigations into Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s use of different computers to access her emails. Because, you know, if you at first don’t succeed, try, try again.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as FBI Director James Comey stokes the anti-Clinton cause with selective leaks, he refuses to comment on something of real substance: the apparent link between Russia and the Trump campaign. Or as Senate Minority Leader <a type="internal">Harry Reid</a> (D-Nev.) wrote in a letter to the director, “in my communications with you … it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government — a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.” Yet at least one source told CNBC that Comey has refused to publicly reveal that information for fear of affecting the election. Or, more aptly, for fear of affecting Trump’s electoral chances.</p> <p>Of course, this is all Sturm und Drang, as few if any minds are being changed. People are locked into their partisan preferences, and no new Trump tapes or Clinton emails will change any votes. The choices of our electorate are baked in.</p> <p>But that won’t stop Republicans from continuing their witch hunt once Clinton is in office, no matter how lacking any evidence might be.</p> <p>Moulitsas is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.</p></article>

(Photo, Kyle Melnick, Diamondback) <p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (ABC7) —</p> <p>Multiple members of the University of Maryland's student marching band appeared to kneel during the National Anthem before Maryland's game against Northwestern on Saturday.</p> <p>Kyle Melnick, a Maryland student and reporter for the Diamondback, the school's student newspaper, got pictures of a few members of the "Mighty Sound of Maryland" kneeling during the anthem before the Terrapins' game against the Wildcats.</p> <p>The act of demonstrating during the anthem gained major attention in the 2016 NFL preseason after then San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem as a protest of police discrimination against people of color. Kaepernick then began kneeling during the anthem as the season progressed.</p> <p>Others at multiple levels of sports followed his example, either kneeling, sitting or raising a fist during the song.</p> <p>The movement has grown even larger in 2017 after President <a href="http://wjla.com/news/nation-world/trump-tweets-anew-about-nfl-players-national-anthem-protest" type="external">Donald Trump proposed firing any NFL players who kneeled during the anthem.</a></p> <p>No Maryland football players have been seen kneeling this season.</p> <p>Earlier in the year, the band made the decision to <a href="http://wjla.com/news/local/umd-pregame-song-maryland-my-maryland-suspended-for-pro-confederate-tone-in-lyrics" type="external">stop playing the state song "Maryland My Maryland"</a> because of its "pro-Confederate" tone.</p></article>

© Getty Images <p>Not since the days of the racist governors of the segregationist South has any American politician so embodied values that are alien to the American idea as <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> does today.</p> <p>In the America that true patriots love, we are a large and diverse nation of immigrants that came from around the world to build a special place where all people should be treated as equal in a national community of mutual respect and shared purpose.</p> <p>In the America that the Republican presidential front-runner would create, our republic would become a sectarian war zone. Our democracy would become a place where those with different views would be treated as enemies ruled by a bully who campaigns on a cult of negativity and has recently been called liar of the year by a nationally respected fact-checker.</p> <p>In the America envisioned by Democratic presidential front-runner <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a>, young women could be proud to vote for the first female president. In the America envisioned by Trump, a woman running for the Republican nomination can be demeaned for having a face that the bully considers ugly, and a highly respected television host can be called a bimbo.</p> <p>In the America envisioned by Democratic candidate <a type="internal">Bernie Sanders</a>, our country would be a place where justice rules the day and economic fairness becomes a way of life. In the America envisioned by Trump, when a black man is beaten up at a rally filled with the politics of dog-whistle bigotry, the candidate suggests that perhaps that man deserved the beating.</p> <p>In the America envisioned by <a type="internal">John McCain</a> — and his father and grandfather before — words such as duty, honor, country and service are a family tradition.</p> <p>McCain, a hero of modern American history, defied his captors in Vietnam and let these true enemies of America continue to torture him because he refused to be released until all of his brother POWs were released by his side. All the while, Trump collected draft deferments on his way to becoming a bully who campaigns to be commander in chief by demeaning POWs as losers, because the man who never served prefers troops who were never captured.</p> <p>In the America we love, young people are taught that Lady Liberty will always shine brightly in New York Harbor. In the America that Trump envisions, the lie that the Mexican government sends immigrants to America is compounded by the slander that those Hispanic immigrants are mostly rapists and murderers.</p> <p>In the America that is great, we were raised by our parents and taught in the houses of worship of many faiths to do unto others as we would wish others do unto us.</p> <p>In the America that would be ruled by the bully, moms and dads of disabled girls and boys must worry their children might inadvertently witness disgusting impersonations of the disabled on television by a man who dares to presume he is worthy to lead the nation while he seeks to lower the standards of our politics to the gutter.</p> <p>Throughout the nobler moments of our history, Americanism was embodied and defended by men and women from all backgrounds with all points of view who believed that in this land we love, America is a place where we are all in this together. That concept is alien to Trump’s politics, which makes Trump’s ambition alien to the spirit of America.</p> <p>The Americans who defeated fascism in wartime did not consider their comrades in arms or the united nation behind them to be fat slobs, bimbos, rapists, murderers, idiots or morons, or disabled Americans worthy of being demeaned by a clown who is unfit to be a commander.</p> <p>Donald Trump has more in common with the neofascist parties in Europe than with any great party that has ever led our nation. He would not make America great. He would make America hate.</p> <p>Many leading Republicans in America privately agree with what I write. Most of them lack the courage to say it.

Ms. Abedin was, for many years, listed as an associate editor of the London-based publication and wrote for the journal while working as an intern in the Clinton White House in the mid-1990s.</p> <p>Her mother, Saleha Abedin, <a href="http://www.shoebat.com/documents/Huma_Brotherhood_Connections_072412.pdf" type="external">sits on the Presidency Staff Council</a> of the International Islamic Council for Da’wa and Relief, a group that is chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi.</p> <p>Perhaps recognizing how offensive such ties will be to voters concerned over future terrorist attacks on this country by radical Muslims professing allegiance to Sharia law, the Clinton campaign on Monday <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/08/21/huma-abedin-denies-active-role-at-radical-muslim-journal/" type="external">tried to downplay</a> Ms. Abedin’s involvement in the Journal and the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>The Clinton surrogate group Media Matters claimed predictably there was “no evidence” that Ms. Abedin or her family had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and that Trump campaign staffers who spoke of these ties were <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2016/08/22/another-muslim-brotherhood-conspiracy-theorist-becomes-trump-adviser/212575" type="external">conspiracy theorists</a>.</p> <p>To debunk the evidence, Media Matters pointed to a <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslimgovernment.asp" type="external">Snopes.com “fact-check” piece</a> that cited as its sole source… Senator <a type="internal">John McCain</a>. This is the same John McCain who met Libyan militia leader Abdelkarim Belhaj, a known al Qaeda associate, and saluted him as “my hero” during a 2011 visit to Benghazi.</p> <p>Senator McCain and others roundly criticized Rep. <a type="internal">Michele Bachmann</a> in 2012 when she and four members of the House Permanent Select Committee Intelligence and the House Judiciary Committee cited Ms. Abedin in letters sent to the Inspectors General of the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, warning about Muslim Brotherhood infiltration of the United States government.</p> <p>In response to those critiques, Rep. Bachmann laid out the evidence in <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/100244266/Bachmann-Letter-Responding-to-Ellison" type="external">a 16-page memo,</a> which has never been refuted by Senator McCain or the elite media.</p> <p>The evidence, in my opinion, is overwhelming: Huma Abedin is nothing short of a Muslim Brotherhood princess, born into an illustrious family of Brotherhood leaders.</p> <p>Her father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, was a professor in Saudi Arabia who founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs, an institution established by the Government of Saudi Arabia with the support of the Muslim World League.</p> <p>The Muslim World League was “perhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world,” according to former federal prosecutor <a href="https://pjmedia.com/andrewmccarthy/2012/07/27/huma-abedins-brotherhood-ties-are-not-just-a-family-affair/" type="external">Andrew C. McCarthy.</a> Its then-General Secretary, Umar Nasif, founded the Rabita Trust, “which is formally designated as a foreign terrorist organization under American law due to its support of al Qaeda,” he wrote.</p> <p>That is not guilt by association but what federal prosecutors would call a “nexus” of like-minded people who shared the same goals.</p> <p>A Saudi government document <a href="http://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Abedins-Mein-Kampf-copy.pdf" type="external">inspired by Ms. Abedin’s father</a> explains the concept of “Muslim Minority Affairs,” the title of the Journal Mr. Abedin founded, and its goal to “establish a global Sharia in our modern times.”</p> <p>Simply put, Huma Abedin worked for thirteen years as part of an enterprise whose explicit goal was to conquer the West in the name of Islam. No wonder the Clinton campaign wants to sweep this issue under the rug.</p> <p>Mrs. Clinton has sometimes referred to Huma Abedin as her “second daughter.” Whether it was because of their close relationship or for some other reason, Mrs. Clinton has done much to further the Muslim Brotherhood agenda while Secretary of State, and can be counted on doing more as president.</p> <p>As Secretary of State, she relentlessly pushed the overthrow of Libyan leader Mohammar Qaddafi, a dire enemy of the Brotherhood, even when President Obama and his Secretary of Defense were reluctant to go to war.</p> <p>Along with Obama, she pushed for the overthrow of Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak and his replacement by Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammad Morsi.</p> <p>She pushed for direct U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war, including the arming of Syrian rebels allied with al Qaeda.</p> <p>As I reveal <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gsd465r" type="external">in my new book</a>, she worked side by side with the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the umbrella group where 57 majority Muslim states pushed their agenda of imposing Sharia law on the non-Muslim world, to use hate crime laws in the United States to criminalize speech critical of Islam, in accordance with United Nations Resolution 16/18.</p> <p>Their first victim in the United States was a Coptic Christian named Nakoula Bassiley Nakoula, the maker of the YouTube video Hillary and Obama blamed for Benghazi.</p> <p>New Abedin emails released to Judicial Watch this week show that Huma Abedin <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/new-abedin-emails-reveal-hillary-clinton-state-department-gave-special-access-top-clinton-foundation-donors/" type="external">served as liaison</a> between Clinton Foundation donors, including foreign governments, and the State Department.</p> <p>When foreign donors had difficult in getting appointments with Mrs. Clinton through normal State Department channels, Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band would email Huma Abedin, and poof! the doors would open as if by magic.</p> <p><a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> has criticized this as “pay for play.” But it also raises questions as to whether Huma Abedin and Mrs. Clinton were in fact serving as unregistered agents for foreign powers who sought to impose their anti-freedom agenda on the United States.</p> <p>The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization in 2014.

Mark Zuckerberg is under investigation in Germany. <p>Germany's fight against hate speech has reached Mark Zuckerberg himself.</p> <p>A German prosecutor has named Zuckerberg, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and European Facebook executives in a preliminary investigation, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/facebook-staatsanwaltschaft-ermittelt-gegen-mark-zuckerberg-a-1119746.html" type="external">according to German media</a>.</p> <p>The investigation was prompted by a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/facebook-staatsanwaltschaft-ermittelt-gegen-mark-zuckerberg-a-1119746.html" type="external">lawsuit filed by</a> Chan-jo Jun, an attorney who filed a similar complaint a year ago. This one, which said that Facebook failed to remove hate speech even once it was aware of the violations of German law, singled out Zuckerberg by name.</p> <p>“We are not commenting on the status of a possible investigation but we can say that the allegations lack merit and there has been no violation of German law by Facebook or its employees," Facebook said in a statement. "There is no place for hate on Facebook. We work closely with partners to fight hate speech and foster counter speech.“</p> <p>The investigation and lawsuit are tied to a broader crackdown against online hate speech. A German justice minister said earlier this week that Facebook and Twitter would both be required to improve their responses to hate speech or face legal action, the Associated Press <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2016-11-01/germany-clock-ticking-for-facebook-to-act-over-hate-speech" type="external">reported</a>.</p> <p>Germany has strict laws surrounding hate speech.

The media, liberals, and all of your anti-Trump Facebook friends have been absolutely obsessed with this recording.</p> <p>In effort to take some heat off of himself, Trump brought Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick to that debate. The one thing all of these women have in common is that they’ve accused <a type="internal">Bill Clinton</a> of sexual assault. What’s that? Bill isn’t running for the White House? If you honestly believe the Clintons haven’t been working as one well-oiled machine since the 1970s, then I have <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/10/trump-taj-mahal-bankrupt-icahn-pictures/" type="external">a casino to sell to you</a>.</p> <p>It’s absolutely important that the media covers Trump’s offensive words and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-13/trump-rips-times-people-magazine-over-sexual-assault-claims" type="external">accusers</a>. But journalists are showing their bias by refusing to give fair coverage to the <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/17/on-rape-liberals-dont-believe-the-victim" type="external">Clintons’ alleged actions</a>. Why won’t the left, including Hillary, live up to her own standards? And more importantly, why won’t the press? Trump’s words are offensive, but the alleged actions of Bill Clinton are <a href="http://www.apple.com" type="external">extremely disturbing</a>.</p> <p>As such, even though he is not running for office, it’s fair to ask what it means that Hillary would stand by such a man — for such a long time — when these sorts of accusations have dogged him every step of the way. And again, even though he’s not running for office, a win for Hillary puts Bill back in the White House, and back on the largest stage imaginable.</p> <p>"Believe the victims," shouts the feminist-left, often from their Twitter accounts. <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> has even raised her voice with theirs, tweeting: "You have the right to be believed, and we're with you.” Unfortunately for Hillz, Broaddrick, the woman who accused Bill Clinton of rape in 1978, also <a href="https://twitter.com/atensnut/status/684822324227379200" type="external">took to Twitter in effort to keep her accusation alive</a>. As you may have guessed, Hillary’s original tweet was deleted shortly after.</p> <p>With so many on the left claiming that all sexual assault victims deserve to be believed, why then aren’t the numerous women who Bill Clinton allegedly sexually assaulted <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/17/on-rape-liberals-dont-believe-the-victim" type="external">treated with respect or seriousness in the mainstream media</a>? Instead these women are dismissed or even worse, <a href="http://www.apple.com" type="external">slut-shamed by the usual talking heads</a>.</p> <p>Even though it seemed distasteful to many viewers for Trump to trot these alleged victims out as props for the debate, sitting them in the front row as heartbreaking reminders of the evil that men can do to women, at least it kept them in the discussion.</p> <p>Much like Bill Cosby, if properly investigated and given the attention such claims deserve, a snowball effect might occur with more women coming forward. But maybe that’s exactly why these charges continue to be ignored.</p> <p>The human brain is a pattern-making machine. After a predator selects a victim for the first time, whether what follows takes the form of an ill-intentioned seduction or full-on sexual assault, the predator’s brain learns one of two things from the result: If caught and punished, the brain learns a lesson. If there are no tangible consequences, the predator has no reason to reform.</p> <p>Serial abusers of women will continue to act with impunity as long as they have no reason to think they’ll be punished.</p> <p>Those women seated in the front row of that debate hall were a reminder that if guilty of their alleged crimes, Bill has not learned the right lesson. He would’ve never had to. And if you believe these accusers you would have to agree that for her part, Hillary has obviously never insisted that her husband be held accountable.</p> <p>That, on its own, is enough to call her judgment and morals into question.</p> <p>Kristin Tate is a conservative columnist and author of the book "Government Gone Wild: How D.C.

However, once viewers read the 4 horrific words she wrote, they were sickened that a woman so depraved could be teaching their children.</p> While civilians are still dying after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, a liberal teacher offered 4 sickening words for the victims. (Photo credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/914767396837089280/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.informationliberation.com%2F%3Fid%3D57444" type="external">Twitter</a>, Ethan Miller/Getty Images) <p>When mass murders occur in the U.S., the liberals cross their fingers in the hope that the killer isn’t a devout Muslim terrorist. If the killer appears to be non-Muslim, the left immediately propagates that it must be a right-wing white nationalist. Disturbingly, their hope that they can blame peaceful conservatives is only outweighed by their cowardly support for such depraved mass murderers as one teacher openly pointed out.</p> <p>According to <a href="http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=57444" type="external">Information Liberation</a>, a woman identified only by the Twitter name @TheResistANNce publicly called for followers to “pray” that only Trump supporters were among the 50+ fatalities of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino shooting, requesting that viewers “pray only trumptards died.” Even more disturbing is that the Twitter user is allegedly a teacher, although her identity and location are unknown.</p> An unidentified liberal “teacher” celebrated the Las Vegas shooting by calling for followers to pray that only Trump supporters would die. (Photo credit: Twitter) <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/914767396837089280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.informationliberation.com%2F%3Fid%3D57444" type="external">Columbia Bugle</a> brought attention to the woman’s despicable support for mass murder before the user deleted her account.</p> <q> <p>“Very disturbing that this woman is a teacher,” commented the Columbia Bugle. “Tragic that a woman as sick as her is teaching young minds.”</p> </q> <p>Still, the self-described teacher wasn’t the only liberal who hopes that Trump supporters and white people were slaughtered at the event, according to <a href="https://www.infowars.com/leftist-teacher-celebrates-white-trump-supporters-being-killed-in-las-vegas-massacre/" type="external">Info Wars</a>.</p> <q> <p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/914838461563195398/photo/1" type="external">Twitter user</a> lauded the massacre by tweeting, “Shooting at country music festival in Las Vegas?! Looks like revenge on those Trump supporters.”</p> <p>A user then replied, “dud slayed” and “kill, kill, kill, especially the white man,” along with a series of skulls and laughing emojis.</p> <p>“I hope they killed more than 25 Trump supporters lol,” tweeted another.</p> </q> <p>When liberals weren’t expressing their support for the shooter, they were attempting to spin the attack for their own narrative. Piers Morgan tweeted, “If the shooter was Muslim, we’d call this a terrorist attack.” He then spread false news that the shooting was undoubtedly a terror attack by a “white American,” despite the fact that authorities have not yet come forward with any suspected motive and that Muslims can also be white Americans. Additionally, for an attack to be considered a terror attack, the attacker must have a political motivation, just like when Muslims commit acts of violence in support of Islamic Sharia law.</p> <p>The truth of the matter is that suspect Stephen Craig Paddock used an illegal firearm in a <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/update-route-91-harvest-festival-las-vegas-gun-free-zone/" type="external">liberal gun-free zone</a> and, so far, according to his family and authorities has no political affiliation. Whether he was a recent Muslim convert, as ISIS claims, or just a deranged, evil man who had an unnatural bloodlust, the truth still stands that the left is more closely related to mass murderers than any Second-Amendment-supporting, freedom-loving, conservative American, as they continue to prove with their sadistic tweets.</p> <p>Perhaps telling about Paddock’s possible motivation is linked to his live-in “companion’s” tendency to fall for far-left anti-Trump liberals. Paddock’s partner, Marilou Danley, is still married to <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/10/stephen-paddock-politics-political-views-beliefs-opinions-trump-stances-democrat-republican-las-vegas-shooting/" type="external">Geary Danley</a>, whose social media profile showcases his hatred for Trump and conservatives and his unwavering support for progressive liberalism.</p> <p>The truth of the matter is that you’re more likely to be killed by a devout leftist, or Muslim for that matter, than by a gun-toting conservative hillbilly. Of course, the liberals who delight in such evil acts of violence but are too cowardly to actually commit one themselves are hiding behind social media accounts, applauding and drooling over the possibility of Americans dying for simply having a different opinion.</p></article>
	<article id="0001235" published-at="2017-06-13" title="He Had No Business Becoming President"><p>As a Democrat, I have no reservation saying that America needs a strong Republican Party. We live in a two-party system and there are very real policy debates that we should be having.</p> <p>With that said, this Republican Party is failing themselves and failing Americans as a whole at resembling anything close to a major political party.</p> <p>Let’s be honest for a minute. Republican support of Donald Trump is clearly less about Trump and more about former President Obama. It’s a guttural reaction. As hard as Republicans may have tried, they have been completely unable to erase our first black president from the history books.</p> <p>It tears them up inside that a smart, cocky, black man beat them at their own game, twice. He stopped the world economy from crashing. He eased our fears during national tragedies, and whether we liked everything about the ACA or not, he tried his best to give more people access to health care. All with a smile. Not because he was happy with the way it all played out, but because that’s what presidents are supposed to do ― act presidential.</p> <p>As president, Obama recognized that he represented all Americans, even the ones who didn’t vote for him. He recognized that he was not bigger than the office of the presidency. He knew that he owed the office a high level of respect. More importantly, though, he realized that our children were watching. A concept unfathomable to the current occupant of the Oval Office.</p> <p>President Obama recognized that generations of politicians, teachers, civic leaders, and yes, children, would take their cues from how he behaved as president. Instead of engaging in Twitter battles or attacking the character of his detractors, he gracefully ignored their criticism and stood tall against a party determined to beat HIM. He acted presidential, imagine that.</p> <p>My Republican friends should take note because what they’re supporting, either directly or indirectly, isn’t just an anti-Obama presidency but an anti-American president. Supporting a president who is uninterested, unprepared, and unwilling to learn from his mistakes isn’t just overtly political, it’s immoral. At some point, you are the company you keep.</p> <p>(Let me unapologetically digress and say that if Republicans are offended that they’re constantly being called racist by Democrats, stop palling around with racists; it’s not that complicated. If you consistently find yourself on the side of the racist, if you consistently find yourself defending racists, if you consistently find yourself making excuses for racists, you may not be a racist, but you certainly look like one. If that hurts your feelings, that’s too bad, this is me abandoning political correctness. That’s what you wanted, right?)</p> <p>There is no tax break in the world that can justify supporting a man who continues to lie to the American people with no hesitation. There’s no level that unemployment can fall to that should justify the disrespect that this man has shown to each and every one of us. The end will never justify the means, ever.</p> <p>Instead of being honest with themselves and with the American people, Republicans have chosen to be complicit and engage in a level of intellectual dishonesty, and that isn’t just disgusting, it’s dangerous.</p> <p>Deep down we all know that there is nothing about Donald Trump that is admirable. There is nothing about Donald Trump that is redeemable. He is a con-artist and a fraud. He worships at the altar of greed, lies like it’s going out of style, and sees apologizing as a sign of weakness. He is everything our parents told us not to embrace.</p> <p>At some point though, the bottom will fall out of this president’s poll numbers, taking the rest of the Republican Party with him. Not even this brand of corporate cowards can save this administration. It will be at that point and only at that point that Republicans will admit publicly what many have said to me privately, “He had no business becoming president.” A fact that has been obvious from the moment he emerged from his golden tower. A fact that privately, few Republicans deny. When that happens, let me be the first to say that there is nothing courageous about publicly coming to that conclusion.</p> <p>There is a clear difference between political courage and political expediency. The first is how Republicans should have acted during the election and the second is how they actually acted. Like a mathematician, Republicans made a calculation that party was more important than country. They decided that attempting to erase our first black president from the history books was more important than any other pressing issue.</p> <p>The more I engage with Republicans post-election, the more I realize how badly they are still reeling from their loss to President Obama in 2008. The more I realize that they are stuck in a time warp reminiscent of a 1980s movie with no path or plan to move America forward. The problem with that realization is that we’re not in a movie, this is real life and these decisions have consequences.</p> <p>If Republicans can’t figure out a way to lead, it’s time for Americans to replace them with someone who can. Someone who can restore faith in government and civility into our national dialogue. Someone respectable. Someone other than the current group of politicians who can’t get over 2008.</p></article>

But the Project Veritas exposé of a well-orchestrated strategy to smear <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> using paid thugs and Soviet-style provocations, is just beyond belief.</p> <p>Key to the strategy is a political “black operations” specialist named Scott Foval, the National Field Director for a left-wing activist group called Americans United for Change.</p> <p>In undercover video shot by Project Veritas, Foval boasts of having local operatives ready to execute campaign dirty tricks all over the country.</p> <p>“The [Clinton] campaign pays the DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes the s**t,” Foval tells the undercover reporter.</p> <p>One tactic Foval used with success was <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/17/hidden-camera-video-shows-democrats-sent-agitators-to-trump-rallies/" type="external">“bird dogging,”</a> planting activists at Trump rallies to provoke violence.

© Getty Images <p>Elections are about power: who has it, who doesn’t.</p> <p>Until this year, we were told that the candidate with the most money would win. Why? Because money buys negative ads to influence an uninformed electorate.</p> <p>Who keeps the electorate uninformed? The national media.</p> <p>When I started to work as a reporter in the early 1980s, I thought my job was to inform my readers. Somehow over the past twenty years, the job description has changed. Now it’s all about “the narrative.”</p> <p>“The narrative” is the daily spin the national media decides to put on the news. It determines what they will cover, how they will cover it — and what topics they will exile to Tinfoilia, that distant fringe world where Yahoo is not a search engine and America actually stands for something worth fighting and dying for.</p> <p>Last night, the phony journalists were all waiting. You could see and hear them on Twitter and on the blogs. When will Trump say it? And they were disappointed. At least early on.</p> <p>For the first twenty-five minutes, Trump and Hillary stayed on topic, and fought each other on policy grounds over their picks for the Supreme Court, and the life or death decisions those justices will make for generations of future Americans.</p> <p>They sparred on taxes. Hillary promised flat-out she will “tax the rich,” which in Hillary-speak means anyone earning more than minimum wage. Trump said he will lower individual tax rates, lower corporate taxes, and grow the economy.</p> <p>The media heads were drooping. Boring! Because they don’t want this election to be about policy, where the tired left-wing dogmas Hillary is spouting have been tried and failed repeatedly for generations.</p> <p>They were just waiting for Trump to say it. They would know what “it” is when they heard it.</p> <p>Hillary looked down repeatedly. A script? She seemed to have attack lines her staff had prepared. When Trump wouldn’t take the bait, she tried another. The media held its breath. Will he bite this time? Will he go off the rails?</p> <p>Because that is the narrative. It’s all about Trump’s character, his “unfitness” for office. That is the narrative Hillary and her campaign gurus in the media have decided to push, because they don’t have anything better.</p> <p>Finally, Chris Wallace — who ought to be shot for keeping the candidates on substantive topics — asks Trump if he will accept the result of the election. And Trump won’t say the words.</p> <p>Now the phony journalists wake up. There it is, like the response in catechism class (okay, none of them has gone to catechism class). And he won’t say it. He won’t say that he will accept the results of a phony, rigged election.</p> <p>Suddenly, they have their “gotcha” moment.</p> <p>Never-Trumper Ben Shapiro was tweeting, and he caught it immediately:</p> <p>At exactly 10:17 PM eastern time – fifteen minutes before the end of the debate – CBS News, Reuters, USA Today, CNN and the BBC <a href="https://twitter.com/jbenton/status/788927389308887040" type="external">issued their writ</a> for tomorrow’s headlines: “When asked if he will accept the results of the election, <a type="internal">Donald Trump</a> says ‘I will look at it at the time.’”</p> <p>And then something horrifying happened.</p> <p>No, it wasn’t Hillary’s phony horror that somehow Donald Trump would set off a remake of Bush v. Gore in an evenly divided Supreme Court come November. Nor was it visions of street fighting and riots.</p> <p>Donald Trump started calling them out. He told the truth about our rigged elections.</p> <p>“First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing,” he said. “It’s so dishonest. And they’ve poisoned the mind of the voters.”</p> <p>And then he used the live cameras, and in front of tens of millions of Americans, he delivered the news — the real news that the media has refused to cover during the campaign.</p> <p>He told America about our rotten election system, the millions of dead voters who have been put back on the voter rolls. Why? So the Democrats can <a href="http://www.electionlawcenter.com/uncategorized/dead-men-voting-who-are-they-casting-their-ballots-for/" type="external">get the tombstone vote</a>.</p> <p>He told Americans about the “millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn’t be registered to vote.” Oh yes, Virginia. <a href="http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/virginia-voter-fraud-thousands-illegal-aliens-registered-vote/" type="external">That means you</a>.</p> <p>Voter fraud cases are finally being investigated in <a href="http://www.electionlawcenter.com" type="external">dozens of states</a>, and the phony media continues to pretend, “there is <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/10/19/trump_campaign_keeps_pushing_debunked_evidence_of_voter_fraud_it_s_working.html" type="external">no such thing</a> as voter fraud.”</p> <p>Trump even mentioned the James O’Keefe <a type="internal">Project Veritas videos</a> that captured on camera Democrat party operatives boasting about their dirty tricks campaigns, including massive coordinated voter fraud schemes.</p> <p>Donald Trump wants this election to be about truth. The media would like it to be about illusions. (Even Alan Schulkin, the Democrat commissioner of the New York City Board of Elections, <a href="http://www.jokpeme.com/2016/10/they-bus-people-around-hidden-camera.html" type="external">has admitted</a> that Democrat operatives “bus people around to vote” and supports a photo ID requirement to prevent rampant voter fraud).</p> <p>The ease with which ineligible voters can cast ballots in America, robbing legitimate voters of their voice, make elections in many Third World countries look good. And that’s a disgrace.</p> <p>Here’s the real headline the phony journalists don’t want you to read: Americans are waking up the horror show. And the media is aghast. Because if Donald Trump wins in November, they will stand along with Hillary and Emperor Obama, exposed, cold and naked before the truth.</p> <p>And that is truly horrifying to them.</p> <p>Timmerman is a Donald Trump supporter.

	<article id="0001240" published-at="2016-10-31" title="Duty-bound: Donor explains why Trump deserves support over Clinton"><p>This has been a particularly vicious election season, with <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> slinging mud at Donald Trump in an immoral attempt to distract the American public from her many failures.</p> <p>Hillary says Mr. Trump is destroying our country and a racist anti-Semite. On the contrary, Mr. Trump is making our country stronger by continuing to stand for the values and ideals that we have always held sacrosanct.</p> <p>Well, I can tell you as a Jewish Republican that this is simply not true. Those attacking Mr. Trump — like Hillary — just don’t have the same values as myself and Mr. Trump: values such as free speech, protecting our country from disruptive forces and allying strongly with Israel — the sole democracy in the Middle East.</p> <p>But Hillary clearly looks down on democracy; if elected, she would ensure we never have a fair election in this country again. Just like her husband, Hillary has a deplorable track record.</p> <p>If Hillary were to become president, you could say goodbye to free speech. She harangues Mr. Trump for speaking his mind and for being genuine. But that is why we need him. We need someone to lead our country who is unafraid to speak his mind, calling out the faux leadership we’ve seen in the past eight years.</p> <p>Hillary has shown that she stands against the Bill of Rights, a document representing everything our country stands for. Hillary says she’s for free speech, but this is a clear lie. She does everything in her power to quiet those who disagree with her.</p> <p>She calls Mr. Trump a racist despite the fact that she supports the racist Black Lives Matter movement. She is a disciple of Marxist Saul Alinsky and anti-American George Soros, two men committed to destroying our country to turn it into a Communist Utopia.</p> <p>Incapable of maintaining free speech, she somehow also fails in one of the few arenas in which free speech is not protected. Her wanton abuse of government protocol proves that she is not qualified for the security clearances that come with being secretary of state — let alone president.</p> <p>Hillary has stood behind the United Nations — an entity known to be anti-United States and anti-Israel — as it has espoused dangerous rhetoric. She supported the Organization of the Islamic Conference’s resolution to weed out discrimination and hate speech against Muslims, yet has done nothing to combat the growing anti-Semitism in our country and the world.</p> <p>Mr. Trump is the only person willing to call things what they are and to stand up to “politically correct” bullies like the U.N., who are slowly dismantling the United States and Israel.</p> <p>Hillary refuses to show any political friendship to Israel, refusing to accept Israel’s right to control Jerusalem during her tenure in the State Department.</p> <p>Mr. Trump is the first major candidate to offer real immigration reform. He is the only candidate who will protect Christians from the worldwide persecution they face and root out the anti-Semitism that has been choking the globe. Mr. Trump will restore credibility to U.S. foreign policy as a strong commander-in-chief.</p> <p>Hillary can’t do this. She has already shown that she is beholding to political Islam entities.</p> <p>Not only does she want to open our borders to everyone, but she wants our country to mirror the Islamist countries she so ardently supports. Hillary supported a deal that provided $150 billion to Iran — a material support of terrorism. This isn’t just immoral — it’s illegal.</p> <p>Her support of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Libya and Syria supports the war on women. Hillary says Mr. Trump disrespects women; her political allies abuse, torture, jail and oppress women.</p> <p>Her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya resulted in the deaths of four Americans. Due to her refusal to reinforce protection or send in military forces to protect the U.S. ambassador to Libya and consulate employees, Hillary is directly responsible for these deaths.</p> <p>Does she believe in the Islamist regime of terror? She believes in her bank account. She has sold favors to our enemies in exchange for Clinton Foundation funding. In return, she allows them carte blanche to invade other countries and continue to fund terrorism worldwide.</p> <p>And her vice presidential pick is no better, showing that when she succumbs to her health issues, he will maintain her status quo of criminality.</p> <p>The future of Western Civilization is at grave risk if a non-believer like Hillary wins. It is our duty as, not just Jews and Republicans, but as Americans to ensure Mr. Trump is elected to keep our country and way of life safe.</p> <p>Abramowitz is a general partner and co-founder at NGN Capital.

Now we know that, at the same time, Brazile at CNN was proving her Clinton loyalist bona fides by abusing the system and rigging the game to bolster Clinton over Sanders.</p> <p>The DNC must have been laughing themselves silly over the fast one they were pulling to elevate Brazile, who was putatively objective when it came to Democratic primary contenders, to dispose of Wasserman-Schultz’s double dealing.

	<article id="0001242" published-at="2016-11-02" title="Pardon me: The Hillary scandals are just getting started">
© Getty Images <p>If you think you have scandal fatigue now, just wait. Should <a type="internal">Hillary Clinton</a> win the presidency on Nov. 8, you can expect an endless stream of Hillary scandals, even if President Obama issues a pre-emptive pardon for her before the election.</p> <p>Yes, the president has the power to issue pardons before an offender has been charged with a crime. That precedent was established when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/07/preemptive_presidential_pardons.html" type="external">ruled in 1866</a> that a presidential pardon "extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment."</p> <p>Discussion of the Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=71&amp;invol=333" type="external">Ex parte Garland</a> sprouted up on Democrat-leaning websites and blogs at the end of the Bush 43 presidency, when the liberal establishment <a href="http://www.democrats.com/torturers-demand-pardons-from-bush" type="external">convinced itself</a> that only by pardoning intelligence officials involved in extraordinary renditions and the enhanced interrogation of terrorists could they escape jail sentences.</p> <p>Of course, President George W. Bush didn’t need to pardon torturers, because U.S. intelligence officials had not committed torture. Rather, they had acted within a set of strict constitutional guidelines set out by then Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo (derisively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_Memos" type="external">referred to by Wikipedia</a> as the “Torture Memos”).</p> <p>But while a presidential pardon might avoid the sorry spectacle of a national security investigation by the FBI of an incoming president for her reckless mishandling of classified information while secretary of State, it would in no way deter Republicans in Congress from conducting their own investigations of Mrs. Clinton, up to and including impeachment proceedings.</p> <p>For example, we now know that <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/laptop-may-include-thousands-of-emails-linked-to-hillary-clintons-private-server-1477854957" type="external">four separate FBI field offices have been conducting a corruption investigation</a> of the Clinton Foundation for well over a year.</p> <p>Imagine for a moment how Congress would react if Obama were to pardon Mrs. Clinton not just for her email woes but for her past corruption, even for corruption not yet discovered? Do you really think Republicans, even if they were in the minority, would let that one go?</p> <p>I recall the tenacity of Rep. Henry González, a long-time Democrat back-bencher from Texas who rose to become chairman of the House Banking Committee in 1989. González used all the wiles of his congressional office to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_B._Gonzalez" type="external">prosecute President George H.W. Bush</a> for arming Saddam Hussein in the lead-up to the first Gulf War.</p> <p>González was so successful in his efforts that they contributed to <a type="internal">Bill Clinton</a>’s 1992 victory over an incumbent president who, at his peak, had a 90 percent approval rating.</p> <p>Here are just a few of the Hillary scandals Congress could pursue:</p> <p>• The Loretta Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac of the Phoenix airport, just as the FBI was getting ready to make public its conclusions on the Hillary Clinton private email server. Did Bill Clinton promise Lynch that Hillary, if elected president, would reappoint her as Attorney General?</p> <p>• Pay for play at the Clinton Foundation. I can imagine several committee chairmen exploring <a type="internal">whether the actions of the Clinton Foundation violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).</a> While a presidential pardon might clear Mrs. Clinton of RICO charges, it wouldn’t cover Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, Doug Band, Huma Abedin, or a host of other Clinton Foundation officials who solicited donations from foreign corporations and foreign governments in exchange for official favors while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State.</p> <p>Will they all go to the mat (or jail) to protect Mrs. Clinton and her scandal-plagued presidency?</p> <p>Pay-to-play schemes that violated RICO could lead to multiple federal prosecutions to disgorge illicit profits through civil forfeiture proceedings. Imagine the Clinton Foundation having to repay the Governments of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Algeria and Qatar tens of millions of dollars for having essentially traded payoffs for U.S. government favors or for the promise of favors to come?</p> <p>What about the Varkey Foundation and its GEMS education initiative, which paid Bill Clinton more than $56 million to serve as front man for a gigantic fund-raising scheme? “Upon funding and implementation, these commitments will have a total value of over $70 billion,” the <a href="https://www.varkeyfoundation.org/partners/clinton" type="external">foundation website</a> boasts.</p> <p>Are they waiting for Mrs. Clinton to be sworn into office before those “commitments” can be banked? Are donors expecting future favors from a Clinton administration in return for their money? I can’t imagine Congress not wanting to know answers to those questions.</p> <p>Or what about contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative <a href="https://www.1776channel.com/2016/10/05/national-security/jafars-abraaj-group-paid-clinton-foundation-jafars-rewarded-port-canaveral-gulftainer-deal/" type="external">from the Abraaj Group</a>, a UAE private equity company partly-owned by the family of Jaafar Dhia Jaafar, the mastermind of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear weapons program? Congressional investigators will want to know if those donations influenced a decision made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to award the Abraaj Group hundreds of millions of dollars in investment management contracts through the State Department’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation.</p> <p>• Illegal coordination between Hillary’s presidential campaign, her super Pac, and the Democratic National Committee. Allegations of illegal collusion stemmed from undercover video shot by Project Veritas that captured DNC self-styled “undercover” operatives boasting of <a type="internal">carrying out dirty tricks</a> in coordination with the Clinton presidential campaign. Congress will want to hear testimony from the DNC operatives, and will undoubtedly demand that the DNC provide financial records detailing their relationship to these “consultants.”</p> <p>• The Iran nuclear deal. Congress will surely want to investigate Mrs. Clinton’s role in establishing a secret back-channel with Iran that led to the worst diplomatic deal in U.S. history, a deal that rewarded a terrorist and terror-sponsor regime with $150 billion and a sure path to nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Did Mrs. Clinton meet with Iranian officials or regime intermediaries before official talks began? Did she make promises to Clinton Foundation donors that she would “open up” Iran for U.S. business once she became president?</p> <p>Oh, the scandals will be rich, and they will be unending. And they are all of the Clintons’ making. They will not only further weaken our hand in foreign relations, but will distract us from what needs to be done domestically to make this country great again.</p> <p>Is that what you want, America?</p> <p>The views of Contributors are their own and are not the views of The Hill.</p></article>

And what that declassified document showed was that the Fourth Amendment rights of numerous American citizens were violated during the last year of <a type="internal">Obama</a>’s administration.</p> <p>And even more specifically: the violations dealt with Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the part that mandates feds who are spying for justifiable reasons to take extra care to safeguard information on citizen information that’s inadvertently collected. These protections are aimed at upholding the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans, the ones that guarantee citizens will be secure in their persons and possessions and kept free of unreasonable and warrantless searches.</p> <p>Apparently, <a type="internal">Obama</a>’s intel didn’t follow proper procedure.</p> <p>Judge Rosemary Collyer, <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/icotr/51117/2016_Cert_FISC_Memo_Opin_Order_Apr_2017.pdf" type="external">writing</a> the opinion for the FISC, called the cavalier treatment with which Team <a type="internal">Obama</a> handled Section 702 data a “very serious Fourth Amendment issue.” Collyer also dinged <a type="internal">Obama</a>’s National Security Agency for an “institutional lack of candor,” and the FBI for passing along “raw FISA information” to even those agents and officials who didn’t need access.</p> <p>Trump’s put a stop to such cavalier handling of intel — at least, according to the court.</p> <p>Once again, it’s a case of Democrats talking the talk — paying lip service to something as crucial as the Fourth Amendment — but failing to walk the walk. And the media?</p> <p>Well, all media eyes are turned toward Russia right now, looking for the latest bit of innuendo that might be spun as proof positive of a President Trump collusion with Vladimir Putin.

Earlier, we reported that he slammed Americans as <a type="internal">lazy, ignorant racists</a> while in Laos. But it’s much worse than that. On Friday, <a href="https://news.grabien.com/story.php?id=482" type="external">Grabien</a> posted a montage of 18 statements Obama made trashing America during his most recent trip to China and Laos.</p> <p>Here’s the list Grabien posted:</p> There are still too many poor children in the United States Too many children in America are not getting enough to eat Despite America’s wealth, we’re not providing sufficient educational resources in poor communities America lacks the “political will” to help poor inner cities that have suffered discrimination. Americans are “lazy” in thinking we don’t need to learn about foreign nations. Colin Kapernack is justified protesting the National Anthem, as the NFL star is raising “real, legitimate issues” about things America needs to be talked about. America suffers from racism, conflicts between ethnic groups, and discrimination against immigrants. Criticisms of America being imperfect and having problems with racism discrimination are accurate. America still has “situations where women are not treated equally.” America “didn’t think through” our policy in Vietnam War, as dropping cluster bombs proved counterproductive to “winning hearts and minds.” America’s treatment of Native Americans was “tragic.” America “struggled to stay true” to our founding ideal that all men are created equal. When the environment is destroyed in America, it’s because the private sector is being “lazy.” The United States is still to this day learning how to develop industry without destroying the environment. Due to industrialization, America “used to have terrible pollution … everywhere.” America’s role in the Vietnam war led to mass displacement of people from their homes. America dropped more bombs on Laos than on Germany and Japan during World War II … more than 2 million bombs … “the bombs fell like rain.” More bombs, he said on several occasions, were dropped on Laos per capita than anywhere else in the world. We bombed the “simple homes” of civilians in Laos. “Villages and entire allies were obliterated.” The ancient Plain of Jars “was devastated.” Countless civilians were killed. <p>Here’s the video:</p> <p>Maybe one day, we’ll have a president who actually loves this country…</p> <p>Trending: <a type="internal">Jacksonville shooting suspect David Katz believed to be member of anti-Trump ‘resistance’</a></p> <p>Related:</p> <a href="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=CMbqWOE-FW5TnEIbRpgP1zrmQBpWboo5TzvyJk9YHg5n0_QgQASCMm4QiYMkGoAGGuKr7AsgBAagDAcgDywSqBPMBT9AnIe1Y1TygMbVQEZBRPmptZkGrWQd0T02qvewkDmkT_29t4kQ-ePN293A2rHR9yw1qdzT3QJBqXPTnxAIyUe22PRj6khlI9uUFwcM_cJHSvUpXSMQG2TCjgeZs-RuY-gvxeWMIHmjYSazSvzUajE0XBGQFAlh6LtapK7wh2P9eZUum5SSZb2an95MYzbj017wHW9xQsnyRMws7_bux41xWypACbUR9_dCBjuzWhfkKd9316TkoDYeutqr7yPkzLM8YRgmtecsK4WlqkcCWfTkgIqeHK4pdJaJq4IU3SXArHRaSNLmJvS3piKNz0niIFGv4gAfix9WEAagHjs4bqAfVyRuoB6gGqAfZyxuoB8_MG6gHpr4bqAeYzhuoB5oG2AcB0ggHCIBhEAEYAfIIG2FkeC1zdWJzeW4tMTYwNzc3MzI1NDA3MjQyMbEJQhQm8GIymVaACgPYEwOIFAE&amp;num=1&amp;sig=AOD64_1QkZXfPErCeY8EPyInw5rf235a_g&amp;client=ca-pub-2322157869609449&amp;adurl=https://go.seafoamsales.com/advance-sale" type="external"/> <a href="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=CMbqWOE-FW5TnEIbRpgP1zrmQBpWboo5TzvyJk9YHg5n0_QgQASCMm4QiYMkGoAGGuKr7AsgBAagDAcgDywSqBPMBT9AnIe1Y1TygMbVQEZBRPmptZkGrWQd0T02qvewkDmkT_29t4kQ-ePN293A2rHR9yw1qdzT3QJBqXPTnxAIyUe22PRj6khlI9uUFwcM_cJHSvUpXSMQG2TCjgeZs-RuY-gvxeWMIHmjYSazSvzUajE0XBGQFAlh6LtapK7wh2P9eZUum5SSZb2an95MYzbj017wHW9xQsnyRMws7_bux41xWypACbUR9_dCBjuzWhfkKd9316TkoDYeutqr7yPkzLM8YRgmtecsK4WlqkcCWfTkgIqeHK4pdJaJq4IU3SXArHRaSNLmJvS3piKNz0niIFGv4gAfix9WEAagHjs4bqAfVyRuoB6gGqAfZyxuoB8_MG6gHpr4bqAeYzhuoB5oG2AcB0ggHCIBhEAEYAfIIG2FkeC1zdWJzeW4tMTYwNzc3MzI1NDA3MjQyMbEJQhQm8GIymVaACgPYEwOIFAE&amp;num=1&amp;sig=AOD64_1QkZXfPErCeY8EPyInw5rf235a_g&amp;client=ca-pub-2322157869609449&amp;adurl=https://go.seafoamsales.com/advance-sale" type="external">Sea Foam on sale now</a> <a href="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=CMbqWOE-FW5TnEIbRpgP1zrmQBpWboo5TzvyJk9YHg5n0_QgQASCMm4QiYMkGoAGGuKr7AsgBAagDAcgDywSqBPMBT9AnIe1Y1TygMbVQEZBRPmptZkGrWQd0T02qvewkDmkT_29t4kQ-ePN293A2rHR9yw1qdzT3QJBqXPTnxAIyUe22PRj6khlI9uUFwcM_cJHSvUpXSMQG2TCjgeZs-RuY-gvxeWMIHmjYSazSvzUajE0XBGQFAlh6LtapK7wh2P9eZUum5SSZb2an95MYzbj017wHW9xQsnyRMws7_bux41xWypACbUR9_dCBjuzWhfkKd9316TkoDYeutqr7yPkzLM8YRgmtecsK4WlqkcCWfTkgIqeHK4pdJaJq4IU3SXArHRaSNLmJvS3piKNz0niIFGv4gAfix9WEAagHjs4bqAfVyRuoB6gGqAfZyxuoB8_MG6gHpr4bqAeYzhuoB5oG2AcB0ggHCIBhEAEYAfIIG2FkeC1zdWJzeW4tMTYwNzc3MzI1NDA3MjQyMbEJQhQm8GIymVaACgPYEwOIFAE&amp;num=1&amp;sig=AOD64_1QkZXfPErCeY8EPyInw5rf235a_g&amp;client=ca-pub-2322157869609449&amp;adurl=https://go.seafoamsales.com/advance-sale" type="external">Advance Auto Parts</a> <a href="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=CMbqWOE-FW5TnEIbRpgP1zrmQBpWboo5TzvyJk9YHg5n0_QgQASCMm4QiYMkGoAGGuKr7AsgBAagDAcgDywSqBPMBT9AnIe1Y1TygMbVQEZBRPmptZkGrWQd0T02qvewkDmkT_29t4kQ-ePN293A2rHR9yw1qdzT3QJBqXPTnxAIyUe22PRj6khlI9uUFwcM_cJHSvUpXSMQG2TCjgeZs-RuY-gvxeWMIHmjYSazSvzUajE0XBGQFAlh6LtapK7wh2P9eZUum5SSZb2an95MYzbj017wHW9xQsnyRMws7_bux41xWypACbUR9_dCBjuzWhfkKd9316TkoDYeutqr7yPkzLM8YRgmtecsK4WlqkcCWfTkgIqeHK4pdJaJq4IU3SXArHRaSNLmJvS3piKNz0niIFGv4gAfix9WEAagHjs4bqAfVyRuoB6gGqAfZyxuoB8_MG6gHpr4bqAeYzhuoB5oG2AcB0ggHCIBhEAEYAfIIG2FkeC1zdWJzeW4tMTYwNzc3MzI1NDA3MjQyMbEJQhQm8GIymVaACgPYEwOIFAE&amp;num=1&amp;sig=AOD64_1QkZXfPErCeY8EPyInw5rf235a_g&amp;client=ca-pub-2322157869609449&amp;adurl=https://go.seafoamsales.com/advance-sale" type="external">Sea Foam on sale now at Advance Auto Parts.

	<article id="0001246" published-at="2017-09-28" title="Should President Trump be able to pull NBC News’ license?"><a type="internal">Share</a> Screen shot from Washington Post's YouTube video: ‘Frankly disgusting’: Trump blasts news media <p>As seen in the tweet below, President Trump has suggested he will be looking into the licensing of NBC News for what he calls their “fake news” reports. He is specifically talking about NBC News’ report on a meeting this past summer where it is reported that President Trump asked the military for a tenfold increase to our nuclear weapons arsenal.</p> <q> <p>With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!</p> <p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918112884630093825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">October 11, 2017</a></p> </q> <p>This is far from the first time the president has taken issue with the media. He frequently calls reports that paint him in a negative light “fake news.” But with his tweet this morning, he has upped the ante with his war with the media. The accuracy of the story is not what this debate is about. It is about whether President Trump should be able to pull NBC News’ license.</p> <p>Those who think he should be able to pull NBC News’ license point to the fact that many news outlets have often distorted what the president has said or done. They see these news outlets, like NBC News, as supporting a political agenda against the president and that their false reporting is hurting the country. They feel that the president is an honest man and these media reports are made to make him appear dishonest. They point out that the reports are filled with anonymous sources and so, they can’t be true, but made up to discredit the president.</p> <p>To the people who do not think he should be able to pull their license, this is a First Amendment issue. Freedom of the press and free speech can’t be suppressed by the government. If the president were allowed to do that, then we would be well on our way to living in a fascist country. The president shutting down media outlets he does not like is how we end up with government-controlled media.</p> <p>With the president’s tweet this morning, he again brings attention back to his war with the media. He has been using the term “fake news” for some time now. Many of the president’s supporters see the media as pushing a far left agenda and bent on destroying the president. Others see the media as the last line of defense against what they see as an administration more and more out of control.</p> <p>Here is a Washington Post video of President Trump talking about the NBC News story on our nuclear arsenal:</p> The Issue <p>Should the president be able to pull the license of NBC News? Has NBC News been pushing a false, left-wing agenda bent on destroying the president? Or, is the president dangerously close to attempting to destroy the First Amendment?</p> Yes, President Trump should be able to pull NBC News’ license <p>Those who support the president feel NBC News and other media outlets are pushing a false narrative that is hurting the country.

	<article id="0001247" published-at="2017-10-04" title="Stephen Paddock Had Explosives, Bomb-Making Materials; Attn, Gun Control Idiots"><a type="internal"/> <a type="internal"/> <p>Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock had a lot of explosive material and the ability to build bombs, which he was apparently planning to do. This is important evidence that gun control doesn’t work and wouldn’t have with him because, as many of my Twitter followers pointed out, those who are faced with strict gun control usually resort to bombs and running people over with vehicles. It’s also more proof that Paddock took his cue from Islamic terrorists.</p> <p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/las-vegas-suspect-likely-used-automatic-rifle-in-massacre-1506966716" type="external">Wall Street Journal</a> reported:</p> <q> <p>Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said they also found Tannerite, an explosive that detonates when shot by bullets. . . .</p> </q> <p>That was in Paddock’s Mandalay Bay hotel room. But there’s more:</p> <q> <p>In Paddock’s car, authorities found more ammunition and ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used to make explosives, Mr. Lombardo said.</p> </q> <p>Ammonium nitrate is easily obtained. You can buy it on the net from purveyors like Alibaba. These kinds of explosive materials are hallmarks of Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other Islamic terrorist groups who provide shopping lists and how-to videos on how to build bomb devices. They are not the hallmarks of someone who is “just crazy.” Or someone who has heavy gambling debts (and we’ve yet to see any evidence that Paddock had any gambling debts, just info that he was a high-stakes gambler, which is not the same as losing and owing).</p> <p>So, what was Paddock planning to bomb? Or was he keeping that stuff in his car in case his plan with hotel windows and the automatic guns didn’t work? That appears likely. If he was refused entry into the hotel or not allowed to take his guns and ammo in–had they been detected (which they weren’t), he could’ve set off bombs in the venue.</p> <p>And, again, this is a memo to the two Jidiot Jimmys–Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon–and all of the other gun-grabbing, statist, gun control freaks: when guns are taken away from criminals and terrorists, they a) go to the black market where they easily obtain them; or b) turn to other methods of mass murder that can arguably be more dangerous and more effective, including bombs and other explosive devices to blow people up and vehicles to mow people down.</p> <p>How much you wanna bet Stephen Paddock got instructions from Muslims on how to build a bomb using ammonium nitrate? Don’t bet against it.</p></article>

	<article id="0001250" published-at="2017-10-30" title="Will Anything Happen November 4th?">
Antifa is calling for a peaceful protest every day starting November 4th, but others are saying online that Antifa is calling for an all-out violent war in the streets. Still others are saying plainly that Antifa is planning to instigate a civil war in order to remove Trump from the White House. <p><a href="https://dailycaller.com/" type="external">Dailycaller.com</a> reports: Antifa websites like Going Down, Sub.Media, and Insurrection News have been promoting the group, which calls itself the Revolutionary Abolitionist Movement (RAM). The press release the group published is filled with far-fetched claims about how “mosques are being ruthlessly bombed” and how “LGBTQ are being battered.” RAM cites, with pride, cop killers like Mumia Abu Jamal who shot and killed a police officer in Philadelphia in 1981 and Russell Shoats who shot a police officer in the back five times in 1970.</p> <p>RAM is calling for the abolition of gender and the expropriation of private property to begin the revolutionary process. Far Left Watch notes that RAM has been hosting anti-police workshops, a class on anarchism, and a class called ‘Our Enemies in Blue’.</p> <p>Antifa and Refuse Fascism are front groups for the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). The RCP has and is calling for the overt overthrow of the government of the United States. Many of these groups are being funded by George Soros. Anti-fascist groups in the United States have their genesis in communist groups across Europe. Just about everyone who was not a follower of communism was identified as ‘fascist’. As today, a non-communist is now considered a fascist.</p> <p>Despite calls for violence and violent clashes with Trump supporters. The main stream media has been very lenient with Antifa, calling them crusaders against white supremacy and racism. They naively or purposely have enabled and promoted violent communists by taking Antifa at face value while concealing their real agenda. California Governor Jerry Brown recently said about President Trump, “I hope the rest of the world does their part in providing a powerful opposition.” It is this kind of inciteful rhetoric that encourages these groups to violence.</p> <p>It is hard to speculate on what may or may not happen. This could very well be a nothing burger, or as dangerous as some think. To completely ignore it would be foolish.</p> insert picture insert picture CNN Hopes You Never See This Hillary Video</article>

insert picture <p>Sen. Rand Paul has returned to work on Capitol Hill after a Trump-hating, Bernie Sanders-supporting, left-wing Democrat put him in the hospital after what looks like a politically motivated attack.</p> <p>The junior Republican senator from Kentucky returned to Washington Monday in time for the Senate Finance Committee to begin considering the Senate tax reform bill, which is now said to include a provision repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate, as Paul has long proposed.</p> <p>The afternoon of Friday, Nov. 3, Rene Albert Boucher, 59, ambushed 54-year-old Paul, his next-door neighbor of 17 years, at his home, crushing Paul’s ribs while the senator was performing yard work. A registered Democrat, Boucher has practiced as an anesthesiologist in Bowling Green. Paul is an ophthalmologist. Boucher has entered a not guilty plea to a misdemeanor fourth-degree assault charge.</p> <p>“From my perspective, I’m not really too concerned about what someone’s motive is,” Paul said.</p> <p>“I’m just concerned that I was attacked from the back and somebody broke six of my ribs and gave me a damaged lung where at least for now I have trouble speaking and breathing and now I’ve hurt for 10 days.”</p> <p>There was “no justification” for the attack, Paul told the Washington Examiner this week.</p> <p>Senior Paul adviser Doug Stafford said separately that Paul and Boucher hadn’t spoken for years before the incident. “This was not a ‘fight,’ it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person,” Stafford said in a statement. “Anyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention.”</p> <p>This is Paul’s second reported brush with political violence this year.</p> <p>Paul was playing in the congressional baseball practice game in a Washington suburb in June when Trump-hating Bernie Sanders supporter James T. Hodgkinson opened fire wounding four and coming close to assassinating House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) who survived his life-threatening injuries.

insert picture <p>In the 1960s, overtly communist agitators came up with an effective strategy for dividing Americans: they attacked veterans returning from the Vietnam War. They mercilessly targeted men who had the least power in society: those who lacked the resources to avoid the draft through political connections or college enrollment. Following Saul Alinsky’s hateful playbook, they targeted, isolated, and demonized young men coming home who had just been through the hell of war.</p> <p>The strategy paid off in great whopping dividends of social division and discord. It also did nothing to convince ordinary Americans or elected officials of the need to stop the war: instead, it weakened the rest of the anti-war movement.</p> <p>But here is the important part, the part nobody remembers now: ending the war didn’t matter to the communist agitators who screamed at legless 21-year olds returning from Saigon. It didn’t matter because those agitators were not anti-war: they were pro-communist warmongers rooting for communist victory abroad and at home.</p> <p>This important history is now willfully denied. Mere mocking is enough to shut down discussion of it in the worlds of education, the media, and politics. Even conservative pundits and politicians dumbly grandstand against “McCarthyism,” as if there never was a real and powerful communist movement in America, let alone one now.</p> <p>Mocking the idea that communist agitation in America was and is real has become even more fashionable of late, just as communist Antifa thugs and their useful idiots in academia riot on the streets and shut down free speech on college campuses – and Google campuses, and everywhere else suppression of thought is deemed a special priority of the human resources battalion.</p> <p>(Editor’s note: <a href="https://www.bombthrowers.com/article/movie-now-live-america-under-siege-antifa/" type="external">America Under Siege: Antifa</a>, is now available for viewing online. The documentary film headlined by renowned radicalism expert Trevor Loudon, is a production of Dangerous Documentaries, which, like Bombthrowers, is a project of Capital Research Center.)</p> <p>Such mass denial feels like a psychological phenomenon, but underlying it now (unlike in the Sixties) is a completely rational fear: fear of losing one’s job for saying the wrong thing, or losing one’s grade point average because the hag teaching you Revolutionary College Composition has sniffed out your carefully concealed resistance to her ideology, thereby jeopardizing your chance at having a career or supporting a family or all the other things that make a nation survive.</p> <p>This strategy of the communist thugs has never wavered because it works: divide ordinary, non-political Americans against each other by “occupying” a beloved institution or public property with confrontational (but disguised) communist tactics. Make sure nobody can escape your politics, not in pre-school or college or at work, or when they’re in their own homes settling in to watch TV. Count on the <a href="https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D07E0DB123BE433A25757C2A9609C946094D6CF&amp;legacy=true" type="external">New York Times</a> or the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/opinion/why-women-had-better-sex-under-socialism.html?mcubz=0&amp;_r=0" type="external">New York Times</a> and Hollywood to carry your water (or Gatorade).</p> <p>Hold people hostage until they give in and give you things, in the entirely vain hope you will go away.</p> <p>We are witnessing this strategy being played out in the national football and basketball leagues, where useful idiots “take a knee,” allegedly to protest non-existent “racist police brutality,” but actually to lash out at all police, and white people, and Americans. Like the soldiers coming home from Vietnam, it is the courageous men (and women) serving in uniform who are the overt targets of the agitator’s bullets and rage, but all Americans of all races are trapped in the agitators’ cultural crosshairs.</p> <p>“Taking a knee” is just the latest iteration of “Occupy Wall Street” or “Black Lives Matter” or any of the other countless stupidity parades disrupting college campuses. Countless more useful idiots join in by virtue-signaling their support for professional agitators whose real goals have nothing to do with “peace” or “equality” or “bullying” or understanding the historical pain of minorities or, as so many columnists are bleating now, “free speech.”</p> <p>If we had honest academicians in the universities teaching the real history of domestic communist agitation, maybe we wouldn’t be so universally gormless in the face of this now. Maybe we would stop ceding public property and public treasure – our universities and job opportunities, and real free speech – to the communist agitators this time.</p> CNN Hopes You Never See This Hillary Video</article>

This is what hate looks like: Hayley Geftman-Gold <p>There was a time not so very long ago when a national tragedy would unite the country, if only for a short time. We would grieve the humans lost as humans lost, innocent people taken too soon with loved ones left behind. In the wake of the <a href="http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/las-vegas-massacre-58-dead-500-wounded-lone-shooter" type="external">Las Vegas shooting</a>, it is all too clear that those days are gone.</p> <p>Hayley Geftman-Gold, a top legal executive at CBS, is one of those people on whose humanity we cannot rely. As <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2017/10/02/cbs-legal-exec-no-sympathy-because-country-music-fans-often-are-republican/" type="external">The Daily Caller</a> reports, she posted on Facebook “If they wouldn’t do anything when children were murdered” — presumably a reference to the Sandy Hook shooting — “have no hope that Repugs will ever do the right thing. I’m actually not even sympathetic bc country music fans often are Republican gun toters.”</p> <p>Geftman-Gold, according to her profile, went to Columbia Law school, and now holds the position of VP, Senior Counsel, Strategic Transactions, at CBS. This is a highly-educated woman with a prestigious position saying that she doesn’t care that people are dead because of their political affiliation. This is not a radical political affiliation, one that calls for murder or violence. It is a mainstream political opinion held by roughly half of the country.</p> <p>Editor’s update: CBS Corp. has fired Geftman-Gold for the now-deleted tweet, according to <a href="https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/cbs-exec-fired-after-dissing-vegas-shooting-victims/" type="external">LifeZette:</a></p> <q> <p>“This individual, who was with us for approximately one year, violated the standards of our company and is no longer an employee of CBS,” the network. “Her views as expressed on social media are deeply unacceptable to all of us at CBS. Our hearts go out to the victims in Las Vegas and their families.”</p> </q> <p>Other comments said “imagine the coverage if this was a Muslim guy?” (Well, the coverage is wall-to-wall and we don’t know his religion right now) to which someone replied “of course.

TV “personality” Piers Morgan tweeted “If the shooter was Muslim, we’d call this a terrorist attack. This was a terrorist attack, committed by a 64 year-old white American. #Vegas” No, Mr. Morgan, we would not.

	<article id="0001254" published-at="2017-10-09" title="Sighting Down On The Second Amendment"><a href="http://whatfinger.com/" type="external"/> insert picture <p>Before a people are enslaved, before any nation is taken over, they are first disarmed. That’s just history and common sense. From the inside or out, a nation is always first compromised by the removal of its ability to defend itself. Stalin, Hitler, Mao, et al., they all declawed whatever organism that stood in their way - most especially the people they intended to govern.</p> <p>When Japan was planning to attack our mainland, their Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto purportedly said that attacking America would be like attacking a sleeping giant - and it is commonly claimed that he warned there would be a gun waiting for them ‘behind every blade of grass’ - indeed, a very reasonable statement. I find it fascinating that online liberal ‘fact checking’ sites adamantly insist that the quote is “bogus”. Further, they go on to say that gun rights activists often haul up that quote in order to drive home an argument for gun ownership - as though simply expressing that concept in such a context were evil.</p> Gun ownership is entirely about self defense <p>The argument for unfettered gun ownership comes naturally, supports itself, and is entirely righteous.</p> <p>Every year in this nation, medical malpractice takes more lives than do guns. It is estimated that between 800,000 to 2,000,000 deaths are prevented annually by guns - both in the hands of law enforcement as well as individual gun owners. Guns, in and of themselves, pose no threat to anyone but are regularly vilified by professional politicians who won’t themselves give up their own guns or the guns of their hired protection.</p> <p>The Second Amendment of the Constitution guaranteeing every American citizen’s right to arm himself with firepower was considered to be the second most important right by the framers - preceded only by our right to express the opinions we hold as sacred and defendable. It is not surprising that both those amendments are the most hated by the liberal left and its partnering spokespeople the liberal media.</p> <p>The Second Amendment was not adopted to ensure our ability to hunt for food. Nor did it have anything to do with sportsmanship or target practice. Gun ownership is entirely about self defense. And, in the case of the intent of the framers who had just escaped the tyranny of England’s monarchy, the Second Amendment was absolutely provided for the people to be able to defend themselves against tyrannical and runaway government. And this is why the potentially tyrannical and runaway, professional political leaders of today jump at any chance to take guns away from law-abiding Americans.</p> <p>Only hours after the recent bloodbath in Las Vegas, liberal left politicians were instant to make gun control statements, before even offering any sympathy to the bereft surviving friends and family members of the victims of that crowd. The bodies of the dead from that massacre had not even been entirely identified and next of kin notified, before the liberal left politicians vaingloriously marched down the steps of our Capitol building in DC and declared yet another war against gun ownership.</p> Almost without exception, the mass-murdering shooters of the late 20th and 21st century here in America have been leftist politically or left-leaning Islamist terrorists <p>It is remarkably noteworthy that, almost without exception, the mass-murdering shooters of the late 20th and 21st century here in America have been leftist politically or left-leaning Islamist terrorists. The nut-jobs of cultic liberalism or progressive socialist ideology do all the murdering. And then their political leaders vilify and strain to penalize and put additional controls on the conservative and often Christian gun owners who do no violence to anyone.</p> <p>Indeed, the ancient bumper sticker that was so popular back in the late 60s early 70s - “WHEN GUNS ARE OUTLAWED, ONLY OUTLAWS WILL HAVE GUNS” - has never been anything less than 100% true. Whether the outlaw is coming through your backdoor as a burglar/rapist/murderer, or the outlaw is coming through your front door as a 21st century storm trooper in the employ of a government that has just declared itself to be your overseer and landlord, a gun can serve as the only voice of protest either might hear. And both of those culprits are absolutely aware of that.</p> <p>The liberal media and liberal left are currently up on their haunches, fighting tooth and nail to push back the unforgivable insubordination of the majority of Americans who are being reintroduced to the power afforded them through our Constitution. The framers, I don’t believe, ever envisioned the extent of liberty that scrap of parchment would provide for the recovering remnant of righteousness in days as evil as these. And President Donald Trump is the target of unbelievable contempt from the left that thought the end of Constitutional America was finally in sight.</p> <p>Few seem to recall how our last chief executive, America’s first and worst black president, had declared our Constitution to be an outdated drag that had served its purpose. And he once joked that the people who had written our Constitution obviously hadn’t planned on cooperating with the changes he had in mind for our nation. All the while he and his wife were, in eight years of hate-filled speeches, bolting together a race-hate Frankenstein that is only now beginning to walk. They were words that oozed easily from that devil’s brood of smooth-tongued snakes who knew they were talking to a fragmented and distracted audience.</p> <p>Continued below...</p> In a free society, the only control gained from ‘Gun Control’ will be the terminal upperhand given to the elite few who want selfishly to control us all. <p>Our sleepy preoccupation had allowed all sorts of scandal and treachery - from Benghazi, to ‘e-mailgate’, to the Iran nuke deal including pallets of cash shipped secretly to the turbaned friends of that regime. And the cancer of that administration, along with the monstrous enabling liberal media/entertainment industry, thought they finally had a stranglehold on the America they were sure they controlled. Hillary started drinking her victory champagne way too early on that election eve flight to NYC. But that night it was only God’s grace that gave us another four years to keep those wolves and cobras at bay.</p> <p>As I have said so many times before, if the liberal slime (who are now feverishly romancing the na√Øve youth of our nation) ever again fully get their hooks and fangs into our governmental infrastructure, America as we have known it will be only a fond memory. But, in the meantime, it is obvious that the leftists are wanting no guns waiting for them when they finally undo the mistake they made in allowing a President Donald Trump to interrupt their takeover.</p> <p>Protecting ourselves is not a conservative fantasy. It is a God-given mandate. The gift of being able to - WITH THE PULL OF THE TRIGGER - stop bloodthirsty wickedness from ravaging the precious pearls of our faith, love and sweaty labor, can certainly be part of the assignment God gave us as stewards of the liberty we have in Christ. (Luke 22:36, Psalm 82:4, Psalm 144:1, Matt. 7:6, etc.) It is our vulnerable liberty that, like a shining light, allows us to care for our children and openly be the example that God has called us to be.</p> <p>The devil’s battle to take away the bullet, the only ballot that our own corrupt government or an invading one cannot ignore, is truly the last ground in a fight the corrupt political forces in this nation know they must capture. And, as they have shown us to date, the likes of a George Soros, Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton - our adversaries who are making the world safe for themselves - don’t play by the rules when the rules don’t work in their favor.</p> <p>In a free society, the only control gained from ‘Gun Control’ will be the terminal upperhand given to the elite few who want selfishly to control us all. NOW is the unreturning time to rally in support of our President who wants to preserve our Constitution. And with our every opportunity and vote, let us work to preserve our right to defend ourselves. The Second Amendment is worthy of our defense. It is there to defend us. Don’t ever lose sight of that.</p> <a href="http://www.subscribepage.com/g4c3q7" type="external"/></article>

insert picture <p>Rising accusations of sexual assault, abuse, and child molestation are (thankfully) bringing creepy Hollywood to its knees. We should rejoice, since these stories have been documented and released to the public at great length. But do we automatically stand by our men or our team when someone issues allegations against people whom we have trusted or look up to? Ben Shapiro has warned conservatives about partisan responses to allegations of sexual abuse. I agree.</p> <p>Judge Roy Moore has been rocked, targeted with serious allegations of sexual abuse, including with minors. Are these accusations true? Will they sink his campaign? Sexual misconduct is wrong, whether the criminal is a Democrat or a Republican, and anyone who commits such terrible acts should not be in public office. When former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was exposed as a child molester who was bribing his victims with hush money, I joined with Republicans around the country denouncing him.</p> <p>But we need to investigate accusations, not rush to conclusions. <a href="http://biblehub.com/kjv/leviticus/13.htm" type="external">Leviticus outlines</a> the proper stance on moral contagion. No priest pronounced anyone “unclean” with leprosy after the first allegation, but at least three checks took place before a formal declaration. Take accusations seriously, but investigate them whether they are true or not. No one should arbitrarily appease every charge of sexual abuse. Liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz was accused of sexual misconduct last year. <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article71164542.html" type="external">He denied it flatly, settled a defamation lawsuit in his favor, and the world moved on</a>.</p> <p>With clear standards on these matters established, let’s also acknowledge that the corrupt media has a deliberate penchant for going after Republicans over even the hint of impropriety. The mainstream media equated Todd Akin and his “legitimate rape” comment with Anthony Weiner’s sexting. Akin is not in jail, while Weiner just reported to prison for sexting a minor. By the way, it had taken three weeks of repeated pressure from Andrew Breitbart before former Congressman Weiner admitted to his social media perversion. Contrast that media slow-walk with a New York Republican when he was caught sexting. He was immediately chastised by the press and forced to step down.</p> <p>There is a double-standard in the media when it comes to these allegations. The press will “report first, question later” with Republicans. With Democrats, they question repeatedly and try to stave off any coverage when the Democrat is indeed guilty. The liberal media is a Republican Reputation Shredding machine, searching and destroying conservatives any way possible. Sadly, Republicans are still cutting and running, this time because of a WaPo hit piece.</p> <p>Despite the liberal media bias, let’s look at these allegations. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/woman-says-roy-moore-initiated-sexual-encounter-when-she-was-14-he-was-32/2017/11/09/1f495878-c293-11e7-afe9-4f60b5a6c4a0_story.html?tid=sm_fb&amp;utm_term=.1b1d6095f16d" type="external">The first major accuser is Leigh Corfman</a>, who claimed that Moore made sexual advances on her when she was 14.

Without her work it is highly doubtful we would know nearly as much about this dangerous and wildly out-of-control program. To know her, listen to her, watch her on TV, she reminds you of a kindly grandmother, (which she is), quietly but assertively lecturing us to eat our porridge. You could never imagine the ire she has aroused among the radical Left and their allies in the refugee resettlement industry.</p> <p>But she has.</p> Southern Poverty Law Center have branded her an Islamophobe <p>She wrote a short book three years ago, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refugee-Resettlement-America-Civilization-Reader/dp/1508820708" type="external">Refugee Resettlement and the Hijra to America</a>, which is still in the top 30 in the immigration category at Amazon. A <a href="https://youtu.be/6PzT8vEvYPg" type="external">short video</a> produced to promote the book has been viewed over 2.9 million times. Her blog has thousands of entries on everything from the refugee resettlement budget and the despotic, arcane, and highly secretive process by which refugees are resettled into this nation, to the horrific crimes and terrorism committed by these nice refugees that we foolish deplorables are so worried about. Her work inspired me to write my own short (and not nearly as popular) book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Green-Axis-Refugees-Immigration-Civilization/dp/151508518X/" type="external">The Red-Green Axis</a>, and the (not nearly as popular) promotional <a href="https://youtu.be/8u4LfJXzQnw" type="external">video</a> to go with it.</p> <p>But to listen to the Left, you would never know she is a kindly grandmother. Perish the thought! The extreme left-wing smear merchants at the <a href="https://capitalresearch.org/article/southern-poverty-law-center-wellspring-of-manufactured-hate/" type="external">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> have branded her an Islamophobe. Her blog is even mentioned in a pamphlet published by the private resettlement industry itself, titled Resettlement at Risk: Meeting Emerging Challenges to Refugee Resettlement in Local Communities. Yes folks, she is one of those “emerging challenges.”</p> <p>She even attended a meeting in Pennsylvania where representatives of the U.S. State Department and HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement spoke of “pockets of resistance” to refugee resettlement cropping up around the country. We know that many of those “pockets” became motivated by following Ann’s blog. I subsequently organized a group we jokingly called the “pockets of resistance” to mock the industry. But they were no joke. One of those “pockets” recently <a href="https://www.bombthrowers.com/article/rutland-voters-give-frozen-boot/" type="external">threw out</a> a five-term mayor who ignored public sentiment on refugees. Yes to all you refugee resettlement industry “stakeholders,” we natives who pay for all of this crap are getting restless.</p> <p>To be clear here, refugees are resettled in the U.S. through a network of nine primary and 320 affiliate private contractors paid by the head to resettle refugees. In other words, the federal government incentivizes them to resettle ever more refugees in an endless stream.

"Think about it. Plays and music videos said to be depicting the assassination of the president, a comedian holding up the decapitated likeness of the head of the president. Relentless, hate-filled rhetoric," said Graham.</p> <p>Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., blamed the hateful atmosphere in Washington: “Political rhetoric has led to this violent type of activity that has got to stop in this country,” said Davis to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/14/steve-scalise-shooting-political-rhetorical-terrorism-contributed-to-attack-rep-says.html" type="external">Fox</a>.

The Gardener's Idea Book <p>Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is suggesting Thursday that she’s considering taking on the New York Times after an editorial they posted connected Palin to the horrific shooting of former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011.</p> <p>The dust-up began after a Times writer addressed the shooting of GOP congressmen at a baseball practice near D.C. Wednesday by an outspoken Bernie Sanders supporter. The editorial clearly linked an election district map Palin’s political action committee circulated of Democrats to go after politically to the actions of shooter Jared Loughner, according to <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/06/15/sarah-palin-blasts-sickening-ny-times-editorial-linking-her-giffords-shooting" type="external">Fox News</a>.</p> <p>Palin was not happy, writing on Facebook, "I'd hoped the media had collectively matured since the last attack on a Representative when media coverage spewed blatant lies about who was to blame. There's been no improvement. The NYT has gotten worse."</p> <p>Now the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/opinion/steve-scalise-congress-shot-alexandria-virginia.html?_r=0" type="external">Times</a> has written a correction, admitting that, “An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords.

Though it may ring unpopular with many liberals, Trump has just called the entire nation to prayer on Sunday, following the devastating flooding from Hurricane Harvey, reports the <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/president-trump-calls-for-national-day-of-prayer-donates-1-million-for-harvey-victims-197711/" type="external">Christian Post.</a></p> <p>"From the beginning of our nation, Americans have joined together in prayer during times of great need to ask for God's blessing and God's guidance," President Trump told Christian leaders Friday in the Oval Office. "When we look across Texas and Louisiana, we see the American spirit of service embodied by countless men and women."</p> <p>"And behind me, we have faith-based people who are highly respected, and especially so in their communities where they're not only respected, but they're loved — evangelical leaders, Christian leaders -- many people of faith," Trump continued. "And I just want to thank you all for being with us today because we're going to be signing a Day of Prayer, and that will be on Sunday. It will be a very special day. And I don't know when this was done last, but it's been a longtime coming. It's been a longtime coming."</p> <p>Trump himself donated one million dollars to relief efforts, visiting the devastated state earlier this week with Melania and also sending Vice President Pence and his wife, Karen, to partner with Franklin Graham for relief efforts. "After difficult days, the President sent us here, to say the American people are with you. We will be here every day until this region rebuilds bigger and better than ever before," Pence told Samaritan's Purse volunteers.</p> <p>Graham praised Pence and his wife for their incredible work, as they rolled up their sleeves and helped to move trees.</p> <p>What do you think of Trump's bold move to declare Sunday a national day of prayer for the nation in turmoil? Will you be praying? Share your thoughts and prayers in the comments, and let your friends and family know that this day is coming! Thank you!

	<article id="0001267" published-at="2017-12-07" title="K-12: The Schools You Deserve">
insert picture <p>Thomas Jefferson declared: “The government you elect is the government you deserve.” Wouldn’t the same go for a school system? If you select it, you must deserve it.</p> <p>Plato said an early version of what would later be attributed to Edmund Burke: “The penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.” Albert Einstein put it this way: “The world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it.”</p> <p>In education, we have a startling amount of tolerating and encouraging.</p> <p>What part is our responsibility? If we allow left-wing social engineers to take over our country and dumb down our children, maybe we are substantially to blame. It might not be accurate to say we select these people. But we do put up with them. A third party observing us might well conclude we prefer it this way.</p> <p>Jefferson’s quote seem to suggest a cosmic morality or karmic reality that will inevitably reward or punish us. I think with the education people, the logic is a lot sloppier. They’re like a second cousin, not a very attractive person, and he shows up at your door and asks if he can stay the night. His car is broken down. A month later he is still there. You didn’t do anything to deserve this. But you did accept him in your house for a day. You never made him leave. That’s what education officials have somehow achieved. We’re supposed to believe their ruinous presence is normal, is good for us, and good for children. All of which is dubious. These education commissars are arguably a costly drag on the country.</p> <p>Maybe he’s not even a real cousin, merely abusing the claimed relationship. Maybe it’s like Six Degrees of Separation where a stranger tangles you up in lies. Remember that movie? Here’s the story: “An affluent New York couple find their lives touched, intruded upon, and compelled by a mysterious young black man who is never quite who he says he is.” That would be actor Will Smith.</p> <p>In short, he is a lot like the entire Education Establishment and its behavior toward this country for the last hundred years. Claiming to know all about education. No, they apparently don’t. Claiming to be concerned about your children. No, not much at all. Claiming to care about this great country. Yes, they care about transforming it fundamentally, just as Obama promised to do.</p> <p>We are never sure what Will Smith is up to. But we suspect he is hanging around to take advantage of us. If we don’t ask him to leave, then it’s our fault.</p> <p>All that’s required for evil men to succeed is that good men do nothing. This seems to be the essence of our problem. Not enough people did something. Not enough people said, I’m mad as hell and I’m not taking it anymore. The rough figure is that the US has 50 million functional illiterates. Maybe if all the young people were completely illiterate, the older people might start to get angry.</p> <p>What actually would it take?</p> Alzheimer's-Blocking "Super Coffee" May Be The "Memory Saving Discovery" Of The Century <p>Yes, that is the vital question: what would awaken the American people? As it is now, we drift along in a slumber. The media are silent. The Ivy League universities are silent. The foundations are silent. The frog in the not-quite-boiling water is silent.</p> <p>When we stand back and observe our Education Establishment, we are dumbfounded by their audacity. Imagine that John Dewey and colleagues would think of taking over the ed schools in order to take over the country. That they would render children unable to read (this is my conclusion) as a passport to a socialist paradise. They are indeed saucy baggage. They deserve a big dose of contempt.</p> <p>There can be few more useless human beings than those who prattle on about educational advancement while the children are mugged into silence. Almost as bad are the good citizens who allow them to prattle on.</p> <p>So much of what we call educational theory is nothing but marketing. They make up some new mumbo-jumbo such as New Math; and they say this is the ultimate method, just what your kids need. Everything the education professors come up with is presented to the public in this amazing end-of-history language. Finally, they claim, true education is at last triumphant. That’s how we got Sight-words, Reform Math, Constructivism, and much more.</p> <p>Five years later all the kids are a little dumber. But the parents are somehow kept in line. Which brings us back to the punchline. If good people do nothing, bad people will prevail. That is the story of public school education in the 20th century. There has been a lot of prevailing going on.</p> <p>The Education Establishment’s great triumph is to make themselves appear safe, not too threatening, somehow not prime players. All their bad theories and methods somehow turn up on their own, unlucky accidents. There is the big mistake that Americans make.</p> <p>The Education Establishment controls what goes on in K-12 classrooms. Give these people credit, and then give them blame and punishment. If we don’t, then we deserve the schools we end up with.</p> <p>Is it time for President Trump to leave the White House?</p> <a href="https://media.hertz.com/click.ng?spacedesc=42482637_42187369_300x250_42482444_42482637&amp;af=25364&amp;ml_pkgkw=-%253A%2522%2522&amp;ml_pbi=-42482637&amp;ml_camp=42315766&amp;ml_crid=42482679&amp;click=https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/dbm/clk?sa=L&amp;ai=CcJUdy1CFW_apK9bWBsqdl7gGjOqh91KyyNSU3QeL4dOHyAEQASCS2N9KYMkGoAHqu4iKA8gBCagDAaoExQFP0ExSjTAb8CGD_1dUhw7eSb8XtSABLQUqpvFZ7vtJxPNHKroo0XrccmjO-VsbDdQKUdCGetR0TS33h8xvUtNgQ2L9s8nxL4iGkIYH9AEKpuYxhDg7I2yRnRs14Kq3BeTXJSvmFqyaAj8KmJThY0XBUpTJPR4ZwCkpm_FLkeiUS7Ibh_vxgyK5xPRtdzjb-jvUnoprb_s-h9_4VKufXQ5GGLGU3zcdlefOxOxbHhodBH5v-nN0Si4tD3xYVacKsbkUiT_c7uAEA5AGAaAGTYAH_sP3dagHjs4bqAfVyRuoB6gGqAe6BqgH2csbqAfPzBuoB6a-G6gHmM4b2AcA0ggHCIBhEAEYAfIIG2FkeC1zdWJzeW4tODU5MTA3MzExMjQwNDA1MYAKA7ATwuWEBdgTDQ&amp;num=1&amp;cid=CAASEuRojZyhTN4MmxgdzZBKNUpoGg&amp;sig=AOD64_2QSxN0hbonaq0bgHSVyBYnJsk8kQ&amp;client=ca-pub-2393320645055022&amp;dbm_c=AKAmf-A0qgbNkpEVivwNC7aODEIYapD-aanojqaR_LpUd999LZkkqSEop4gx_4vT1yXvkgy2xWdo&amp;dbm_d=AKAmf-BZlxTSHvBr1FIIhYY0kgEf4R71SEO_SXAiKAoYnZQ6fFXrGkKaa5NeCe6Y4VkbDJiDgMIGTVB8Dfa2SOsM0vTpMpoaM6B_9WHCLcc3PNf38UP_RP_bLMRF4GhVp2Vv85yj3iJy5ES65_b4pCYUw_hWXE_DBj_XXYneuAd6Fn0zRGulO33irO91LR1Qxh9azPUzx4GEDdl2YtqnWlo5H0yYbFYlaqrERD76jxjOcQzQE7zidIGdomIcxToAFYWsn9beDSBb3mpKBxNUba3hJYK5sNAjOOTEVhC5c6h5Fskiv_SO-tiT0MnWsKLwwmdGmiaVxPA-hHUFB8pqhtaUKwT4mcZcEvWoOI7ygtBThWlAKzDdXM0ghHwVshQ7sfMEr1DD34o03xOyCFLdGKTkRL0BqEfsefciiLdckKdYKY_6HKj4GsOQi5sItpGXwiA84q8MSaR2&amp;adurl=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N410601.127286TRUEFFECT/B21239105.223179488;dc_trk_aid=421943932;dc_trk_cid=102259033;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=" type="external"/></article>
	<article id="0001268" published-at="2017-10-30" title="Why The Anti-Trump “Resistance” Is So Relentless">
insert picture <p>I revisited election night videos on youtube of Leftists’ tearful meltdowns in response to Trump defeating Hillary. <a href="https://bit.ly/2xo0l5f" type="external">http://bit.ly/2xo0l5f</a> Their panic, outrage and hatred for Trump was over-the-top; truly amazing. I questioned, why was it so intense?</p> <p>I am a black, Christian conservative. Trump is not ideological. Still, I thought Trump leaned more in the Leftists’ camp than in mine. I viewed Trump as a businessman, busy pursuing his American dream, not concerned with the war between liberals and conservatives. Trump simply saw Obama making bad deals for America and knew he could do better. Trump was not overly concerned with social issues, but knew it was weird that Americans were no longer permitted to say, “ <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/10/13/president-trump-values-voters-summit-religious-freedom-saying-merry-christmas" type="external">Merry Christmas!</a>” So Trump decided to get into the presidential race. Political elites and fake news media thought the idea of Donald J. Trump in the White House was the joke of the century.</p> <p>And where on earth did Trump come up with his cornball, obviously un-poll tested, campaign phrase, “Make America great again”? Due to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/06/16/public-schools-teach-students-to-hate-america-as-left-appeases-muslims-with-religious-literacy-training/" type="external">public schools teaching distortions and lies about American history</a>, Leftists are obsessed with bringing down our country from her throne as the world power. This is why Trump proclaiming his desire to “make America great again” repulsed and enraged Leftists. Leftists have flooded fake news media with their absurd despicable lie that “make America great again” is code for white supremacy, social injustice, cops free to murder blacks, destroying the planet and so on.</p> <p>Dethroning America is Leftists’ number one priority. The second most important thing in the world to Leftists appears to be sex and transforming America into a culture in which anything goes sexually. Leftists have been using government to force sexual deviancy down our throats. You cannot turn on TV without being slapped in the face with various forms of sexual deviancy. We have been trained not to complain about it if we know what is good for us.</p> <p>Third on the Leftists’ list of priorities is having as many Americans as possible <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/children-carbon-footprint-climate-change-damage-having-kids-research-a7837961.html" type="external">kill their babies to save the planet</a>.</p> CNN Hopes You Never See This Hillary Video</article>

	<article id="0001270" published-at="2017-06-12" title="Russia Russia Russia"><p>Since the mass media (and therefore public opinion) is swamped with the Russia Russia Russia propaganda, here's a quick synopsis of all the *facts* you sadly can't find on our American television or "news" outlets:</p> <p>To begin with, our elections are anything but democratic or un-influenced. The party representatives are selected by very small groups of wealthy people, who also maintain the chosen loyalist (ie, financially-incentivized) pool of "Superdelegates" for counteracting the wills of *entire states*. When the DNC was sued their court defense was that they have no actual obligation to perform fair elections. They repealed every protection possible against unlimited or foreign campaign donations and lobbying. Every news outlet was Trump 24/7 in an attempt to win it for Hillary through "lesser evilism"- a theory Democrats use often, but which backfired.</p> <p>Forced to choose between two hated millionaires, stuck between the establishment corruption or a liar's claim of anti-establishmentism, left this country totally divided. But the numbers don't lie. The problem was that neither of these warmongering, egomaniac corporatists represented the people. For a country that facilitates daily atrocities on foreign ground by using the excuse of "defending democracy," we don't actually practice it. Such direct control is referred to as "mob rule", and to be stopped at all costs for the "good" of the country. Or, at least for the good of wealthy politicians, lobbyists, and businesses who profit off our military industrial complex.</p> <p>What Russia was accused of doing is merely running a phishing scheme which 'resulted' in Wikileaks airing an email assortment of the DNC's dirty laundry. Ignoring all content (because that would lay some blame at their own feet) and ignoring the polls (which all predicted a Clinton loss against Trump) it became the DNC's go-to excuse that Russian interference was the reason for their loss. Then Hillary-backing three-letter agencies signed off on their "it looks like it could be the kind of attack that one might expect to see from Russian hackers" report, which then got blown up into "Russia hacked our election" through media hype, obfuscation, and repetition.</p> <p>That was the entire source of the supposed moral outrage, and honestly it's entirely hypocritical when we consider how many foreign elections or even entire governments those same agencies have been manipulating with economic and military impunity. Maybe some are OK with corruption, as long as it is only *us* doing it. I'm not. Why should I have more fear from Russia's "influence" than those actively accepting bribes? Does domestic tyranny really come second to any conveniently imagined foreign scapegoat? And why should I believe the word of the same folk proven to (in their own leaked words) have maintained this duplicitous "public and private face"?</p> <p>I am not anti-American, a secret spy, or a Republican by saying that Russian election talk is wasting our time and just makes us useful idiots to the Democratic-funded new "activism" which re-frames our problems with a couple quick historical rewrites and anti-Trump false nationalism. This country is getting split up into factions; remaining divided, those in power stay in power, while we blame everyone else. Yet fixing our governmental and electoral corruption would mean nobody has to worry about Russia. All this inflammatory Red Scare rhetoric simply protects our own domestic terrorists, who still claim without any evidence to be our "democratic representatives".</p> <p>The media-hyped foreign redirection should give us deja vu, and frankly be obvious to any citizen remotely familiar with our history. Or even just to anyone who was actually involved in, or paying attention to the election. If you get your understanding of reality from the sponsored infotainment of American network's broadcasting, unfortunately you're woefully under- and mis-informed. Greatest of all ironies, to believe in this Russian nonsense is to be a conspiracy theorist of the highest order. Yet time and moneyed agendas have been manipulating to hide the underlying truth- that the greatest threat to our country are the politicians who incite war just to retain power.</p></article>
	<article id="0001271" published-at="2011-09-20" title="Why Do Radical Muslims Hate America So Much?"><p>Americans know that the United States has been engaged in the War on Terror for the past 10 years. But how many Americans can answer the question of why radical Muslims hate us so much?</p> <p>The United States has spent nearly $1.3 trillion on the war effort – a figure that dwarfs the Vietnam War ($738 billion), the Korean War ($341 billon), and World War I ($334 billion). And the United States has lost more than 6,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>But again, can the average American explain why radical Muslims attacked the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2011, and why terrorist groups continue to recruit and scheme to attack us? Most likely the answer is no.</p> <p>Jim Denison, a cultural apologist and former senior pastor of the 10,000-member Park Cities Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, sets out to answer that question in his new book Radical Islam: What You Need to Know.</p> <p>According to Denison, who has lived and traveled among Muslims for some 30 years, there are two major parts to the answer. The first part is radical Muslims claim that the West has been attacking Islam since the crusades, with Pope Urban II announcing the First Crusade in 1095.</p> <p>The First Crusade began the West’s attack on the “ummah,” or collective community of Muslims worldwide that transcends geography and time. An attack on any of Islam’s followers is seen as an attack on all Muslims because the ummah, or community, is attacked.</p> <p>British-American historian Bernard Lewis, Cleveland E. Dodge professor emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, writes in his 2004 book, The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror:</p> <p>"In the Western world, the basic unit of human organization is the nation, in America but not European usage virtually synonymous with country. This is then subdivided in various ways, one of which is by religion. Muslims, however, tend to see not a nation subdivided into religious groups but a religion subdivided into nations."</p> <p>With this logic, the United States’ support of Israel in the conflict with Palestinians is seen as America’s attack on all Muslims worldwide.</p> <p>“The Quran requires Muslims to defend Islam. So if you believe we are attacking Islam then as a Muslim you are required to attack us in defense of your faith,” explained Denison about radical Muslims’ worldview to The Christian Post.</p> <p>Osama bin Laden published a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver" type="external">“Letter to America”</a>on Nov. 24, 2002, which says this much regarding why al-Qaida attacked the United States.</p> <p>“The answer is very simple: Because you attacked us and continue to attack us,” bin Laden stated in the letter.</p> <p>Extremists also claim the United States attacks Islam not only by supporting Israel and with our military presence in the Middle East, but also by exporting our culture through movies, music, the Internet, and other forms of mass communication.</p> <p>“They see all of that as an imposition of a hedonist, secular culture on the Muslim world. In their world, at least in most of the Muslim world, there is not a significant distinction between faith and life, between church and state as we might say,” Denison notes.</p> <p>The second major reason to the question of why radical Muslims hate America is based on their understanding of democracy. Because the American people elect the U.S. government and our taxes support the military, Muslim extremists hold American civilians accountable for the “war on Islam.”</p> <p>“There are no innocent civilians. They see us the way you would see Germans who supported Hitler or Japanese who supported the emperor,” Denison explained. “In their minds, you and I are complicit in this attack on Islam.”</p> <p>“In the mind of a radical Muslim, 9/11 was not an unprovoked attack on Americans. 9/11 was a defense of Islam, striking back at the heart of Western crusader, imperialist aggression; the twin towers – financial; Pentagon – military; White House – political.”</p> <p>Again, Osama Bin Laden’s “Letter to America” points to the U.S.’s system of democracy to explain why American civilians are guilty for the deaths of Palestinian Muslims and those in Afghanistan, Somalia, Chechnya and Kashmir.</p> <p>But the vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. The Gallup poll conducted the largest-ever survey of predominantly Islamic countries after the Sept. 11 attacks and found 7 percent of the Muslim world has been radicalized.</p> <p>That means 93 percent of Muslims in the world are peaceful. But that also means that 7 percent of 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, which translates to 112 million Muslims, are radical.</p> <p>“We need to understand that it (radical Islam) is an enemy unlike any we have ever fought, and this is a war unlike any we have fought. Osama bin Laden was not Hitler. They are not seeking to defend a single city like Berlin. There is not a single leader with whom we can negotiate a truce,” stated Denison. “This is the battle of our lifetime. In fact, many scholars are beginning to call it the long war.</p> <p>“We are going to face terrorism just as we face cancer, wildfires, and floods. I am afraid that it is simply going to be part of life in the 21st century.”</p> <p>Denison, who founded the Denison Forum on Truth and Culture in 2009, suggests the United States continue to build relationships with moderate Muslim nations, encourage democracy in the world, promote economic progress in the Muslim world, help negotiate peace in the Middle East, and remain vigilant against terrorist threats.</p> <p>On the web: <a href="http://www.denisonforum.org/" type="external">www.denisonforum.org/</a></p></article>

In what is being described by attendees as "a very special moment but it was also not an unusual one," various Christian leaders gathered around President Trump and poured their prayers over him.</p> <p>It is special in that these praying Christians feel an open door with Trump that they never felt with former President Obama. Comparing the difference between the two, Johnnie Moore, president of the KAIROS Company and an attendee of the prayer meeting, said: "When we are praying for President Trump we are praying within the context of a real relationship, of true friendship," describing it as "a visit among friends."</p> <p>"Evangelicals feel the door to the White House is as open as it has ever been before, even compared to Reagan according to several that were there whose career began back then."</p> <p>But it is not unusual in that they have been often granted access to pray with Trump, as he is very open to prayer and guidance from the Bible. Moore shared, "Various ones of us have prayed with him many times and have been praying for him for a long time ... We believe we are a praying nation, and we begin by praying for our leaders."</p> <p>In fact, says Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church of Dallas, there has "been no American president in history who has reached out to evangelicals to the extent that President Trump has done.

	<article id="0001280" published-at="2017-07-11" title="How We're Dehumanizing Muslim Filipinos With This ID">
IMAGE Gabby Jimenez <p>In 1919, the Supreme Court validated the Philippine government’s action of forcing the Mangyans (manguianes) to live in a reservation or camp based on the logic that our indigenous brothers and sisters from Mindoro were “uncivilized.” Filipinos were thus divided into civilized and uncivilized, where the latter was deprived of their right to liberty. In 1939, the Supreme Court again upheld the logic that our indigenous brothers and sisters were uncivilized when it affirmed the conviction of a native of Baguio for illegal possession of intoxicating liquor, a drink apparently only civilized people can handle.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2000, when the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 and finally gave dignity to the humanity of our indigenous brothers and sisters.</p> <p>But which historical fate will our Muslim brothers and sisters meet? I hope we don’t experience déjà vu.</p> <p>The Police Regional Director of Central Luzon, Senior Supt. Aaron Aquino, plans to issue mandatory IDs that all Muslim residents must obtain and wear in the region. Such a plan is already being implemented in Paniqui, Tarlac, according to Human Rights Watch. The supposedly lofty goal is to “identify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists.” PNP Chief Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa doesn’t see any problem with the plan.</p> <q> <p>A Muslim-only ID would be a denial of the guarantee of equal protection.</p> </q> <p>But no goal will ever justify discrimination and violation of people’s rights—and the logic behind this is highly questionable to begin with.</p> <p>A Muslim-only ID perpetuates if not cements the notion that only Muslims are and can be terrorists. The frequent, unquestioned use by irresponsible journalists of the labels “Islamic terrorist” or “Muslim terrorist” in their news reports have indeed created a false association between being a Muslim and being a terrorist. The logic is painfully obvious: not all Muslims are terrorists and not all terrorists are Muslims.</p> <p>The National People’s Army (NPA) frequently commits terrorism when it commits crime to demand revolutionary taxes or issues some other illegal demand. But the media doesn’t report the crimes as being committed by “atheist terrorists” or “Christian terrorists,” even if some members of the NPA are atheist or Christian. For example, the so-called Manila hostage crisis in 2010 technically falls under the legal definition of terrorism—committing a crime with the purpose of sowing fear and panic to coerce the government to give in to an unlawful demand. But the media called it a hostage crisis, not terrorism. And the media didn’t inquire into the hostage taker’s religion.</p> <p>To really identify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists, we must recognize that terrorists can come from any religious background. If an ID system would help, it would help to make it mandatory for everyone. To impose it only on our Muslim brothers and sisters would be discriminatory and illegal. A Muslim-only ID would violate our laws and the Constitution, which guarantees basic human rights. I can give a litany of laws that would be violated, but let’s limit it to two.</p> <p>First, Article III Section 1 of the Constitution says: “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the law.”</p> <p>A Muslim-only ID would be a deprivation of liberty of Muslim Filipinos without due process. Due process here means that there should be a rational connection between the goal the government wants to achieve and the means it uses to try and achieve that goal. It’s painfully obvious again that there is no rational connection—anyone can be a terrorist, not only Muslims. And belief in Islam or being a Muslim doesn’t make a person a terrorist. There are many peace-loving and law-abiding Muslim Filipinos and very few Muslim terrorists—again, a label that some journalists irresponsibly use (they should really stop using that).</p> <p>A Muslim-only ID would be a denial of the guarantee of equal protection. While the government can classify people and treat them differently in other instances (senior citizens, for example), such treatment should be based on substantial distinction. There is no rhyme or reason in classifying Muslims or Christians—or any other religion for that matter—differently. Again: there is nothing to distinguish a Muslim from a Christian in their likelihood to be a criminal or terrorist. There is nothing. Nothing.</p> <q> <p>Again: there is nothing to distinguish a Muslim from a Christian in their likelihood to be a criminal or terrorist. There is nothing. Nothing.</p> </q> <p>Second, Article III Section 5 of the Constitution says: “No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.” Under our laws, the right to travel is part of our civil rights. A Muslim-only ID would require a religious test for the followers of Islam so they can exercise their right to travel—such as evacuating and fleeing from Marawi and resettling in Central Luzon. The Philippines will seem to be endorsing Christianity or other religions for Filipinos given that their exercise of their right to travel is easier if they weren’t Muslims and weren’t required to register and wear an ID.</p> <p>But regardless of the legality, to impose a Muslim-only ID would lead us further down the path that Hitler and Nazi Germany took. Is this alarmist? How I wish.</p> <p>The Nazis required Jews to wear a yellow badge or the Star of David so they could easily be identified. This heightened, if not cemented, Germany’s anti-Semitism and contributed to the tragedy that is the Holocaust. You see, one of the main reasons why people can and do massacre other people is because of dehumanization. When people are stripped of their humanity and made out to be different from you, it is easy for these people to become the “other.” Someone else we don’t need to care about. Someone else we can treat differently because they are not like us. They are not humans.</p> <p>And so we must stop dehumanization in any form. Drug addicts have already been dehumanized and are being tagged in barangay watch lists. Muslims are now in danger of being dehumanized and tagged with a Muslim-only ID system. The dignity and humanity of all people must be respected. Otherwise, our own dignity and humanity will be in danger.</p> <p>If a Muslim-only ID is further implemented beyond Central Luzon, I will stand in solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters. I will register as a Muslim. I will register as a human being.</p></article>

	<article id="0001283" published-at="2018-05-01" title="Christian nationalism: Good for politicians the world"><p>By Peter Montgomery</p> <p>Why did white evangelicals support Trump? To keep America Christian.</p> <p>White evangelical Christians voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, despite his well-documented character flaws and moral failings. It turns out that their support wasn’t just about hatred of Hillary Clinton or Trump’s promise to give them the Supreme Court of their dreams.</p> <p>A new study points to another more disturbing motivating force: Christian nationalism.</p> <p>The study was conducted by scholars at Clemson University, East Tennessee State, and the University of Oklahoma. “The more someone believed the United States is — and should be — a Christian nation, the more likely they were to vote for Trump,” the researchers found.</p> <p>The scholars looked at whether people agreed or disagreed with half a dozen statements, such as “The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation.” Voters who scored high on that scale believed that “Trump would defend what they saw as the country’s Christian heritage — and would help move the nation toward a distinctly Christian future,” the study’s authors wrote in a Washington Post column.</p> <p>The only other cultural explanation that predicted voting behavior so powerfully was the level of fear and antagonism toward Muslims. Of course, the two are not unrelated.</p> <p>Some Christian-nation advocates promote false history, claiming that the First Amendment’s protections for religious liberty were meant only for Christians. Some prominent conservative activists argue that American Muslims are not protected by the First Amendment, going so far as to claim that Islam is not even a religion, or that Muslims cannot truthfully take an oath to uphold the Constitution.</p> <p>Sad to say, these attitudes aren’t restricted to a few folks out on the far fringes.</p> <p>The Family Research Council, for example, hosts an annual gathering of Christian conservative activists that Trump has attended both as candidate and as president. FRC president Tony Perkins has gushed about how often he’s invited to the White House, and former FRC staffers have taken influential jobs in the administration.</p> <p>Perkins defended Trump’s 2015 call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., saying that “only 16 percent of Islam is a religion — the rest is a combination of military, judicial, economic, and political system.”</p> <p>Perkins’ colleague and FRC’s executive vice president, retired General Jerry Boykin, has a long track record of anti-Muslim rhetoric, including the claims that Islam is not a religion and that Muslims don’t deserve First Amendment protections.</p> <p>Rhetoric that implies that “real” Americans are Christian — like rhetoric that implies that “real” Americans are white — isn’t only wrong, it’s dangerous.</p> <p>Rhetorical attacks on immigrants and Muslims by Trump and his allies, and the promotion of anti-Semitic tropes by some of his fans in the alt-right, have contributed to a spike in anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes directed at immigrants, Muslims, and even people wrongly perceived by attackers to be immigrants or Muslims.</p> <p>That harm isn’t just limited to people in the United States, either.</p> <p>At a recent event sponsored by Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, former diplomats warned that the rise in religious intolerance at home — specifically anti-Muslim bigotry and ethno-nationalism — threatens the ability of the United States to advocate effectively for the human rights of religious minorities facing sometimes brutal repression in other parts of the world.</p> <p>One speaker added that the rise in anti-Muslim bigotry in the U.S. acts as a recruiting tool for terrorist organizations.</p> <p>Rejecting America’s commitment to religious pluralism is therefore not only a betrayal of American values, which contributes to a growing climate of intolerance in the United States. It also represents the abandonment of people around the world who look to America and American ideals for hope.</p> <p>Peter Montgomery is a senior fellow at People For the American Way.

(KSAZ) - The Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway Monument that sits in the far East Valley has been tarred and feathered. An investigation is ongoing.</p> <p>The monument sits near Gold Canyon along the U.S. 60, just north of the Renaissance Festival. The monument bears the name of Jefferson Davis, who was the first and only president of the Confederate States of America.</p> <p>"Somebody had to put a little thought into it, but this is going to cost a lot of money to clean up," said John Rogers in Mesa.</p> <p>The blackened and feathered monument drew some visitors. Some of them took a rather dim view of the damage.</p> <p>"It is vandalism," said Tom Hill of Mesa. "This is state property. State property. It is vandalism. The state controls this."</p> <p>This is the second monument to be defaced in the past several days. The Confederate Troops Memorial outside the Arizona Capitol was spray painted white sometime before Thursday morning.</p> <p>Confederate monuments around the country have been removed or defaced since the weekend as the country grapples with a violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white nationalists and white supremacists protested plans to remove a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee.</p> <p>Black leaders have called for the removal of such monuments for several years, saying they glorify racism.</p> <q> <p>Someone tarred and feathered the Jefferson Davis Confederate monument on US 60 east of Phoenix near Gold Valley. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fox10phoenix?src=hash" type="external">#Fox10phoenix</a> <a href="https://t.co/CLO2kJZg8f" type="external">pic.twitter.com/CLO2kJZg8f</a></p>— Steve Krafft Fox 10 (@SKrafftFox10) <a href="https://twitter.com/SKrafftFox10/status/898260775109664768" type="external">August 17, 2017</a> </q> <q> <p>Closeup of tar and feathers on vandalized Jefferson Davis Confederate monument east of Phoenix. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fox10Phoenix?src=hash" type="external">#Fox10Phoenix</a> <a href="https://t.co/7ltfxYPyPB" type="external">pic.twitter.com/7ltfxYPyPB</a></p>— Steve Krafft Fox 10 (@SKrafftFox10) <a href="https://twitter.com/SKrafftFox10/status/898262752875106304" type="external">August 17, 2017</a> </q> <p>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;SkyFOX video from the scene: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FOX10Phoenix/videos/1474833285898547/" type="external">facebook.com/FOX10Phoenix/videos/1474833285898547</a></p> <p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p></article>

	<article id="0001286" published-at="2017-08-22" title="The Magical Thinking Opposition"><p>My hypothesis is that the political side that is out of power is the one that hallucinates the most — and needs to — in order to keep their worldview intact. For example, when President Obama was in office, I saw all kinds of hallucinations on the right about his intentions to destroy America from the inside because he “hates” it.</p> <p>That was a mass hysteria. If President Obama wanted to destroy America, he failed miserably. We’re stronger than ever.</p> <p>The birther issue started as ordinary political shenanigans to delegitimize the president. I call it ordinary because you see the trick used whenever it is an option, as it was with “Canadian” Ted Cruz in the primaries. Eventually it morphed into a full-blown hallucination that President Obama was a Muslim sleeper cell from Kenya, or something like that. That was mass hysteria.</p> <p>Now that Democrats are out of power, we should expect them to hallucinate like crazy (literally) because the election results of 2016 shattered their expectations. Do we see signs of their hallucinations? I’ll walk you through a few examples.</p> <p>Hallucination:</p> <p>Based on President Trump’s tweets and speeches, I can see into his soul, and it is all darkness and racism in there.</p> <p>Real:</p> <p>If the President of the United States tries anything racist in the real world, the Supreme Court, Congress, and the voters would shut him down in a heartbeat. For example, the Courts modified President Trump’s immigration ban to remove even the perception of racism. That’s a sensitive filter for racism, and I think we like it that way.</p> <p>Society’s standard is that you are judged for what you do, not what you privately think. That’s good because humans are terrible at knowing what other people think, while at the same time we think we are good at it. I know this first-hand because dozens of people misinterpret what I write on social media every day. If you don’t have my type of experience — of being routinely misinterpreted — you might think humans are good at reading minds based on subtle clues. We are not good at that. We might be slightly better than random chance, at best. The problem is that we are dead-certain we are champions of evidence-based mindreading. That is a hallucination.</p> <p>Hallucination:</p> <p>I can spot a racist by how long it takes them to properly disavow other racists.</p> <p>Real:</p> <p>That isn’t a thing. The first rule of communicating is that people only hear what they think you intend to say. They don’t hear what you actually say. If you think someone is a racist, you will perceive their disavowals of racism as too late and too inadequate. If you think someone is not a racist, you might see their statements as politically incorrect and nothing worse. This phenomenon is most pronounced when strong emotions are involved. The topic of racism stirs our strongest emotions. So according to everything we know about brains, we should expect the highest level of hallucinations when racism is the topic. And that is exactly what we observe.</p> <p>To be clear, racism itself is very real. The hallucination is limited to seeing it under every bed and behind every couch.</p> <p>Hallucination:</p> <p>The president has accomplished nothing!</p> <p>Real:</p> <p>The president has accomplished a <a href="http://bit.ly/2wbFe58" type="external">long list of things</a>.</p> <p>That said, we are 13% into President Trump’s first term, and Congress has created no major bills worthy of signing. Congress is tasked with working out the details of bills. The president can’t do his job until they do theirs.</p> <p>We observe that the president has not shown leadership on any major legislation. But keep in mind that Congress produced nothing worthy of leadership. Would any leader be able to fix that? Yes, but I assume it takes longer than simply signing bills that come to your desk. Especially in this hyper-polarized environment.</p> <p>Hallucination:</p> <p>President Trump is performing poorly!</p> <p>Real:</p> <p>Compared to what? The imaginary president in your head? There is no base case with which to compare any president’s performance. Would Hillary Clinton have passed major legislation with a Republican Congress in less than six months? It seems unlikely. But we can’t know because she isn’t president.</p> <p>We are terrible at judging how well a stranger performs compared to the imaginary person in our minds. We just think we are good at it.</p> <p>Hallucination:</p> <p>If you thought some “fine people” were marching with Nazis and KKK in Charlottesville, you are a racist.</p> <p>Real:</p> <p>I condemn all racists and anyone who marches with them. But It turns out that some <a href="http://bit.ly/2wBdREX" type="external">non-racists were at the event</a> to support the absolute right of free speech, including the worst kinds of speech. In this one case, President Trump passed the fact-checking but failed miserably on the “saying the right thing” dimension.</p> <p>He wisely left the facts alone after failing on the empathy.</p> <p>Hallucination:</p> <p>This country needs moral leadership and we are not getting it!</p> <p>Real:</p> <p>The country does not need moral leadership in 2017. Social media has filled that void. The country is unified (let’s say 98%) in condemning the KKK and other racists in Charlottesville. We did that without moral leadership. We want moral leadership, but there is no evidence we need it.</p> <p>We would also like to know our president has the right intentions. But hallucinations on that topic are nearly unfixable. Obama never fixed it. Trump will not either.</p> <p>Hallucination:</p> <p>The way you worded your statement, you made a moral equivalence between the KKK and people protesting the KKK.</p> <p>Real:</p> <p>Literally no one but the KKK and other extreme racists has any trouble understanding that Nazis are worse than the people protesting against hate. It is a hallucination (or political tricksterism) to suggest normal citizens can’t distinguish the moral difference between Nazis and those demonstrating against racism.</p> <p>I could go on, but I think you are starting to see the picture. The party out of power has to hallucinate to make their world make sense. The people who think they are smart and morally pure don’t understand why their side lost an election. The simplest fix for that broken worldview is to imagine there are far more “secret racists” than they first assumed, and those people can be identified by the way they accidentally reveal their “moral equivalence” opinions that look exactly like law-and-order opinions to others.</p> <p>I could go on, but I think you get the idea. Cognitive dissonance hits the losing team hardest. It has to, because only the losing side need to make sense of it all. The winning side thinks things are going exactly as expected. They have no trigger for hallucinating.</p> <p>If our next president is a Democrat, expect the Right to do most of the hallucinating. The Left will think things are going as expected.</p> <p>Update: If you are still confident you can read President Trump’s inner thoughts because of the clear pattern of racist acts he has committed, see if this <a href="http://bit.ly/1iytnWV" type="external">article about the Central Park 5</a> shakes your confidence in what you thought you knew.</p> <p>Remember, President Trump is not the only person good at persuasion. The opposition is running on all cylinders.</p> <p>—</p> <p>I wrote some <a href="http://amazon.com/author/scottadamssays" type="external">books</a> you might enjoy because you love books you enjoy.</p></article>

insert picture <p>Is the entire Mueller investigation a false flag distraction to cover the tracks of the people who really did attempt to undermine an American presidential election?</p> <p>Some background to this part of the plot must include the fact that the former FBI Director James Comey has admitted to illegally leaking transcripts of privileged conversations with the President to the press. Why did he do it? Comey <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/politics/james-comey-testimony-donald-trump/index.html" type="external">testified</a> before a Senate Committee that he orchestrated the leak of accounts of conversations with President Donald Trump because he thought it might lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor to lead the Russia investigation.</p> <p>In an interesting twist Deputy Attorney General, Rod J.

I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former Department officials. The way the Director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions.”</p> <p>Accepting this counsel President Trump fired FBI Director Comey. Then Deputy Attorney General, Rod J. Rosenstein appointed Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate Trump based on his firing of Comey.</p> <p>President Trump knows what’s going on. In his famous tweet where he labeled Mueller’s fishing expedition a “Witch Hunt” he <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/why-trump-attacked-his-own-deputy-attorney-general" type="external">said</a> “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!”</p> <p>Mueller, who is up to his eyeballs in Hillary’s Russian scams, has <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2017/10/31/mueller-is-weaponizing-criminal-law-for-political-gain/" type="external">weaponized</a> criminal law in the convoluted attempt of the Progressive cult to misdirect the public. The denizens of the swamp never expected Hillary to lose. They never thought there was any chance of their nefarious and perhaps treasonous schemes to stack the deck and short circuit the electoral processes.

	<article id="0001289" published-at="2017-11-16" title="Hillary: Investigating me would be a symptom of a ‘dictatorship, like some authoritarian regime’">
insert picture <p>If there’s one thing the Clintons have always been able to count on, it’s that they’re above the law. The rules that apply to the little people Hillary so despises have never been applied to her own family. Time will tell if that’s really going to change but, now that their political power is on the wane, it at least appears as if their ability to dodge the consequences of their actions has diminished.</p> <p>The other day, Dan wrote about the New York Times’s previously unimaginable decision to call out Bill’s history of sexual predation. That alone may not seem like much but, since the Times was once a reliable mouthpiece for the Clintons, it says volumes about their current lack of influence.</p> Uranium One scandal <p>Then there’s that pesky Uranium One scandal.</p> <p>Despite media efforts to portray the whole thing as conspiracy theory, there are still plenty of questions regarding the Russian money that flowed to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was Secretary of State. In fact, there are enough questions that rumors of a special council persist - this despite Trey Gowdy’s comments yesterday.</p> <p>So, the fine, upstanding, leftists over at Mother Jones decided to ask Mrs. Clinton about the possibility that she might finally face a thorough investigation. Her answer, as you’d expect, is 100% wrong.</p> <p>From <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/hillary-clinton-trump-special-counsel-threat-this-is-such-an-abuse-of-power/" type="external">Mother Jones</a>:</p> <q> <p>Hillary Clinton responded on Wednesday to news that the Trump administration is considering appointing a special counsel to investigate her alleged ties to the Uranium One deal, calling the move “a disastrous step into politicizing the Justice Department” and “such an abuse of power.”</p> <p>In an exclusive interview with Mother Jones, Clinton said such an investigation would have devastating consequences for the justice system in America. “If they send a signal that we’re going to be like some dictatorship, like some authoritarian regime, where political opponents are going to be unfairly, fraudulently investigated, that rips at the fabric of the contract we have, that we can trust our justice system,” Clinton said. “It will be incredibly demoralizing to people who have served at the Justice Department, under both Republicans and Democrats, because they know better. But it will also send a terrible signal to our country and the world that somehow we are giving up on the kind of values that we used to live by and we used to promote worldwide.”</p> </q> <p>First, the “Justice System in America” is built on the notion that no one - not even the saintly Clinton family - is above its reach. If there’s reason to investigate Hillary, and God knows there are probably at least half a dozen, then so be it. The idea that, somehow, applying the law to Mrs. Clinton’s actions would damage the justice system is ludicrous. Letting people dodge culpability and enjoy the fruits of their transgressions simply because they have the right last name? Now that damages our faith in the justice system - and Hillary &amp;amp; Co. have been doing it for decades.</p> <p>Second, James Comey’s decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton - after laying out a detailed list of prosecutable offenses - damaged American faith in the justice system far more that any special counsel ever could.</p> <p>Finally, if Hillary really wants to examine who’s been using the DOJ as a weapon, she should look no further than the Obama administration in which she served. From Fast &amp;amp; Furious, to a refusal to enforce laws it didn’t like, to “ <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/25/smoking-gun-email-reveals-obama-doj-blocked-conservative-groups-from-settlement-funds-gop-lawmaker-says.html" type="external">slush funds</a>,” to the mysterious Loretta Lynch tarmac meeting, the Obama-era DOJ was an eight-year morass of dubious decisions and political maneuvering. Holder even ended up being held in contempt of Congress - while being simultaneously praised by his President. In short, it was about as shady as it could get, and <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/323751-special-prosecutor-should-probe-lawless-obama-era-doj" type="external">deserves to be the target</a> of a few investigations of its own.</p> <p>Hillary’s game has always been to portray herself as the target of wild-eyed right-wing conspiracies. She’s been doing it since the early nineties.

	<article id="0001290" published-at="2017-10-13" title="Invasion of Leftist Body Snatchers">
insert picture <p>My biggest frustration is seeing conservative/Christian family members and friends overtaken by liberalism. I think it happens when they’re alone in the dark sleeping. Liberalism takes over their body like in that movie, “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.” One morning they awake saying, “The second amendment is outdated. Jesus approves homosexual marriage. Historical monuments hurt black lives. Rich successful Americans must be punished.”</p> <p>Family members and friends who suddenly embrace the dark side believe they are simply being fair. Fake news media, Hollywood, Democrats and public education pounds them daily with lies about how mean and unfair America is to blacks, women, illegals, the poor and so on. Conservatives/Christians are being suckered into believing various groups are victimized daily by America’s racism, sexism and white privilege.</p> <p>In truth, us everyday Americans are the real victims. We’re the ones minding our own business, daily attacked by Leftist hit squads. Everyday Leftists seek to undermine or tear down another of our principles, values, traditions and institutions.</p> <p>Leftists have launched wars on <a href="https://bit.ly/2yEHXJD" type="external">Christmas</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/2i1Iq1" type="external">Easter</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/2gcbSkB" type="external">Christianity</a> , patriotism, our founding fathers, marriage, <a href="https://ind.pn/2sQCed0" type="external">having babies</a>, the Constitution, pro-football, traditional families, masculinity, femininity and <a href="https://n.pr/L88EZz" type="external">gender distinction</a>. Leftists use their fake news media bullies and political homeys to force their agenda down our throats, while portraying themselves as victims of aggression from us mean, intolerant everyday Americans.</p> <p>The Catholic order of nuns, Little Sisters of the Poor, were minding their own business, serving the sick and dying for 100 years. Obama pounded on their door demanding that the nuns fund abortions against their <a href="https://bit.ly/2fZJYV8" type="external">religious convictions</a>. Leftist infiltrators are Trojan Horses seeking entry to destroy or transform our institutions into ungodly cesspools of debauchery.</p> <p>Remember the biblical account of the sodomites banging on Lot’s door demanding that he send out the angels to be raped by them? (Genesis 19: 1-16) Homosexual activists are banging on the doors of churches, Christian businesses, public schools and Christian organizations like the Boy Scouts of America. They are not simply seeking entry, they have been in these places for decades. Homosexuals are stealthily demanding enthusiastic approval of their lifestyle.</p> <p>What sticks in my craw is homosexual activists being allowed to blatantly deceive and bully the American people. They say they only desire tolerance. They are lying. I don’t know about you, but I have loved and tolerated homosexual family and friends all my life. But that is no longer good enough. The homosexual movement is demanding that we approve of their lifestyle against the Bible.</p> How To Remove Eye Bags &amp;amp; Lip Lines Fast (Watch) Anything less than full approval of the LGBT lifestyle is called bigotry, punishable by public humiliation and economic death <p>Anything less than full approval of the LGBT lifestyle is called bigotry, punishable by public humiliation and economic death.</p> <p>Leftists/fake news media even forbids us to publicly state the epidemic of <a href="https://bit.ly/2gqSs8o" type="external">anal cancer among homosexual men.</a> We cannot talk about how a large percentage of <a href="https://bit.ly/2i1TYl1" type="external">transgenders regret their surgery</a>. We are so bullied by homosexual activists that they will seek to brand me a hater for daring to mention these two studies. And yet, Leftists have successfully convinced many conservatives/Christians that homosexuals are the victims under attack from us.</p> <p>I just want folks to realize we are not the aggressors. We are the ones attacked every day.</p> <p>Hearing conservative/Christian associates suddenly parroting Leftists narratives is shocking and disheartening. At the end of the “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” movie, Donald Sutherland looked normal. But then, he let out a chilling scream letting the audience know his body had been taken over by aliens. I felt a similar chill watching football with a relative who is a huge football fan. He coached and loved football for decades. Shockingly, he said football should be banned because it is too dangerous. I thought, “Oh my gosh, they got him! His brain has been taken over by Leftist sports media.” I asked him if we should ban all dangerous sports. He did not reply. He also said NFL players are heroes for protesting our national anthem.</p> CNN Hopes You Never See This Hillary Video</article>

Has-been Nancy Sinatra. She wants NRA members to be shot <p>While the left side of the political spectrum responded to the mass shooting in Las Vegas with fevered calls for gun controls, which even Democrats admit would not have prevented the massacre, they have done nothing to rein in their hateful rhetoric demonizing Trump supporters and providing clear incitements to deranged individuals like Stephen Paddock to commit heinous acts of violence. Leftist celebrity Nancy Sinatra notoriously tweeted “Murderous members of NRA should face firing squad” – to express her politically correct assumption that a gun, rather than an individual incited by hateful comments like hers, was responsible for the slaughter.</p> Nor are Democrats unaware that their reckless rhetorical attacks can have deadly results <p>Nor are Democrats unaware that their reckless rhetorical attacks can have deadly results. Republican Congressman Steve Scalise nearly lost his life at the hands of a Bernie Sanders supporting Democrat, James T. Hodgkinson, during a baseball game this summer. Just last week a local prosecutor officially found that the shooter committed an “act of terrorism” that was “fueled by rage against Republican legislators.” Nonetheless Union County, New Jersey Democrat operative <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2017/06/16/stay-classy-nj-democratic-operative-calls-for-a-hunt-on-republicans-n2342057%3Famp=true" type="external">James Devine tweeted</a>his support for the assailant. “We are in a war with selfish, foolish &amp;amp; narcissistic rich people. Why is it a shock when things turn violent?” he wrote, adding the hashtag “#HuntRepublicanCongressmen[.]”</p> <p>This was at least honest. The moment Donald Trump was declared the victor in November, Democrat leaders launched a “Resistance” to his presidency. Not a democratic opposition to policies he might enact. But a resistance to his presidency. Consequently Trump was the first president since Abraham Lincoln to get no “presidential honeymoon.” Congressional Democrats even boycotted his inaugural, and instead of confirmation hearings they mounted a witch-hunt against his nominees, painting colleagues like Jeff Sessions as a “racist” even though they were well aware of his stellar record on civil rights.</p> <p>Instead of uniting the country behind its new duly elected president – a crucial responsibility of the opposition party in a democracy – the Democratic leadership then embraced a series of mass “Not My President” protests. The largest of these was the so-called “Women’s March,” which was held in cities across the country and whose two chief organizers were a convicted Islamic terrorist, Rasmea Odeh, and an Islamic terrorist supporter, Linda Sarsour. Months later, speaking from a platform provided by the Muslim Brotherhood, Sarsour said “I hope, that when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad. We are struggling against tyrants and rulers not only abroad in the Middle East but here in the United States of America, where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.”</p> Democrats and their left-wing supporters have been exploiting the tragedy to whip up more hatred against their Republican opponents <p>In Washington the Women’s March featured celebrity entertainer and Hillary supporter Madonna, who, wearing a black pussy hat, announced she had thought “an awful lot about blowing up the White House.” At the same demonstration, actress Ashley Judd proclaimed “I am a nasty woman,” then added “I am not as nasty as racism, fraud, conflict of interest, homophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance, white privilege.” A month later, Judd said of Trump’s election victory, “It remains for me the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my lifetime.” She also grotesquely compared the election result to sexual assault. “Raped as a child – bad. Re-raped by a political system that ordains a clown – really bad.”</p> <p>We don’t yet know the motive or motives behind Paddock’s Vegas attack. But the fact that he chose a country and western concert rather than a rock concert or hip-hop event may indicate an animus against possible Trump supporters.</p> <p>Whatever Paddock’s motives, Democrats and their left-wing supporters have been exploiting the tragedy to whip up more hatred against their Republican opponents such as that expressed in Nancy Sinatra’s murderous tweet. Trump’s defeated Democratic opponent, Hillary, was quick to use the massacre as an excuse to bash Republicans and the National Rifle Association (NRA).</p> <p>“The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots,” she tweeted the morning after. “Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.” Of course, a silencer, also called a suppressor, would have melted as a result of the intense heat generated by a continuous-fire weapon and would have only muffled the sound a little. Moreover, a silencer would not conceal the hundreds of wounded victims falling alongside those not yet hit and warning them of the peril they faced. “Our grief isn’t enough,” Clinton added one minute later in an extravagantly hypocritical afterthought. “We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.”</p> <p>Continued below...</p> Democrats project a steady stream of wild-eyed rhetoric and venomous rationales for violence against their political opponents <p>Hillary supporter and CBS executive Hayley Geftman-Gold used the massacre to rant against Trump and Republicans. She blamed Republicans for the deaths caused by Paddock because they wouldn’t endorse stronger gun control as she expressed indifference to the murders because the audience, she guessed, was probably composed of Republicans. “I have no hope that Repugs [sic] will ever do the right thing. I’m actually not even sympathetic [because] country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” CBS executives immediately fired Geftman-Gold, showing a concern for public civility that Democratic Party leaders would do well to emulate.</p> <p>While Democrats call for gun control they project a steady stream of wild-eyed rhetoric and venomous rationales for violence against their political opponents. This is not only not useful in a democracy. It is downright dangerous.</p> <p>This article first appeared at <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/268086/mouth-control-not-more-gun-control-what-we-need-%C2%A0%C2%A0-david-horowitz" type="external">FrontPageMag</a>.</p> <a href="http://www.subscribepage.com/g4c3q7" type="external"/> The No. 1 Stock to Buy Right Now</article>

One poll says ..."><p>It’s been about three weeks since President Donald Trump <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article174986816.html" type="external">ignited an ongoing battle with the NFL over protests</a> during the national anthem.</p> <p>Now, evidence is emerging that his onslaught of tweets and soundbites may be working to change the way people – if they voted for him in the first place – see the NFL, the nation’s <a href="http://www.theharrispoll.com/sports/Americas_Fav_Sport_2016.html" type="external">most popular sports league</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/11/upshot/trump-nfl-polarization.html" type="external">New York Times’ Kevin Quealy showed the trends earlier this week</a> using results of daily online surveys from <a href="https://morningconsult.com/" type="external">Morning Consult</a>, a polling, media and technology company.</p> <p>A month ago, people who voted for Hillary Clinton or Trump weren’t far apart – about 60 percent had a favorable impression of the league and 20 percent negative – on what they thought about the NFL.</p> <p>Then Trump, at a Sept. 22 rally in Alabama for his choice in a U.S. Senate primary, called for NFL owners to <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article174986816.html" type="external">fire players who don’t stand during the national anthem</a>. Since then, the gap between Trump and Clinton voters has spiked, according to the poll.</p> <p>The Trump voters now have a far less favorable opinion – almost the reverse of where they stood before the president’s speech in Alabama – of the NFL than the Clinton voters. The gap is so wide now that the NFL now ranks seventh on the list of America’s most divisive brands.</p> <p>What might be more interesting, though probably no more surprising, is that Clinton voters also said they heard or read less negative news about the NFL than the Trump voters. Both groups are reading or seeing more negative stories, but Trump voters are taking in more and even that gap has widened of late.</p> <p>That likely reflects the way many people get their news – from a source they perceive as promoting their own values, opinions and politics.</p> <p>Trump’s own hotel chain leads the list of most polarizing brands, followed by five media companies – CNN, NBC News, New York Times, MSNBC and Fox News. The top 15 only includes two other non-media brands, fast-food chain Chick-fil-A and outdoors store Cabela’s.</p> <p>NFL television ratings and stadium attendance also are falling in 2017 compared to recent seasons, but the <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/nfl-tv-television-ratings-down-numbers-national-anthem-protests/l2x7dhlkuubk1tbeftag9ttis" type="external">reasons for those declines likely go beyond Trump, according to The Sporting News</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/09/nfl-ratings-trump-anthem-protests/541173/" type="external">The Atlantic</a>.</p> <p>How long will the Trump voters hang onto their newly found negative views of the NFL? Perhaps all will be forgiven if their former favorite teams make the NFL playoffs.</p> <p>But they might just come around anyway. Quealy notes that negative views of United Airlines that spiked after <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/04/27/lead-marsh-united-airlines-reaches-settlement-live.cnn" type="external">videos of a passenger being dragged off an airplane</a> went viral already have returned to near normal levels.</p></article>

There is no evidence they hacked our election.</p> <p>As for Donald Trump being used by Vladimir Putin, I will buy that he has some sort of financial ties going on, but the idea that Russia helped him get elected is not a viable talking point and continues to be debunked as nothing short of a neo-McCarthyist attempt by neo-liberal conservatives to distract the public from their own corruption.</p> <p>Even Bernie Sanders got caught misrepresenting the facts on this. He told Chris Cuomo earlier this year that he had seen overwhelming evidence that Russia tampered with our election.

 Mall says there is no question she was wrong. You must be 16 and have a valid drivers' license to drive a golf cart on Bald Head Island.

 Mall says after the sobbing children left, she told the officer she was angry that he had upset them unnecessarily.

NFL's Kaepernick sits in protest during national anthem 02:59 <p>Clay Cane is a television commentator and the author of the forthcoming book "Live Through This: Surviving the Intersections of Sexuality, God and Race." Follow him on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/claycane?lang=en" type="external">@claycane</a>. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.</p> <p>(CNN)Colin Kaepernick sparked a media firestorm on August 26 when he refused to stand for the national anthem before a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers.</p> <p>The San Francisco 49ers quarterback <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem" type="external">explained in an interview,</a> "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."</p> <p>I immediately applauded Kaepernick for using the art of protest to spark a national dialogue. People are dying. We are in the eye of a cultural crisis in America.</p> NBA great calls Kaepernick's protest "patriotic" 05:58 <p>Kaepernick put endorsements at risk and clearly angered many. Some complained he was anti-American. On the contrary, I thought his action was pro-American, following in the tradition of Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Protest is an American right, which Colin peacefully exercised.</p> <p>But here is where Kaepernick lost me: His remarks to the press segued into a rant of the type you hear from the conservative right. He said: "I mean, you have Hillary who's called black teens or black kids super predators. You have Donald Trump who's openly racist. I mean, we have a presidential candidate [Hillary Clinton] who's deleted emails and done things illegally and is a presidential candidate. That doesn't make sense to me, because if that was any other person, you'd be in prison."</p> <p>To lump Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the same category is wrong, offensive and uninformed. Trump isn't even in the same category as former President George W. Bush or former Vice President Dick Cheney. Donald Trump isn't a Republican or even a conservative. He's a rich, famous alleged businessman who has money to burn and a disturbing case of narcissism.</p> <p>It's irresponsible for Kaepernick to insinuate that Clinton should be in jail, with words that skirt close to the shouts of "Lock her up!" from the crowd during Gov. Chris Christie's remarks at the Republican National Convention. After months of investigations into whether charges should be brought against Clinton for her use of a private email server, <a type="internal">the FBI director James B. Comey said,</a> "Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case."</p> Mother of fallen hero to 49ers QB: Sitting down "easy" 06:10 <p>I believe the FBI knows more about Clinton's emails than Kaepernick. [Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article included the sentence "We should trust the FBI," which the writer had not intended to include.] In addition, Clinton has owned her mistakes. Donald Trump owns nothing; he believes he is flawless, appearing to make grudging concessions of regret (only once) as a feint when bringing on a new team to revive his campaign.</p> <p>I have been critical of many of Hillary Clinton's positions. However, she knows she is not above critique. During the primaries, she was protested by Black Lives Matter. Her response? She didn't encourage violence and then offer to pay medical bills for people who threw punches, like Trump; <a type="internal">she met with representatives of Black Lives Matter.</a></p> <a type="internal"/> <p>From the start of her campaign, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/hillary-clinton-remarks-prison-reform-speech" type="external">she has offered a detailed plan on criminal justice reform</a>. And while some people accuse her of pandering when she talks to any African-American, there is much evidence to the contrary. Clinton has repeatedly reached out to the black community. She has spoken to black media outlets and talked about African-American issues to African-American audiences.</p> <p>Trump's pitch to African-Americans? "You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?"</p> Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos <p>Kaepernick referenced her 1996 comment "super predators." Sadly, he quoted her as falsely as Donald Trump did. She didn't specifically call black teens or black kids super predators. She was referencing gang culture, but many interpreted the term as racially coded language. I agree, and I despised the term.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Clinton <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/25/hillary-clinton-responds-to-activist-who-demanded-apology-for-superpredator-remarks/?utm_term=.58d2766d69f2" type="external">apologized for the words</a> she used 20 years ago that didn't receive mainstream press until she was running for President. Trump won't even directly apologize for an insulting or bigoted comment he made a week ago.</p> <a type="internal"/> <p>Additionally, African-Americans have held the Clintons accountable for years. It's a myth that African-Americans blindly supported the Clintons. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/upshot/black-turnout-in-1964-and-beyond.html?_r=2" type="external">In 1996,</a> African-American turnout bottomed at only 53%, the lowest it had been since President Jimmy Carter in 1976.</p> <p>The African-American community is not a robotic voting bloc. Cornel West, Michelle Alexander, Marc Lamont Hill, Melissa Harris-Perry and other thought leaders have been deeply critical of Hillary, but with nuance. Hillary Clinton has worked for the black vote.</p> <p>Colin Kaepernick, I want to tell you something: I am a black man who lives in a black and predominately immigrant neighborhood. I, my friends, my family and my neighbors cannot afford a Trump presidency. Our very being would be at risk -- on issues from health care to immigration, to the right to marry to the makeup of the Supreme Court and all that would portend.</p> Hughley: There's nothing more American than silence 01:26 <p>Although Kaepernick is a person of color and has experienced prejudice, he sits in a space of economic privilege -- a man who <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/colin-kaepernick-7751/" type="external">signed a multimillion dollar contract in 2014</a>. Yes, he is entitled to his opinion, as am I. But is he seriously claiming Trump and Clinton are the same? Trump has said things that I've never heard from a Republican nominee in my lifetime. This is not a standard election. The safety and morale of our country are at stake.</p> <p>It takes time to grow into activism. There is space for him to evolve and learn. His intentions were clearly genuine. While Kaepernick sitting during the national anthem was profound, his words about the Democratic nominee were disappointing and, quite frankly, misguided.</p> <p>Colin, your voice is needed. Please don't encourage anyone to bench their vote. We cannot let Trump become president. This is not the football field. This is not a game. You are blessed to live in a world where your livelihood is protected, but for the rest of us, we can't endure a President Trump.</p></article>
	<article id="0001305" published-at="2017-05-05" title="5 Reasons White Supremacists Are The Dumbest Weirdos On Earth">
1. They define themselves with the flags of losers <p>White supremacists tend to use two flags as the defining symbols of their movement: the flag of Nazi Germany and the Confederate flag (YES I KNOW IT'S TECHNICALLY "THE BATTLE FLAG OF THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA" BUT LITERALLY EVERYONE ASSOCIATES IT AS THE FLAG OF THE CONFEDERACY SO GET OVER IT). What do these flags have in common, besides symmetrical designs and WAY too much red? Easy. They're the flags of LOSERS.</p> <p>In an incredibly bizarre turn of events, white supremacists have decided that the flags of two of history's most famously abject losers are the kind of iconography they wanna attach themselves to. Sure, both the Confederacy and Nazi Germany had super-racist belief systems at their very foundations, but they're also notable for getting BRUTALLY beaten because they both sucked ass pretty bad.</p> <p>White supremacists associating themselves with shitty losers? Who could have seen THAT coming?</p> 2. Their heroes prove there's nothing "supreme" about their (or anyone's) race <p>It's kinda nuts to imagine that the greatest historical leader of the white supremacist movement is Adolf Hitler, a man who famously tested out cyanide pills on HIS DOG because he wanted to make sure they worked and didn't want to suffer too much when committing suicide. Hitler, for all of his powerful oratory and bluster, was a weak little wimp (and couldn't even grow a decent full mustache) who sucked at painting and who <a type="internal">pulled shitty pranks and farted all the time</a>. Also, he looked like an insurance salesman with a bad combover, so that should make everyone question his whole "master race" theory on genetics.</p> <p>Who else are their heroic leaders? Richard Spencer, the guy currently famous for constantly getting punched and fleeing? David Duke, the former head of the KKK who wrote a book under a female pseudonym explaining how to give blowjobs and receive anal sex? Steve Bannon, the lumpy <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/steve-bannons-rap-musical-has-been-found-and-it-so-254566" type="external">failed screenwriter</a> who is currently <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/06/steve-bannon-calls-jared-kushner-a-cuck-and-globalist-behind-his-back" type="external">being outflanked politically by Jared Kushner</a>?</p> <p>Every hero the white supremacist movement has holds one thing in common: they're utter failures as human beings (even discounting their inherently detestable belief systems) who are also largely ugly as hell. Seriously, how can you honestly say your race is genetically-superior when your hero looks like this?</p> "Genetically superior" people looking like waterlogged bloated corpses is a weird interpretation of the word "superior." 3. Their most famous heroes are ALSO ridiculous hypocrites <p>Strom Thurmond holds a special place in the hearts of white supremacists for several reasons - his virulent campaign against the civil rights movement, his longstanding record of the longest congressional filibuster in opposition of ending segregation, and for being a hilarious hypocritical racist (okay they probably weren't a fan of this last bit).</p> <p>Yep - Strom Thurmond, infamous racist / terrifying zombie senator, famously fathered Essie Mae Washington-Williams...the daughter of a black woman who worked for his parents (and who was only 16 at the time). So not only was Thurmond espousing racist views and policies to denigrate African-Americans nonstop, but he was sleeping with and impregnating an (underage) African-American at the same time.</p> <p>And in case you're looking for a more modern example (given there is nothing less modern than Strom Thurmond), look no further than Mike Enoch - the pseudonym of a popular alt-right podcaster and blogger who regularly espoused insanely racist, neo-Nazi beliefs - the usual mix of anti-Muslim, anti-African-American, and anti-Semitism... <a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/01/16/cat-fight-on-the-alt-right-neo-nazi-podcaster-mike-enoch-quits-after-doxxers-reveal-his-wife-is-jewish/" type="external">until it was revealed his wife was Jewish</a>.</p> <p>That's the thing about these people - they espouse hatred and ignorance and use their positions of influence in the worst possible manner, and they're NOT EVEN GOOD AT BEING RACIST.</p> 4. All of their beliefs are based on gibberish and nonsense <p>Here's the thing: "race" is a completely meaningless term. There is no such thing as a biological race - we are all humans and part of the same species, and literally everything else is minor aesthetic differences that ultimately mean nothing. This has been <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/there-no-such-thing-race-283123" type="external">the position of scientists since the 1950s</a>, and yet so many people are insistent that "race" is a meaningful way to judge others.</p> <p>Want to know how meaningless the idea of "the white race" is? What was considered "white" has been in fluctuation for as long as the term existed - it's pretty well known that in the earlier part of the 20th century, there was a good amount of racism coming from white supremacists against individuals of Italian and Irish descent. And even as of recently, white supremacists seem more welcoming to lighter-skinned people of Hispanic descent. The point is - it doesn't mean anything, except what racists WANT it to mean.</p> <p>And even if you were the type to think it meant something, ultimately each individual's ancestry is open to interpretation: if 86% of your ancestors were members of what you consider to be "the white race," but 14% were of African descent, are you considered white? Well, we could just ask notorious white supremacist Craig Cobb, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/21/white-supremacist-dna-test-neo-nazi-north-dakota-town/3661791/" type="external">who discovered that was exactly his genetic mix</a>.</p> <p>What it all boils down to is this: THE ENTIRE BASIS OF RACISM IS STUPID. Hell, ALL prejudice is stupid - to judge individuals or groups based on arbitrary categorizations and biases makes zero actual sense.</p> <p>Anyways, just thought we should get that one out of the way.</p> 5. They get mad when you call them racist, even though they define themselves by racism <p>Listen - if you're going to espouse beliefs that certain races are better than others and that certain races should be discriminated against, that makes you a racist. I'm not trying to be insulting, that's just the actual dictionary definition of "racist." And yet, for some reason, people who are objectively racists get really mad when people refer to them as such:</p> Source: Raw Story <p>If you're a racist, at least OWN it a little.</p></article>

The views expressed are his own.</p> <p>(CNN)When it comes to President Barack Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, it has become difficult to keep track of the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-signed-secret-document-to-lift-u-n-sanctions-on-iranian-banks-1475193723?tesla=y" type="external">troubling new revelations</a> that seem to surface almost daily. Outrageous, <a href="https://youtu.be/0h2BE-aG2UI" type="external">potentially illegal, actions</a> by this administration have become so commonplace that many Americans have become numb to the recent news regarding this President's policy toward Iran.</p> <p>We now know the President authorized a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-payment-of-1-7-billion-to-iran-raises-questions-of-ransom-1453421778" type="external">$1.7 billion cash ransom payment</a> to Iran, then his administration <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-acknowledges-cash-payment-to-iran-was-leverage-in-prisoner-release-1471558389?tesla=y" type="external">lied about it to Congress</a>. Only President Barack Obama and supporters of the Iran nuclear deal refuse to accept that the pallets of cash were a ransom payment, even though <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/senior-justice-official-raised-objections-to-iran-cash-payment-1470994380" type="external">it was ransom by every definition of the word</a>. This endangers every American overseas by incentivizing kidnappers and encouraging hostage-takers, and since Iran's release of five US hostages in January, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/another-american-has-been-detained-in-iran-the-fourth-dual-national-in-five-months-to-be-arrested/2016/07/26/84ab02fa-52a7-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html" type="external">multiple American citizens have been thrown into Iranian jail cells</a>. Providing cash to Iran has also allowed the mullahs to circumvent the international financial system as they shuttle much-needed resources to their terrorist proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.</p> <p>We recently learned President Obama <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-signed-secret-document-to-lift-u-n-sanctions-on-iranian-banks-1475193723" type="external">dismantled</a> a key part of the ballistic missile sanctions against Iran eight years early. But this past July, the President praised his Iran deal, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/15/press-conference-president" type="external">saying</a>, "We are not taking the pressure off Iran ... with respect to ballistic missiles. As I just explained ... we maintain the eight years on the ballistic missiles under this particular UN resolution. ... So we have not lost those legal authorities." Once again, the White House lied to the American people about its concessions to the Iranian regime.</p> <p>The facts are clear. The entity in question is the only Iranian bank designated by the United Nations for providing support to Iran's main ballistic missile-related organizations, and was <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp219.aspx" type="external">described by the Treasury Department</a> as "the financial linchpin of Iran's missile procurement network." Ballistic missiles were not supposed to be a part of President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, but they became one simply because he negotiated from a position of weakness. He wanted a deal so badly and at any cost that he let Tehran name their terms.</p> <p>Just this month, the Obama administration <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-08/u-s-loosens-iran-sanctions-to-make-dollar-transactions-easier" type="external">announced</a> Iran will be allowed to conduct US dollar transactions, making it easier for Iranians involved in terrorism to do business.</p> <p>Having the world see an American president bend over backward to secure such a terrible deal has had far-reaching consequences that go well beyond Iran's nuclear program.</p> <p>Before the deal was finalized, President Obama expressed hope that signing it would strengthen moderate forces inside Iran. Nothing of the sort has occurred, as Iran has grown more emboldened by the administration's efforts to protect the deal whether Iran complies or not.</p> <p>This is most obvious in the chaos and destruction Iran is sowing across the Middle East. Iran has continued to develop ballistic missiles, a direct threat to our allies in the region, especially Israel. Earlier this year, Iran launched two missiles, one inscribed with "Israel must be wiped out" in Hebrew, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-vows-to-keep-firing-ballistic-missiles/2016/03/10/77a3edac-e708-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html" type="external">according to Iranian officials</a>, and this summer Iran <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-conducts-4th-missile-test-since-signing-nuke-deal/" type="external">reportedly attempted to launch</a> a modified North Korean missile with a maximum range of 2,500 miles. Iran has also maintained its support of Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that has destabilized the government in Lebanon and is working with Russia and Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria.</p> <p>A senior Iranian official has also <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/09/commander-irgc-supplies-intelligence-to-russia-for-airstrikes-in-syria.php" type="external">stated</a> that Tehran has been providing intelligence to Russia for military targeting, helping Moscow support Assad and his slaughter of innocent Syrians. Russia was also responsible for airstrikes on a UN humanitarian convoy and for decimating Aleppo, formerly Syria's largest city. This ongoing humanitarian disaster is heart-wrenching, and unlike anything the world has seen in decades.</p> <p>In Yemen, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels continue to prolong a conflict that has no end in sight. Before the nuclear deal was finalized, Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/world/middleeast/kerry-us-iran-military-aid-houthi-yemen.html" type="external">said in April 2015</a> that Iran was providing military support to the Houthis. There is evidence Iran <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/10/263001.htm" type="external">continues to provide that support</a>and that the Houthis have directly benefited from Tehran's windfall from the nuclear deal. In recent days, the Houthis <a type="internal">fired missiles at US Navy ships</a> on multiple occasions. However, even as American sailors are attacked by an Iranian proxy, <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/10/263001.htm" type="external">potentially using Iranian-provided weapons</a>, the administration pretends none of this is happening, and is reluctant to condemn Iran publicly.</p> <p>Despite all this, President Obama naively claims the Iran deal is a success. But with each passing day, it becomes more painfully obvious that this deal has made our country less secure, and the U.S. taxpayer money President Obama gave to Iran is being used to support terrorism and help in the killing of thousands of innocent people in Syria and elsewhere. Those who support this disastrous nuclear deal should be haunted daily by these facts.</p></article>
	<article id="0001307" published-at="2017-07-20" title="Trump Just Attacked The DOJ, Gets His A** Handed To Him By Sally Yates (TWEET)"><p>Donald Trump dropped several shocking statements in his outrageous interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-sessions-russia.html" type="external">The New York Times</a> yesterday, and his comments about the Department of Justice were some of the worst parts of it.</p> <p>In the interview, Trump clearly stated that if he’d known Attorney General Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from overseeing the Russian investigation, he never would have nominated the former Alabama senator. Trump also warned Special Counsel Robert Mueller against investigating his family’s financial matters.</p> <p>These statements are shocking and extremely unpresidential, but unfortunately we’ve come to expect this from Trump and his highly flawed administration. But one person, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, isn’t going to let this slide.

been giving him hell ever since.</p> <a

type="external">View Now</a> <p>In a brutal message posted on Twitter, Yates trashed Trump for attacking a “bedrock principle of our democracy” with his disrespectful comments about the Department of Justice. She wrote:</p> <q> <p>“POTUS attack on Russia recusal reveals yet again his violation of the essential independence of DOJ, a bedrock principle of our democracy.”</p> </q> <p>While Trump still seems to think he can fire everyone who poses a threat to him, Yates is the perfect example that just because Trump strips people of their power and positions, he can’t get them to shut up and stop exposing him. Yates has become a highly respected figure after she was responsible for shutting down Trump’s Muslim ban, and the American people play attention to what she says. If Trump thought he could make her fade into the background by taking away her job, Yates has just proved him very, VERY wrong.</p> <p>Featured image via <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;photographer=Chip+Somodevilla" type="external">Chip Somodevilla</a> and <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;photographer=Joe+Raedle" type="external">Joe Raedle</a> / Getty Images</p></article>
